<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>: Ὁπλιτης) were citizen-soldiers of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ancient Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states who were primarily armed with spears and shields. <span style='color: blue'><b>Hoplite</b></span> soldiers utilized the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx formation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> in order to be effective in war with fewer soldiers. The formation discouraged the soldiers from acting alone, for this would compromise the formation and minimize its strengths.[1] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> were primarily represented by free citizens—propertied farmers and artisans—who were able to afford the bronze armour suit and weapons (estimated at a third to a half of its able-bodied adult male population).[2] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> were not professional soldiers and often lacked sufficient military training. Although some states did maintain a small elite professional unit, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> soldiers were relied on heavily and made up the bulk of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ancient Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> armies of the time.[3]
<br>
<br>In the 8th or 7th century BC, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> armies adopted a military innovation known as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx formation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span>. The formation proved successful in defeating the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> when employed by the Athenians at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> in 490 BC during the First <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> archers and light troops who fought in the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> failed, because their bows were too weak for their arrows to penetrate the wall of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> shields that made up the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx formation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> was also employed by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> at the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> in 480 BC and at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Plataea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Plataea</b></span> in 479 BC during the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Second Greco-Persian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The word <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>: ὁπλίτης hoplitēs; pl. ὁπλῖται hoplitai) derives from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aspis</b></span> (ὅπλον, plural <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hopla</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hopla</b></span> ὅπλα), the name for the type of shield used by the soldiers. However, the shield was more commonly known as an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>aspis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aspis</b></span>, so the word <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hopla</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hopla</b></span> may refer to the soldiers' weapons or even their full armament.[4] In the modern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenic Army</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hellenic_Army</b></span>, the word <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>: oπλίτης) is used to refer to an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>infantryman</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Infantry</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> shown in two attack positions, with both an overhand and underhand thrust
<br>The fragmented political structure of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ancient Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, with many competing city-states, increased the frequency of conflict, but at the same time limited the scale of warfare. Limited manpower did not allow most <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states to form large armies which could operate for long periods because they were generally not formed from professional soldiers. Most soldiers had careers as farmers or workers and returned to these professions after the campaign. All <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> were expected to take part in any military campaign when called for duty by leaders of the state. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lacedaemonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sparta</b></span> citizens of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> were renowned for their lifelong combat training and almost mythical military prowess, while their greatest adversaries, the Athenians, were exempted from service only after the 60th year of their lives. This inevitably reduced the potential duration of campaigns and often resulted in the campaign season being restricted to one summer.
<br>
<br>Armies generally marched directly to their destination, and in some cases the battlefield was agreed to by the contestants in advance. Battles were fought on level ground, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> preferred to fight with high terrain on both sides of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> so the formation could not be flanked. An example of this was the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, where the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> specifically chose a narrow coastal pass to make their stand against the massive <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army. The vastly outnumbered <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> held off the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> for seven days.
<br>
<br>When battles occurred, they were usually set piece and intended to be decisive. The battlefield would be flat and open to facilitate <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> warfare. These battles were usually short and required a high degree of discipline. At least in the early <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>classical</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_antiquity</b></span> period, when <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> was present, its role was restricted to protection of the flanks of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span>, pursuit of a defeated enemy, and covering a retreat if required. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Light infantry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Light_infantry</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>missile</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Projectile</b></span> troops took part in the battles but their role was less important. Before the opposing phalanxes engaged, the light troops would skirmish with the enemy's light forces, and then protect the flanks and rear of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The military structure created by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> was a rectangular <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx formation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span>. The formation was organized from eight to ten rows deep and could cover a front of a quarter of a mile or more if sufficient <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> were available. The two lines would close to a short distance to allow effective use of their spears, while the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>psiloi</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Psiloi</b></span> threw stones and javelins from behind their lines. The shields would clash and the first lines (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>protostates</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Protostates</b></span>) would stab at their opponents, at the same time trying to keep in position. The ranks behind them would support them with their own spears and the mass of their shields gently pushing them, not to force them into the enemy formation but to keep them steady and in place. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The soldiers</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Soldiers</b></span> in the back provided motivation to the ranks in the front being that most <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> were close community members. At certain points, a command would be given to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> or a part thereof to collectively take a certain number of steps forward (ranging from half to multiple steps). This was the famed othismos.[5]
<br>
<br>At this point, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> would put its collective weight to push back the enemy line and thus create fear and panic among its ranks. There could be multiple such instances of attempts to push, but it seems from the accounts of the ancients that these were perfectly orchestrated and attempted organized en masse. Once one of the lines broke, the troops would generally flee from the field, sometimes chased by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>psiloi</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Psiloi</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>peltasts</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peltast</b></span>, or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>light cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Light_cavalry</b></span>.
<br>
<br>If a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> escaped, he would sometimes be forced to drop his cumbersome <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>aspis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aspis</b></span>, thereby disgracing himself to his friends and family (becoming a ripsaspis, one who threw his shield).[6] To lessen the amount of casualties inflicted by the enemy during battles, soldiers were positioned to stand shoulder to shoulder with their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aspis</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>' most prominent citizens and generals led from the front. Thus, the whole war could be decided by a single field <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>; victory was enforced by ransoming the fallen back to the defeated, called the "Custom of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>".
<br>
<br>Individual <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> carried their shields on their left arm, protecting not only themselves but also the soldier to the left. This meant that the men at the extreme right of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> were only half-protected. In <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, opposing phalanxes would exploit this weakness by attempting to overlap the enemy's right flank.[7] It also meant that, in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> would tend to drift to the right (as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> sought to remain behind the shield of their neighbour). The most experienced <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> were often placed on the right side of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span>, to counteract these problems. According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>'s Sayings of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, "a man carried a shield for the sake of the whole line".[8]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> is an example of a military formation in which single combat and other individualistic forms of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> were suppressed for the good of the whole. In earlier Homeric, dark age combat, the words and deeds of supremely powerful heroes turned the tide of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>. Instead of having individual heroes, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> warfare relied heavily on the community and unity of soldiers. With friends and family pushing on either side and enemies forming a solid wall of shields in front, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> had little opportunity for feats of technique and weapon skill, but great need for commitment and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mental toughness</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mental_toughness</b></span>. By forming a human wall to provide a powerful defensive armour, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> became much more effective while taking fewer casualties. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> had much discipline and were taught to be loyal and trustworthy. They had to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>trust</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Trust_law</b></span> their neighbours for mutual protection, so a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> was only as strong as its weakest elements. Its effectiveness depended on how well the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> could maintain this formation while in combat, and how well they could stand their ground, especially when engaged against another <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span>. The more disciplined and courageous the army, the more likely it was to win—often engagements between the various city-states of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> would be resolved by one side fleeing after their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> had broken formation.

<br>Body armour[edit]
<br>Each <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> provided his own equipment. Thus, only those who could afford such weaponry fought as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>; as with the Roman <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Republican</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Second_Spanish_Republic</b></span> army it was the middle classes who formed the bulk of the infantry. Equipment was not standardized, although there were doubtless trends in general designs over time, and between city-states. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> had customized armour, the shield was decorated with family or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>clan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Clan</b></span> emblems, although in later years these were replaced by symbols or monograms of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> states. The equipment might well be passed down in families, since it would have been expensive to manufacture.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> army consisted of heavily armoured infantrymen. Their armour, also called panoply, was made of full bronze, weighing nearly 32 kilograms (70 lb). The average farmer-peasant <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> typically wore no armour, carrying only a shield, a spear, and perhaps a helmet plus a secondary weapon.The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>linothorax</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Linothorax</b></span> was the most popular type armour worn by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>, since it was cost-effective and provided decent protection. The richer upper-class <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> typically had a bronze <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cuirass</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cuirass</b></span> of either the bell or muscled variety, a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>bronze helmet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bronze_Helmet_(Poland)</b></span> with cheekplates, as well as greaves and other armour. The design of the helmets used varied through time. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthian helmet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corinthian_helmet</b></span> was at first standardized and was a very successful design. Later variants included the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chalcidian helmet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chalcidian_helmet</b></span>, a lightened version of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthian helmet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corinthian_helmet</b></span>, and the very simple <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pilos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pileus_(hat)</b></span> helmet worn by the later <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>. Often the helmet was decorated with one, sometimes more <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>horsehair</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Horsehair</b></span> crests, and/or bronze animal horns and ears. Helmets were often painted as well. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thracian helmet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phrygian_helmet</b></span> had a large visor to further increase protection. In later periods, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>linen</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Linen</b></span> breastplates called <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>linothorax</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Linothorax</b></span> were used, as they were tougher and cheaper to make. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>linen</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Linen</b></span> was 0.5-<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>centimetre</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Centimetre</b></span> (0.20 in) thick.
<br>
<br>By contrast with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>, other contemporary infantry (e.g., <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>) tended to wear relatively light armour, use wicker shields, and were armed with shorter spears, javelins, and bows. The most famous are the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>peltasts</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peltast</b></span>, light-armed troops who wore no armour and were armed with a light shield, javelins and a short <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sword</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gladius</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> general <span style='color: blue'><b>Iphicrates</b></span> developed a new type of armour and arms for his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mercenary</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mercenary</b></span> army, which included light <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>linen</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Linen</b></span> armour, smaller shields and longer spears, whilst arming his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>peltasts</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peltast</b></span> with larger shields, helmets and a longer spear, thus enabling them to defend themselves more easily against enemy <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>. With this new type of army he defeated a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartan army</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> in 392 BC. Nevertheless, most <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> stuck to the traditional arms and armour.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> carried a large concave shield called an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>aspis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aspis</b></span> (often referred to as a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aspis</b></span>), measuring between 80–100 centimetres (31–39 in) in diameter and weighing between 6.5–8 kilograms (14–18 lbs).[9][10] This large shield was made possible partly by its shape, which allowed it to be supported on the shoulder. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aspis</b></span> shield was put together in three layers: the center layer was made of thick <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>wood</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Wood</b></span>, the outside layer facing the enemy was made of bronze, and leather made up the inside of the shield. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>revolutionary</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Revolution</b></span> part of the shield was, in fact, the grip. Known as an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Argive</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Argos</b></span> grip, it placed the handle at the edge of the shield, and was supported by a leather fastening (for the forearm) at the centre. These two points of contact eliminated the possibility of the shield swaying to the side after being struck, and as a result soldiers rarely lost their shields. This allowed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> soldier more mobility with the shield, as well as the ability to capitalize on its offensive capabilities and better support the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span>. The large <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aspis</b></span> shields, designed for pushing ahead, were the most essential equipment for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>.[11]

<br>The main offensive weapon used was a 2.4–4.5-metre (7.9–14.8 ft) long and 2.5-<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>centimetre</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Centimetre</b></span> (1 in) in diameter spear called a doru, or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dory</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dory</b></span>. It was held with the right hand, with the left hand holding the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>'s shield. Soldiers usually held their spears in an underhand position when approaching but once they came into close contact with their opponents, they were held in an overhand position ready to strike. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The spearhead</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Spearhead</b></span> was usually a curved leaf shape, while the rear of the spear had a spike called a sauroter ("lizard-killer") which was used to stand the spear in the ground (hence the name). It was also used as a secondary weapon if the main shaft snapped, or for the rear ranks to finish off fallen opponents as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> advanced over them. In addition to being used as a secondary weapon, the sauroter also doubled to balance the spear, but not for throwing purposes. It is a matter of contention, among historians, whether the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> used the spear overarm or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>underarm</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Axilla</b></span>. Held <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>underarm</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Axilla</b></span>, the thrusts would have been less powerful but under more control, and vice versa. It seems likely that both motions were used, depending on the situation. If attack was called for, an overarm motion was more likely to break through an opponent's defence. The upward thrust is more easily deflected by armour due to its lesser leverage. However, when defending, an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>underarm</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Axilla</b></span> carry absorbed more shock and could be 'couched' under the shoulder for maximum stability. It should also be said that an overarm motion would allow more effective combination of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>aspis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aspis</b></span> and doru if the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>shield wall</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Shield_wall</b></span> had broken down, while the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>underarm</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Axilla</b></span> motion would be more effective when the shield had to be interlocked with those of one's neighbours in the battle-line. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> in the rows behind the lead would almost certainly have made overarm thrusts. The rear ranks held their spears <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>underarm</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Axilla</b></span>, and raised their shields upwards at increasing angles. This was an effective defence against missiles, deflecting their force.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> also carried a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sword</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gladius</b></span>, mostly a short <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sword</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gladius</b></span> called a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>xiphos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xiphos</b></span>, but later also longer and heavier types. The short <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sword</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gladius</b></span> was a secondary weapon, used if or when their spears were broken or lost, or if the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> broke rank. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>xiphos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xiphos</b></span> usually had a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>blade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sword</b></span> around 60 centimetres (24 in) long; however, those used by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> were often only 30–45 centimetres long. This very short <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>xiphos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xiphos</b></span> would be very <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>advantageous</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Advantageous</b></span> in the press that occurred when two lines of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> met, capable of being thrust through gaps in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>shieldwall</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Shield_wall</b></span> into an enemy's unprotected groin or throat, while there was no room to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>swing</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Swing_bowling</b></span> a longer <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sword</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gladius</b></span>. Such a small weapon would be particularly useful after many <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> had started to abandon <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>body armour</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Body_armor</b></span> during the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> could also alternatively carry the kopis, a heavy knife with a forward-curving <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>blade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sword</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Dark age warfare transitioned into <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> warfare in the 8th century BC. Historians and researchers have debated the reason and speed of the transition for centuries. So far 3 popular theories exist:
<br>
<br>Developed by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Anthony Snodgrass</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anthony_Snodgrass</b></span>, the Gradualist Theory states that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> style of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> developed in a series of steps as a result of innovations in armour and weaponry.[12] Chronologically dating the archeological findings of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> armour and using the findings to approximate the development of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx formation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span>, Snodgrass claims that the transition took approximately 100 years to complete from 750–650 BC.[13] The progression of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> took time because as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> matured it required denser formations that made the elite warriors recruit <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> citizens.[14] The large amounts of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> armour needed to then be distributed to the populations of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> citizens only increased the time for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> to be implemented. Snodgrass believes, only once the armour was in place that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx formation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> became popular.[13]
<br>
<br>The Rapid Adaptation model was developed by historians <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Paul Cartledge</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Paul_Cartledge</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Victor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Handley_Page_Victor</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hanson</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tommy_Hanson</b></span>.[15] The historians believe that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> was created individually by military forces, but was so effective that others had to immediately adapt their way of war to combat the formation.[15] Rapid <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Adoptionists</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Adoptionism</b></span> propose that the double grip, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aspis</b></span> shield that was required for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx formation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> was so constricting in mobility that once it was introduced, dark age, free flowing warfare was inadequate to fight against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> only escalating the speed of the transition.[12] Quickly, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx formation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> armour became widely used throughout <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ancient Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cartledge</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Frank_Cartledge</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hanson</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tommy_Hanson</b></span> estimate the transition took place from 725–675 BC.[15]
<br>
<br>Developed by Hans <span style='color: blue'><b>Van</b></span> Wees, the Extended Gradualist theory is the most lengthy of the three popular transition theories. <span style='color: blue'><b>Van</b></span> Wees depicts <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>iconography</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iconography</b></span> found on pots of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dark Ages</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_Dark_Ages</b></span> believing that the foundation of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx formation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> was birthed during this time.[12] Specifically, he uses an example of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chigi Vase</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chigi_vase</b></span> to point out that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> soldiers were carrying normal spears as well as javelins on their backs. Matured <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> did not carry long range weapons including javelins.[13] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chigi vase</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chigi_vase</b></span> is important for our knowledge of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> soldier because it is one, if not the only one representation of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> formation, known as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span>, in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek art</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_art</b></span>.[16] This led <span style='color: blue'><b>Van</b></span> Wees to believe that there was a transitional period from long <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>range warfare</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Range_Warfare</b></span> of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dark Ages</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_Dark_Ages</b></span> to the close combat of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> warfare. Some other evidence of a transitional period lies within the text of Spartan Poet <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tyrtaios</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrtaeus</b></span>, when he wrote, "…will they draw back for the pounding [of the missiles, no,] despite the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battery</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artillery_battery</b></span> of great hurl-stones, the helmets shall abide the rattle [of war unbowed]".[17] At no point in future texts does <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tyrtaios</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrtaeus</b></span> involve any talk of missiles or rocks making another case for a transitional period. Extended Gradualists argue that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> warriors did not fight in a true <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> until the 5th century BC.[12] Making estimations of the speed of the transition reached as long as 300 years, from 750–450 BC.
<br>
<br>The exact time when <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> warfare was developed is uncertain, the prevalent theory being that it was established sometime during the 8th or 7th century BC, when the "heroic age was abandoned and a far more disciplined system introduced" and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Argive</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Argos</b></span> shield became popular.[18] Peter Krentz argues that "the ideology of hoplitic warfare as a ritualized contest developed not in the 7th century [BC], but only after 480, when non-hoplite arms began to be excluded from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span>".[19] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Anagnostis Agelarakis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anagnostis_Agelarakis</b></span>, based on recent archaeo-anthropological discoveries of the earliest monumental polyandrion (communal burial of male warriors) at <span style='color: blue'><b>Paros</b></span> Island in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, unveils a last quarter of the 8th century BC date for a hoplitic phalangeal military organization.[20]
<br>
<br>The rise and fall of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> warfare was tied to the rise and fall of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city-state</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Polis</b></span>. As discussed above, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> were a solution to the armed clashes between independent city-states. As <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> civilization found itself confronted by the world at large, particularly the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, the emphasis in warfare shifted. Confronted by huge numbers of enemy troops, individual city-states could not realistically fight alone. During the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> (499–448 BC), alliances between groups of cities (whose composition varied over time) fought against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. This drastically altered the scale of warfare and the numbers of troops involved. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> proved itself far superior to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> infantry at such conflicts as the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, and the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Plataea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Plataea</b></span>.

<br>During this period, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> rose to a position of political eminence in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, and their rivalry in the aftermath of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> wars brought <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> into renewed internal conflict. However, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> was on a scale unlike conflicts before. Fought between leagues of cities, dominated by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> respectively, the pooled manpower and financial resources allowed a diversification of warfare. <span style='color: blue'><b>Hoplite</b></span> warfare was in decline; there were three major battles in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span>, and none proved decisive. Instead there was increased reliance on navies, skirmishers, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mercenaries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mercenary</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> walls, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span> engines, and non-set piece tactics. These reforms made wars of attrition possible and greatly increased the number of casualties. In the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> war, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> faced large numbers of skirmishers and missile-armed troops, and such troops (e.g., <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>peltasts</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peltast</b></span>) became much more commonly used by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> during the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span>. As a result, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> began wearing less armour, carrying shorter swords, and in general adapting for greater mobility; this led to the development of the ekdromos light <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Many famous personalities, philosophers, artists, and poets fought as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>.[21][22]
<br>
<br>According to Nefiodkin, fighting against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>heavy infantry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Heavy_infantry</b></span> during the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> inspired the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> to introduce scythed chariots.[23]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> is one of the most famous city-states, along with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, which had a unique position in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ancient Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. Contrary to other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> states, the free citizens of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> served as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> their entire life, training and exercising also in peacetime, which gave <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> a professional <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>standing army</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Standing_army</b></span>. Although small, numbering no more than 1,500 to 2,000 men,[citation needed] divided into six <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mora</span> <span style='color: green'><b>South_African_contract_law</b></span> or battalions, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartan army</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> was feared for its discipline and ferocity. Military service was the primary duty of Spartan men, and Spartan society was organized around its army.

<br>Military service for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> lasted until the age of 40, and sometimes even until 60 years of age, depending on a man's physical ability to perform on the battlefield.
<br>
<br>Later on in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> era, more sophisticated tactics were developed, in particular by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Theban</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Theban_hegemony</b></span> general <span style='color: blue'><b>Epaminondas</b></span>. These tactics inspired the future king <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Philip II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Philip_II_of_Macedon</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span>, who was at the time a hostage in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia</b></span>, and also inspired the development of new kind of infantry, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedonian phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Macedonian_army</b></span>. After the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Macedonians</b></span> conquests of the 4th century BC, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> was slowly abandoned in favour of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalangite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Macedonian_phalanx</b></span>, armed in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Macedonians</b></span> fashion, in the armies of the southern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> states. Although clearly a development of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedonian phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Macedonian_army</b></span> was tactically more versatile, especially used in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>combined arms</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Combined_arms</b></span> tactics favoured by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Macedonians</b></span>. These forces defeated the last major <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> army, at the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Chaeronea</b></span> (338 BC), after which <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and its allies joined the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedonian empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Macedonia_(ancient_kingdom)</b></span>.
<br>
<br>While <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span>'s army mainly fielded <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pezhetairoi</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pezhetairos</b></span> (= Foot Companions) as his main force, it is known that his army also included some classic <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>, either provided by the League of <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> or from hired <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mercenaries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mercenary</b></span>. Beside these units, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Macedonians</b></span> also used the so-called <span style='color: blue'><b>Hypaspists</b></span>, an elite force of units possibly originally fighting as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> and used to guard the exposed right wing of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span>'s <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span>.

<br>Hoplite-style warfare was very influential and influenced several other nations in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mediterranean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mediterranean_Sea</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Hoplite</b></span> warfare was the dominant fighting style on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Italian Peninsula</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Italian_Peninsula</b></span> up to the early 3rd century BC, employed by both the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Etruscans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Etruscan_civilization</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Early Roman army</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Early_Roman_army</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Romans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Republic</b></span> later changed their fighting style to a more flexible <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>maniple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Maniple_(military_unit)</b></span> organization, which was more versatile on rough terrain like that of <span style='color: blue'><b>Samnium</b></span>. Roman equipment also changed, and they reequipped their soldiers with longer oval shields (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>scutum</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Scute</b></span>), swords and heavy javelins (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pilum</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pilum</b></span>). In the end only the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>triarii</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Triarii</b></span> would keep a long spear (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hasta</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nakshatra</b></span>) as their main weapon. However, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>triarii</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Triarii</b></span> would still fight in a traditional <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx formation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span>. Though the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Italian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kingdom_of_Italy</b></span> tribes, namely the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>socii</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Socii</b></span> fighting with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Romans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Republic</b></span>, later adopted the new Roman fighting style, some continued to fight as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>. Local levied troops or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mercenaries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mercenary</b></span> serving under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pyrrhus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pyrrhus_of_Epirus</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Epirus</b></span> or <span style='color: blue'><b>Hannibal</b></span> (namely <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Etruscans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Etruscan_civilization</b></span>) were equipped and fought as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Early in its history, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ancient Carthage</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Carthage</b></span> also equipped its troops as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>, in units such as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sacred Band</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sacred_Band_of_Thebes</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Carthage</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Carthage</b></span>. Many <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mercenaries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mercenary</b></span> also fought in foreign armies, such as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Carthage</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Carthage</b></span> and Achaemenid <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span>, where it is believed by some that they inspired the formation of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Cardaces</b></span>. Some <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> served under the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Illyrian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Illyrians</b></span> king <span style='color: blue'><b>Bardylis</b></span> in the 4th century. The <span style='color: blue'><b>Illyrians</b></span> were known to import many weapons and tactics from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue'><b>Diadochi</b></span> imported the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> to their kingdoms. Though they mostly fielded <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> citizens or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mercenaries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mercenary</b></span>, they also armed and drilled <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>local natives</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Local_Natives</b></span> as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> or rather <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedonian phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Macedonian_army</b></span>, like the <span style='color: blue'><b>Machimoi</b></span> of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ptolemaic army</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemaic_army</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> armies of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenistic period</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hellenistic_period</b></span> mostly fielded troops in the fashion of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedonian phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Macedonian_army</b></span>. Nonetheless many armies of mainland <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> stuck with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> warfare. Besides <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>classical</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_antiquity</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenistic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hellenistic_period</b></span> nations began to field two new types of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thureophoroi</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thyreophoroi</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue'><b>Thorakitai</b></span>. They developed when <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> adopted the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Celtic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Celts</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thureos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thyreos</b></span> shield, of an oval shape that was similar to the shields of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Romans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Republic</b></span>, but flatter. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thureophoroi</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thyreophoroi</b></span> were armed with a long thrusting spear, a short <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sword</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gladius</b></span> and, if needed, javelins. While the <span style='color: blue'><b>Thorakitai</b></span> were similar to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thureophoroi</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thyreophoroi</b></span>, they were more heavily armoured, as their name implies, usually wearing a mail shirt. These troops were used as a link between the light infantry and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span>, a form of medium infantry to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>bridge</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bridge</b></span>
