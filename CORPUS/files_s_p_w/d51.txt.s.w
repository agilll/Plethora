The Peace of Callias_II is a purported treaty established around 449 BC between the Delian_League (led by Classical_Athens) and Achaemenid_Empire, ending the Greco-Persian_Wars. The peace was agreed as the first compromise treaty between Achaemenid_Empire and a Ancient_Greece City.

The peace was negotiated by Callias_II, an Delian_League politician. Achaemenid_Empire had continually lost territory to the Ancient_Greece after the end of Xerxes_I's invasion in 479 BC. The exact date of the treaty is debated, although it is usually placed after the Battle of the Giants_(Greek_mythology) in 469 or 466 or the Battle of Cyprus Wars_of_the_Delian_League c. 449. The Peace of Callias_II gave autonomy to the Ionia states in Anatolia, prohibited the encroachment of Achaemenid_Empire Satrap within three days march of the Aegean_Sea coast, and prohibited Achaemenid_Empire ships from the Aegean_Sea. Classical_Athens also agreed not to interfere with Achaemenid_Empire's possessions in Anatolia, Cyprus, Ancient_Libya or Ptolemaic_Kingdom [1](Classical_Athens had recently lost a fleet aiding an Ptolemy_V_Epiphanes against Achaemenid_Empire[2]).

Our knowledge of the Peace of Callias_II comes from references by the 4th century BC orators Isocrates and Demosthenes as well as the historian Diodorus.[3] The Ancient_history Theopompus deemed it a fabrication arguing that the inscription of the treaty was a fake – the lettering used hadn't come into practice until half a century after the treaty was purported to have been agreed. It is possible that the treaty never officially existed, and if it was concluded, its importance is disputed. Thucydides did not mention it, but Herodotus[4] says something that may reasonably be construed as supporting its existence, as does Plutarch, who thought it had either been signed after the Battle of the Giants_(Greek_mythology) in 466 BC, or that it had never been signed at all. In any case, there seems to have been some agreement reached ending hostilities with Achaemenid_Empire after 450/449, which allowed Classical_Athens to deal with the new threats from the other Ancient_Greece states such as Corinth and Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia, as well as Euboea which rebelled from the Delian_League shortly after this. These conflicts may have arisen when Delian_League 'allies' felt there was no longer a justification for the Delian_League (which had developed from the Spartan-led Greco-Persian_Wars that defeated Xerxes_I' invasion), as Achaemenid_Empire was apparently no longer a threat. As Classical_Athens demanded more and more tribute and exerted more political and economic control over its allies, the League became more of a true empire, and many of Classical_Athens' 'allies' began to rebel. Although Callias_II was also responsible for a peace (The Thirty_Years'_Peace) with Sparta in 446–445 BC, the growing Delian_League threat would eventually lead to the Peloponnesian_War.

Fighting between the Ancient_Greece and the Achaemenid_Empire subsided after 450, but Achaemenid_Empire continued to Meddle in Ancient_Greece affairs and was to become instrumental in securing a Spartan victory in the Peloponnesian_War
