<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> (/hɪˈrɒdətəs/; <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>: Ἡρόδοτος, Hêródotos, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attic_Greek?lang=en'>Attic_Greek</a> pronunciation: [hɛː.ró.do.tos]) was a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> historian who was born in Halicarnassus in the Persian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire?lang=en'>Roman_Empire</a> (modern-day <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bodrum?lang=en'>Bodrum</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire?lang=en'>Ottoman_Empire</a>) and lived in the fifth century BC (c. 484–c. 425 BC), a contemporary of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Socrates?lang=en'>Socrates</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Euripides?lang=en'>Euripides</a>. He is often referred to as "The Father of History", a title first conferred by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cicero?lang=en'>Cicero</a>;[1] he was the first historian known to have broken from Homeric tradition to treat historical subjects as a method of investigation—specifically, by collecting his materials systematically and critically, and then arranging them into a historiographic narrative.[2]
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> is the only work which he is known to have produced, a record of his "inquiry" (ἱστορία historía) on the origins of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greco-Persian_Wars?lang=en'>Greco-Persian_Wars</a>; it primarily deals with the lives of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Croesus?lang=en'>Croesus</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Great?lang=en'>Cyrus_the_Great</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_II?lang=en'>Cambyses_II</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bardiya?lang=en'>Bardiya</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a> and the battles of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Battle_of_Marathon</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Thermopylae?lang=en'>Battle_of_Thermopylae</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Artemisium?lang=en'>Battle_of_Artemisium</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Battle_of_Salamis</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Plataea?lang=en'>Battle_of_Plataea</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Mycale?lang=en'>Battle_of_Mycale</a>; however, its many cultural, ethnographical, geographical, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Historiography?lang=en'>Historiography</a>, and other digressions form a defining and essential part of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> and contain a wealth of information. Some of his stories are fanciful and others inaccurate, yet he states that he is reporting only what he was told; a sizable portion of the information he provided was later confirmed by historians and archaeologists.
<br>
<br>Despite <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>'s historical significance, little is known of his personal life.
<br>
<br>Here are presented the results of the enquiry carried out by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> of Halicarnassus. The purpose is to prevent the traces of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_Events?lang=en'>Human_Events</a> from being erased by time, and to preserve the fame of the important and remarkable achievements produced by both <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> and non-Greeks; among the matters covered is, in particular, the cause of the hostilities between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> and non-Greeks.
<br>
<br>His record of the achievements of others was an achievement in itself, though the extent of it has been debated. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>'s place in history and his significance may be understood according to the traditions within which he worked. His work is the earliest <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> prose to have survived intact. However, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus?lang=en'>Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus</a>, a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Literary_criticism?lang=en'>Literary_criticism</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustus?lang=en'>Augustus</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome?lang=en'>Ancient_Rome</a>, listed seven predecessors of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, describing their works as simple, unadorned accounts of their own and other cities and people, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> or foreign, including popular legends, sometimes melodramatic and naïve, often charming – all traits that can be found in the work of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> himself.[4]
<br>
<br>Modern historians regard the chronology as uncertain, but according to the ancient account, these predecessors included <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus?lang=en'>Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yugoloth?lang=en'>Yugoloth</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lampsacus?lang=en'>Lampsacus</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hellanicus_of_Lesbos?lang=en'>Hellanicus_of_Lesbos</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lesbos?lang=en'>Lesbos</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xanthos?lang=en'>Xanthos</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lydia?lang=en'>Lydia</a> and, the best attested of them all, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hecataeus_of_Miletus?lang=en'>Hecataeus_of_Miletus</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a>. Of these, only fragments of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hecataeus_of_Miletus?lang=en'>Hecataeus_of_Miletus</a>'s works survived, and the authenticity of these is debatable,[5] but they provide a glimpse into the kind of tradition within which <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> wrote his own <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hecataeus_of_Miletus?lang=en'>Hecataeus_of_Miletus</a> the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a> speaks thus: I write these things as they seem true to me; for the stories told by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> are various and in my opinion absurd.
<br>
<br>This points forward to the "folksy" yet "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_law?lang=en'>International_law</a>" outlook typical of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>. However, one modern scholar has described the work of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hecataeus_of_Miletus?lang=en'>Hecataeus_of_Miletus</a> as "a curious <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/False_start?lang=en'>False_start</a> to history",[6] since despite his critical spirit, he failed to liberate history from myth. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> mentions <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hecataeus_of_Miletus?lang=en'>Hecataeus_of_Miletus</a> in his <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, on one occasion mocking him for his naive <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Genealogy?lang=en'>Genealogy</a> and, on another occasion, quoting <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> complaints against his handling of their national history.[7] It is possible that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> borrowed much material from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hecataeus_of_Miletus?lang=en'>Hecataeus_of_Miletus</a>, as stated by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Porphyry_of_Gaza?lang=en'>Porphyry_of_Gaza</a> in a quote recorded by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eusebius?lang=en'>Eusebius</a>.[8] In particular, it is possible that he copied descriptions of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crocodile?lang=en'>Crocodile</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hippopotamus?lang=en'>Hippopotamus</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fenghuang?lang=en'>Fenghuang</a> from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hecataeus_of_Miletus?lang=en'>Hecataeus_of_Miletus</a>'s <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Circumnavigation?lang=en'>Circumnavigation</a> of the Known World (Periegesis / Periodos ges), even misrepresenting the source as "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gods_(Marvel_Comics)?lang=en'>Gods_(Marvel_Comics)</a>" (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> 2.73).[9]
<br>
<br>But <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hecataeus_of_Miletus?lang=en'>Hecataeus_of_Miletus</a> did not record events that had occurred in living <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memory?lang=en'>Memory</a>, unlike <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, nor did he include the oral traditions of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> history within the larger framework of oriental history.[10] There is no proof that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> derived the ambitious scope of his own work, with its grand theme of civilizations in conflict, from any predecessor, despite much scholarly speculation about this in modern times.[6][11] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> claims to be better informed than his predecessors by relying on empirical observation to correct their excessive schematism. For example, he argues for continental asymmetry as opposed to the older theory of a perfectly circular earth with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe?lang=en'>Europe</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a>/<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Africa?lang=en'>Africa</a> equal in size (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> 4.36 and 4.42). However, he retains idealizing tendencies, as in his symmetrical notions of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Danube?lang=en'>Danube</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nile?lang=en'>Nile</a>.[12]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/His_Debt?lang=en'>His_Debt</a> to previous authors of prose "histories" might be questionable, but there is no doubt that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> owed much to the example and inspiration of poets and story-tellers. For example, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> tragic poets provided him with a world-view of a balance between conflicting forces, upset by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hubris?lang=en'>Hubris</a> of kings, and they provided his narrative with a model of episodic structure. His familiarity with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> tragedy is demonstrated in a number of passages echoing <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aeschylus?lang=en'>Aeschylus</a>'s <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Persians?lang=en'>The_Persians</a>, including the epigrammatic observation that the defeat of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> navy at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Battle_of_Salamis</a> caused the defeat of the land army (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> 8.68 ~ <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Persians?lang=en'>The_Persians</a> 728). <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Debt_(2010_film)?lang=en'>The_Debt_(2010_film)</a> may have been repaid by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sophocles?lang=en'>Sophocles</a> because there appear to be echoes of The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> in his plays, especially a passage in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Antigone?lang=en'>Antigone</a> that resembles <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>'s account of the death of Intaphernes (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> 3.119 ~ <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Antigone?lang=en'>Antigone</a> 904-920).[13] However, this point is one of the most contentious issues in modern scholarship.[14]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer?lang=en'>Homer</a> was another inspirational source.[b] Just as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer_Drew?lang=en'>Homer_Drew</a> extensively on a tradition of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oral_literature?lang=en'>Oral_literature</a>, sung by wandering minstrels, so <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> appears to have drawn on an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a> tradition of story-telling, collecting and interpreting the oral histories he chanced upon in his travels. These oral histories often contained folk-tale motifs and demonstrated a moral, yet they also contained substantial facts relating to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Geography?lang=en'>Geography</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anthropology?lang=en'>Anthropology</a>, and history, all compiled by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> in an entertaining style and format.[16]
<br>
<br>It is on account of the many strange stories and the folk-tales he reported that his critics in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Early_modern_period?lang=en'>Early_modern_period</a> times branded him "The Father of Lies".[17][18] Even his own contemporaries found reason to scoff at his achievement. In fact, one modern scholar[19] has wondered if <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> left his home in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a>, migrating westwards to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> and beyond, because his own countrymen had ridiculed his work, a circumstance possibly hinted at in an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epitaph?lang=en'>Epitaph</a> said to have been dedicated to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> at one of his three supposed resting places, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thurian_Age?lang=en'>Thurian_Age</a>:
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> the son of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sphinx?lang=en'>Sphinx</a> 
<br>lies; in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a> history without peer; 
<br>a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dorians?lang=en'>Dorians</a> born, who fled from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Defamation?lang=en'>Defamation</a>'s brand 
<br>and made in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thurian_Age?lang=en'>Thurian_Age</a> his new native land.[20]
<br>
<br>Yet it was in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> where his most <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Formidable-class_frigate?lang=en'>Formidable-class_frigate</a> contemporary critics could be found. In 425 BC, which is about the time that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> is thought by many scholars to have died, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> comic <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theatre_of_ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Theatre_of_ancient_Greece</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristophanes?lang=en'>Aristophanes</a> created <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Acharnians?lang=en'>The_Acharnians</a>, in which he blames the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_War</a> on the abduction of some prostitutes – a mocking reference to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, who reported the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>' account of their wars with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>, beginning with the rapes of the mythical heroines <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_locations_in_Babylon_5?lang=en'>List_of_locations_in_Babylon_5</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europa_F.C.?lang=en'>Europa_F.C.</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medea?lang=en'>Medea</a>, and Helen.[21][22]
<br>
<br>Similarly, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> historian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> dismissed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> as a "logos-writer" (story-teller).[23] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>, who had been trained in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rhetoric?lang=en'>Rhetoric</a>, became the model for subsequent prose-writers as an author who seeks to appear firmly in control of his material, whereas with his frequent digressions <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> appeared to minimize (or possibly disguise) his authorial control.[24] Moreover, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> developed a historical topic more in keeping with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> world-view: focused on the context of the polis or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polis?lang=en'>Polis</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Interplay_Entertainment?lang=en'>Interplay_Entertainment</a> of civilizations was more relevant to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> living in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a>, such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> himself, for whom life within a foreign civilization was a recent <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memory?lang=en'>Memory</a>.[23]
<br>
<br>Before the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> crisis, history had been represented among the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> only by local or family traditions. The "Wars of Liberation" had given to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> the first genuinely historical inspiration felt by a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>. These wars showed him that there was a corporate life, higher than that of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a>, of which the story might be told; and they offered to him as a subject the drama of the collision between East and West. With him, the spirit of history was born into <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>; and his work, called after the nine <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Muse?lang=en'>Muse</a>, was indeed the first utterance of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clio?lang=en'>Clio</a>.
<br>
<br>Relief of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean_Guillaume_Moitte?lang=en'>Jean_Guillaume_Moitte</a> (1806), <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louvre?lang=en'>Louvre</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris?lang=en'>Paris</a>
<br>Modern scholars generally turn to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>'s own writing for reliable information about his life,[26] supplemented with ancient yet much later sources, such as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Byzantium?lang=en'>Byzantium</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suda?lang=en'>Suda</a>, an 11th century <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Encyclopedia?lang=en'>Encyclopedia</a> which possibly took its information from traditional accounts.
<br>
<br>The data are so few – they rest upon such late and slight authority; they are so improbable or so contradictory, that to compile them into a biography is like building a house of cards, which the first breath of criticism will blow to the ground. Still, certain points may be approximately fixed ...
<br>
<br>Modern accounts of his life typically[28][29] go something like this: <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> was born at Halicarnassus around 484 BC. There is no reason to disbelieve the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suda?lang=en'>Suda</a>'s information about his family: that it was influential and that he was the son of Lyxes and Dryo, and the brother of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theodore_of_Mopsuestia?lang=en'>Theodore_of_Mopsuestia</a>, and that he was also related to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Panyassis?lang=en'>Panyassis</a> – an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epic_poetry?lang=en'>Epic_poetry</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poetry?lang=en'>Poetry</a> of the time. The town was within the Persian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire?lang=en'>Roman_Empire</a> at that time, making <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> subject,[30][31] and it may be that the young <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> heard local eye-witness accounts of events within the empire and of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> preparations for the invasion of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>, including the movements of the local fleet under the command of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artemisia_I_of_Caria?lang=en'>Artemisia_I_of_Caria</a> I of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caria?lang=en'>Caria</a>. Inscriptions recently discovered at Halicarnassus indicate that her grandson <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tugdamme?lang=en'>Tugdamme</a> negotiated with a local assembly to settle disputes over seized property, which is consistent with a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tyrant?lang=en'>Tyrant</a> under pressure. His name is not mentioned later in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tribute?lang=en'>Tribute</a> of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Delian_League</a>, indicating that there might well have been a successful uprising against him some time before 454 BC. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epic_poetry?lang=en'>Epic_poetry</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poetry?lang=en'>Poetry</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Panyassis?lang=en'>Panyassis</a> – a relative of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> – is reported to have taken part in a failed uprising. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> expresses affection for the island of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samos?lang=en'>Samos</a> (III, 39–60), and this is an indication that he might have lived there in his youth. So it is possible that his family was involved in an uprising against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tugdamme?lang=en'>Tugdamme</a>, leading to a period of exile on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samos?lang=en'>Samos</a> and followed by some personal hand in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tyrant?lang=en'>Tyrant</a>'s eventual fall.

<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> wrote his <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dialect?lang=en'>Dialect</a>, yet he was born in Halicarnassus, which was a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dorians?lang=en'>Dorians</a> settlement. According to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suda?lang=en'>Suda</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> learned the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dialect?lang=en'>Dialect</a> as a boy living on the island of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samos?lang=en'>Samos</a>, to which he had fled with his family from the oppressions of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tugdamme?lang=en'>Tugdamme</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tyrant?lang=en'>Tyrant</a> of Halicarnassus and grandson of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artemisia_I_of_Caria?lang=en'>Artemisia_I_of_Caria</a> I. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suda?lang=en'>Suda</a> also <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Institute_for_Operations_Research_and_the_Management_Sciences?lang=en'>Institute_for_Operations_Research_and_the_Management_Sciences</a> us that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> later returned home to lead the revolt that eventually overthrew the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tyrant?lang=en'>Tyrant</a>. Due to recent discoveries of inscriptions at Halicarnassus dated to about <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>'s time, we now know that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionic_Greek?lang=en'>Ionic_Greek</a> was used in Halicarnassus in some official documents, so there is no need to assume (like the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suda?lang=en'>Suda</a>) that he must have learned the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dialect?lang=en'>Dialect</a> elsewhere.[32] Further, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suda?lang=en'>Suda</a> is the only source which we have for the role played by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> as the heroic liberator of his birthplace. That itself is a good reason to doubt such a romantic account.[33]
<br>
<br>As <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> himself reveals, Halicarnassus, though a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dorians?lang=en'>Dorians</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a>, had ended its <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Close_Relations?lang=en'>Close_Relations</a> with its <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dorians?lang=en'>Dorians</a> neighbours after an unseemly quarrel (I, 144), and it had helped pioneer <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> trade with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a> (II, 178). It was, therefore, an outward-looking, international-minded port within the Persian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire?lang=en'>Roman_Empire</a>, and the historian's family could well have had contacts in other countries under <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> rule, facilitating his travels and his researches.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>'s eye-witness accounts indicate that he traveled in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a> in association with Athenians, probably some time after 454 BC or possibly earlier, after an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> fleet had assisted the uprising against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> rule in 460–454 BC. He probably traveled to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tire?lang=en'>Tire</a> next and then down the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Euphrates?lang=en'>Euphrates</a> to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon?lang=en'>Babylon</a>. For some reason, possibly associated with local politics, he subsequently found himself unpopular in Halicarnassus, and some time around 447 BC, migrated to Periclean <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> – a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> whose people and democratic institutions he openly admires (V, 78). <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> was also the place where he came to know the local topography (VI, 137; VIII, 52–5), as well as leading citizens such as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alcmaeonidae?lang=en'>Alcmaeonidae</a>, a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clan?lang=en'>Clan</a> whose history features frequently in his writing.
<br>
<br>According to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eusebius?lang=en'>Eusebius</a>[34] and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a>,[35] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> was granted a financial reward by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athenian_democracy?lang=en'>Athenian_democracy</a> in recognition of his work. It is possible that he unsuccessfully applied for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> citizenship, a rare honour after 451 BC, requiring two separate votes by a well-attended assembly.
<br>
<br>In 443 BC or shortly afterwards, he migrated to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thurii?lang=en'>Thurii</a> as part of an Athenian-sponsored <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colonies_in_antiquity?lang=en'>Colonies_in_antiquity</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle?lang=en'>Aristotle</a> refers to a version of The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> written by "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thurii?lang=en'>Thurii</a>", and some passages in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> have been interpreted as proof that he wrote about southern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Italy?lang=en'>Roman_Italy</a> from personal experience there (IV, 15,99; VI, 127). Intimate knowledge of some events in the first years of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_War</a> (VI, 91; VII, 133, 233; <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Final_Fantasy_IX?lang=en'>Final_Fantasy_IX</a>, 73) indicate that he might have returned to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, in which case it is possible that he died there during an outbreak of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bubonic_plague?lang=en'>Bubonic_plague</a>. Possibly he died in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Republic_of_Macedonia?lang=en'>Republic_of_Macedonia</a> instead, after obtaining the patronage of the court there; or else he died back in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thurii?lang=en'>Thurii</a>. There is nothing in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> that can be dated to later than 430 BC with any certainty, and it is generally assumed that he died not long afterwards, possibly before his <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/60th_United_States_Congress?lang=en'>60th_United_States_Congress</a> year.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> would have made his researches known to the larger world through oral recitations to a public crowd. John Marincola writes in his introduction to the Penguin edition of The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> that there are certain identifiable pieces in the early books of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>'s work which could be labeled as "performance pieces". These portions of the research seem independent and "almost detachable", so that they might have been set aside by the author for the purposes of an oral performance. The intellectual <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Composite_material?lang=en'>Composite_material</a> of the 5th century, Marincola suggests, comprised many oral performances in which philosophers would dramatically recite such detachable pieces of their work. The idea was to criticize previous arguments on a topic and emphatically and enthusiastically insert their own in order to win over the audience.[36]
<br>
<br>It was conventional in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>'s day for authors to "publish" their works by reciting them at popular festivals. According to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucian?lang=en'>Lucian</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> took his finished work straight from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a> to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Olympic_Games?lang=en'>Ancient_Olympic_Games</a> and read the entire <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> to the assembled spectators in one sitting, receiving rapturous applause at the end of it.[37] According to a very different account by an ancient <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grammar?lang=en'>Grammar</a>,[38] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> refused to begin reading his work at the festival of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opel_Olympia?lang=en'>Opel_Olympia</a> until some clouds offered him a bit of shade – by which time the assembly had dispersed. (Hence the proverbial <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Idiom?lang=en'>Idiom</a> "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> and his shade" to describe someone who misses an opportunity through delay.) <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>'s recitation at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opel_Olympia?lang=en'>Opel_Olympia</a> was a favourite theme among ancient writers, and there is another interesting variation on the story to be found in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suda?lang=en'>Suda</a>: that of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Photios_I_of_Constantinople?lang=en'>Photios_I_of_Constantinople</a>[39] and Tzetzes,[40] in which a young <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> happened to be in the assembly with his father, and burst into tears during the recital. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> observed prophetically to the boy's father, "Your son's <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul?lang=en'>Soul</a> yearns for knowledge."
<br>
<br>Eventually, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> became close enough for both to be interred in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>' tomb in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>. Such at least was the opinion of Marcellinus in his Life of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>.[41] According to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suda?lang=en'>Suda</a>, he was buried in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Macedonians?lang=en'>Ancient_Macedonians</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pella?lang=en'>Pella</a> and in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Agora?lang=en'>Agora</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thurii?lang=en'>Thurii</a>.[42]
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> were occasionally criticized in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>,[c] but modern historians and philosophers generally take a positive view.[43] Despite the controversy,[44][d] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> still serves as the primary, and often only, source for events in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> world, Persian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire?lang=en'>Roman_Empire</a>, and the region generally in the two centuries leading up until his own day.[17][46] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, like many ancient historians, preferred an element of show[e] to purely analytic history, aiming to give pleasure with "exciting events, great dramas, bizarre <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Exotica?lang=en'>Exotica</a>."[48] As such, certain passages[49][50] have been the subject of controversy and even some doubt, both in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> and today.[51][52][53][54][55][56][57][f]
<br>
<br>The accuracy of the works of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> has been controversial since his own era.[g] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cicero?lang=en'>Cicero</a>[h][59] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle?lang=en'>Aristotle</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Josephus?lang=en'>Josephus</a>, Duris of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samos?lang=en'>Samos</a>,[i][60] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harpocration?lang=en'>Harpocration</a>[j][61] and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> all commented on this controversy.[62][63] Generally, however, he was regarded as reliable in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>, and is especially so today. Many scholars, ancient and modern, routinely cite <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> (e.g., <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aubin_Codex?lang=en'>Aubin_Codex</a>, A. H. L. Heeren, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alan_Davidson_(cricketer,_born_1929)?lang=en'>Alan_Davidson_(cricketer,_born_1929)</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sheikh?lang=en'>Sheikh</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tapir?lang=en'>Tapir</a> Diop, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edgar_Allan_Poe?lang=en'>Edgar_Allan_Poe</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Welsby,_Queensland?lang=en'>Welsby,_Queensland</a>, Celenko, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constantin_François_de_Chassebœuf,_comte_de_Volney?lang=en'>Constantin_François_de_Chassebœuf,_comte_de_Volney</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Montet?lang=en'>Pierre_Montet</a>, Bernal, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jackson_Guitars?lang=en'>Jackson_Guitars</a>, DuBois, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strabo?lang=en'>Strabo</a>). Many of these scholars (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Welsby,_Queensland?lang=en'>Welsby,_Queensland</a>, Heeren, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aubin_Codex?lang=en'>Aubin_Codex</a>, Diop, etc.) explicitly mention the reliability of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>'s work[k] and demonstrate corroboration of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>'s writings by modern scholars.[l][64] A. H. L. Heeren quoted <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> throughout his work and provided corroboration by scholars regarding several passages (source of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nile?lang=en'>Nile</a>, location of Meroe, etc.).[65] To further his work on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aubin_Codex?lang=en'>Aubin_Codex</a> uses <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>'s accounts in various passages and defends <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>'s position. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aubin_Codex?lang=en'>Aubin_Codex</a> said that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> was "the author of the first important narrative history of the world".[66] Diop provides several examples (the inundations of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nile?lang=en'>Nile</a>) which, he argues, support his view that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> was "quite scrupulous, objective, scientific for his time." Diop argues that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> "always distinguishes carefully between what he has seen and what he has been told." Diop also notes that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strabo?lang=en'>Strabo</a> corroborated <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>'s ideas about the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Black_Sea?lang=en'>Black_Sea</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a>, Ethiopians, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colchis?lang=en'>Colchis</a>.[67][68]
<br>
<br>The reliability of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>' writing about <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a> is sometimes criticized.[57][m] Alan B. Lloyd argues that, as a historical document, the writings of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> are seriously defective, and that he was working from "inadequate sources".[51] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nielsen_ratings?lang=en'>Nielsen_ratings</a> writes: "Though we cannot entirely rule out the possibility of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> having been in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a>, it must be said that his narrative bears little witness to it."[52] German historian Detlev Fehling questions whether <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> ever traveled up the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nile?lang=en'>Nile</a> River, and considers doubtful almost everything that he says about <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aethiopia?lang=en'>Aethiopia</a>.[69][53] Fehling states that "there is not the slightest bit of history behind the whole story" about the claim of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pharaoh?lang=en'>Pharaoh</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sesostris?lang=en'>Sesostris</a> campaigned in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe?lang=en'>Europe</a>, and that he left a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colonies_in_antiquity?lang=en'>Colonies_in_antiquity</a> in Colchia.[55][54][n]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> provides much information about the nature of the world and the status of science during his lifetime, often engaging in private speculation. For example, he reports that the annual flooding of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nile?lang=en'>Nile</a> was said to be the result of melting snows far to the south, and he comments that he cannot understand how there can be <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Snow?lang=en'>Snow</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Africa?lang=en'>Africa</a>, the hottest part of the known world, offering an elaborate explanation based on the way that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Desert_Winds?lang=en'>Desert_Winds</a> affect the passage of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ra?lang=en'>Ra</a> over this part of the world (2:18ff). He also passes on reports from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phoenicia?lang=en'>Phoenicia</a> sailors that, while circumnavigating <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Africa?lang=en'>Africa</a>, they "saw the sun on the right side while sailing westwards". Owing to this brief mention, which is included almost as an afterthought, it has been argued that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Africa?lang=en'>Africa</a> was circumnavigated by ancient seafarers, for this is precisely where the sun ought to have been. His accounts of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_India?lang=en'>History_of_India</a> are among the oldest records of Indian civilization by an outsider.[70][71][72]
<br>
<br>Discoveries made since the end of the 19th century have generally added to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>'s credibility. He described <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gelonus?lang=en'>Gelonus</a>, located in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythia?lang=en'>Scythia</a>, as a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> thousands of times larger than <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Troy?lang=en'>Troy</a>; this was widely disbelieved until it was rediscovered in 1975. The archaeological study of the now-submerged ancient <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heracleion?lang=en'>Heracleion</a> and the recovery of the so-called "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naucratis?lang=en'>Naucratis</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stele?lang=en'>Stele</a>" give credibility to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>'s previously unsupported claim that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heracleion?lang=en'>Heracleion</a> was founded during the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_Kingdom_of_Egypt?lang=en'>New_Kingdom_of_Egypt</a>.
<br>
<br>After journeys to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_India?lang=en'>History_of_India</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pakistan?lang=en'>Pakistan</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_language?lang=en'>French_language</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ethnology?lang=en'>Ethnology</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michel_Peissel?lang=en'>Michel_Peissel</a> claimed to have discovered an animal <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Species?lang=en'>Species</a> that may illuminate one of the most bizarre passages in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>'s <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>.[73] In Book 3, passages 102 to 105, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> reports that a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Species?lang=en'>Species</a> of fox-sized, furry "ants" lives in one of the far eastern, Indian provinces of the Persian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire?lang=en'>Roman_Empire</a>. This region, he reports, is a sandy desert, and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sand?lang=en'>Sand</a> there contains a wealth of fine gold dust. These giant ants, according to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, would often <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Unearth?lang=en'>Unearth</a> the gold dust when digging their mounds and tunnels, and the people living in this province would then collect the precious dust. Peissel reports that, in an isolated region of northern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pakistan?lang=en'>Pakistan</a> on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deosai_National_Park?lang=en'>Deosai_National_Park</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gilgit-Baltistan?lang=en'>Gilgit-Baltistan</a> province, there is a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Species?lang=en'>Species</a> of marmot – the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Himalayan_marmot?lang=en'>Himalayan_marmot</a>, a type of burrowing squirrel – that may have been what <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> called giant ants. The ground of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deosai_National_Park?lang=en'>Deosai_National_Park</a> is rich in gold dust, much like the province that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> describes. According to Peissel, he interviewed the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brokpa?lang=en'>Brokpa</a> tribal people who live in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deosai_National_Park?lang=en'>Deosai_National_Park</a>, and they have confirmed that they have, for generations, been collecting the gold dust that the marmots bring to the surface when they are digging their underground burrows. Later authors such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pliny_the_Elder?lang=en'>Pliny_the_Elder</a> mentioned this story in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gold_mining?lang=en'>Gold_mining</a> section of his <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Natural_History_(Pliny)?lang=en'>Natural_History_(Pliny)</a>.

<br>Peissel offers the theory that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> may have confused the old <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> word for "marmot" with the word for "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mountain?lang=en'>Mountain</a> ant". Research suggests that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> probably did not know any <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> (or any other language except his native <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>) and was forced to rely on many local translators when travelling in the vast multilingual Persian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire?lang=en'>Roman_Empire</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> did not claim to have personally seen the creatures which he described.[73][74] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> did, though, follow up in passage 105 of Book 3 with the claim that the "ants" are said to chase and devour full-grown camels.
<br>
<br>Some "calumnious fictions" were written about <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> in a work titled On the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Cure?lang=en'>The_Cure</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a>, a Chaeronean by birth, (or it might have been a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pseudo-Plutarch?lang=en'>Pseudo-Plutarch</a>, in this case "a great collector of slanders"), including the allegation that the historian was prejudiced against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia?lang=en'>Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia</a> because the authorities there had denied him permission to set up a school.[75] Similarly, in a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a> Oration, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dio_Chrysostom?lang=en'>Dio_Chrysostom</a> (or yet another pseudonymous author) accused the historian of prejudice against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a>, sourcing it in personal bitterness over financial disappointments[76] – an account also given by Marcellinus in his Life of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>.[77] In fact, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> was in the habit of seeking out information from empowered sources within communities, such as aristocrats and priests, and this also occurred at an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_law?lang=en'>International_law</a> level, with Periclean <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> becoming his principal source of information about events in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>. As a result, his reports about <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> events are often coloured by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> bias against rival states – <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia?lang=en'>Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a> in particular.[78]
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> were sometimes criticized in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>,[o] but modern historians and philosophers take a more positive view of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>'s methodology, especially those searching for a paradigm of objective historical writing. A few modern scholars have argued that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> exaggerated the extent of his travels and invented his sources,[79] yet his reputation continues largely intact. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> is variously considered "father of comparative <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anthropology?lang=en'>Anthropology</a>",[17] "the father of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ethnography?lang=en'>Ethnography</a>",[46] and "more modern than any other <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_history?lang=en'>Ancient_history</a> in his approach to the ideal of total history".[43]
<br>
<br>It is clear from the beginning of Book 1 of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> utilizes (or at least claims to utilize) various sources in his narrative. K.H. Waters relates that "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> did not work from a purely <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> standpoint; he was accused by the patriotic but somewhat imperceptive <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> of being philobarbaros, a pro-barbarian or pro-foreigner."[80]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> at times relates various accounts of the same story. For example, in Book 1 he mentions both the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phoenicia?lang=en'>Phoenicia</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> accounts of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_locations_in_Babylon_5?lang=en'>List_of_locations_in_Babylon_5</a>.[81] However, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> at times arbitrates between varying accounts: "I am not going to say that these events happened one way or the other. Rather, I will point out the man who I know for a fact began the wrong-doing against the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>."[82] Again, later, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> claims himself as an authority: "I know this is how it happened because I heard it from the Delphians myself."[83]
<br>
<br>Throughout his work, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> attempts to explain the actions of people. Speaking about <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solon?lang=en'>Solon</a> the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> states "[<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solon?lang=en'>Solon</a>] sailed away on the pretext of seeing the world, but it was really so that he could not be compelled to repeal any of the laws he had laid down."[84] Again, in the story about <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Croesus?lang=en'>Croesus</a> and his son's death, when speaking of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adrastus?lang=en'>Adrastus</a> (the man who accidentally killed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Croesus?lang=en'>Croesus</a>' son), <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> states: "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adrastus?lang=en'>Adrastus</a> ... believing himself to be the most ill-fated man he had ever known, cut his own throat over the grave."[85]
<br>
<br>While <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> had not met these people whom he is discussing, he claims to understand their thoughts and intentions.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> writes with the purpose of explaining; that is, he discusses the reason for or cause of for an event. He lays this out in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Preface?lang=en'>Preface</a>: "This is the publication of the research of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> of Halicarnassus, so that the actions of people shall not fade with time, so that the great and admirable achievements of both <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> and barbarians shall not go unrenowned, and, among other things, to set forth the reasons why they waged war on each other."[86]
<br>
<br>This mode of explanation traces itself all the way back to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer?lang=en'>Homer</a>,[87] who opened the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iliad?lang=en'>Iliad</a> by asking:
<br>
<br>Which of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dungeons_&_Dragons_Immortals_Rules?lang=en'>Dungeons_&_Dragons_Immortals_Rules</a> these two at each other's throats?
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo?lang=en'>Apollo</a>,
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zeus?lang=en'>Zeus</a>’ son and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leto?lang=en'>Leto</a>’s, offended
<br>by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Warlord?lang=en'>Warlord</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Agamemnon?lang=en'>Agamemnon</a> had dishonored
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chryses?lang=en'>Chryses</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo?lang=en'>Apollo</a>'s <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clergy?lang=en'>Clergy</a>, so the god
<br>struck the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Jupiter_trojans_(Greek_camp)?lang=en'>List_of_Jupiter_trojans_(Greek_camp)</a> with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bubonic_plague?lang=en'>Bubonic_plague</a>,
<br>and the soldiers were dying of it.[88]
<br>Both <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer?lang=en'>Homer</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> begin with a question of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Causality?lang=en'>Causality</a>. In <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer?lang=en'>Homer</a>'s case, "who set these two at each other's throats?" In <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>'s case, "Why did the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> and barbarians go to war with each other?"
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>'s means of explanation does not necessarily posit a simple cause; rather, his explanations cover a host of potential causes and emotions. It is notable, however, that "the obligations of gratitude and revenge are the fundamental human motives for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, just as ... they are the primary stimulus to the generation of narrative itself."<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Effects_of_Hurricane_Sandy_in_New_York?lang=en'>Effects_of_Hurricane_Sandy_in_New_York</a>]
<br>
<br>Some readers of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> believe that his habit of tying events back to personal motives signifies an inability to see broader and more abstract reasons for action. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stephen_Jay_Gould?lang=en'>Stephen_Jay_Gould</a> argues to the contrary that this is likely because <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> attempts to provide the rational reasons, as understood by his contemporaries, rather than providing more abstract reasons.[90]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> attributes cause to both divine and human agents. These are not perceived as mutually exclusive, but rather mutually interconnected. This is true of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> thinking in general, at least from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer?lang=en'>Homer</a> onward.[91] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stephen_Jay_Gould?lang=en'>Stephen_Jay_Gould</a> notes that invoking the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supernatural?lang=en'>Supernatural</a> in order to explain an event does not answer the question "why did this happen?" but rather "why did this happen to me?" By way of example, faulty craftsmanship is the human cause for a house collapsing. However, divine will is the reason that the house collapses at the particular moment when I am inside. It was the will of the gods that the house collapsed while a particular individual was within it, whereas it was the cause of man that the house had a weak structure and was prone to falling.[92]
<br>
<br>Some authors, including Geoffrey de Ste-Croix and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mabel_Lang?lang=en'>Mabel_Lang</a>, have argued that Fate, or the belief that "this is how it had to be," is <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>'s ultimate understanding of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Causality?lang=en'>Causality</a>.[93] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>'s explanation that an event "was going to happen" maps well on to Aristotelean and Homeric means of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Idiom?lang=en'>Idiom</a>. The idea of "it was going to happen" reveals a "tragic discovery" associated with fifth-century drama. This tragic discovery can be seen in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer?lang=en'>Homer</a>'s, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iliad?lang=en'>Iliad</a> as well.[94]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Gould?lang=en'>John_Gould</a> argues that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> should be understood as falling in a long line of story-tellers, rather than thinking of his means of explanation as a "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greek_philosophy?lang=en'>Ancient_Greek_philosophy</a> of history" or "simple <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Causality?lang=en'>Causality</a>". Thus, according to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stephen_Jay_Gould?lang=en'>Stephen_Jay_Gould</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>'s means of explanation is a mode of story-telling and narration that has been passed down from generations prior:[95]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>' sense of what was 'going to happen' is not the language of one who holds a theory of historical necessity, who sees the whole of human experience as constrained by inevitability and without room for human choice or human responsibility, diminished and belittled by forces too large for comprehension or resistance; it is rather the traditional language of a teller of tales whose tale is structured by his awareness of the shape it must have and who presents human experience on the model of the narrative patterns that are built into his stories; the narrative <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Action_potential?lang=en'>Action_potential</a> itself, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Action_potential?lang=en'>Action_potential</a> towards 'closure' and the sense of an ending, is retrojected to become 'explanation'.[96]
<br>
<br>Although <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> considered his "inquiries" a serious pursuit of knowledge, he was not above relating entertaining tales derived from the collective body of myth, but he did so judiciously with regard for his <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Historical_method?lang=en'>Historical_method</a>, by corroborating the stories through enquiry and testing their <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Probability?lang=en'>Probability</a>.[97] While the gods never make personal appearances in his account of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_Events?lang=en'>Human_Events</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> states emphatically that "many things prove to me that the gods take part in the affairs of man" (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Final_Fantasy_IX?lang=en'>Final_Fantasy_IX</a>, 100).
<br>
<br>In Book One, passages 23 and 24, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> relates the story of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arion?lang=en'>Arion</a>, the renowned <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harp?lang=en'>Harp</a> player, "second to no man living at that time," who was saved by a dolphin. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> prefaces the story by noting that "a very wonderful thing is said to have happened," and alleges its veracity by adding that the "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Corinth?lang=en'>Ancient_Corinth</a> and the Lesbians agree in their account of the matter." Having become very rich while at the court of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Periander?lang=en'>Periander</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arion?lang=en'>Arion</a> conceived a desire to sail to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Italy?lang=en'>Roman_Italy</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily?lang=en'>Sicily</a>. He hired a vessel crewed by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Corinth?lang=en'>Ancient_Corinth</a>, whom he felt he could <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trust_law?lang=en'>Trust_law</a>, but the sailors plotted to throw him overboard and seize his wealth. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arion?lang=en'>Arion</a> discovered the plot and begged for his life, but the crew gave him two options: that either he kill himself on the spot or jump ship and fend for himself in the sea. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arion?lang=en'>Arion</a> flung himself into the water, and a dolphin carried him to shore.[98]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> clearly writes as both historian and teller of tales. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> takes a fluid position between the artistic story-weaving of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer?lang=en'>Homer</a> and the rational data-accounting of later historians. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Herrington?lang=en'>John_Herrington</a> has developed a helpful <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metaphor?lang=en'>Metaphor</a> for describing <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>'s dynamic position in the history of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Art_of_Europe?lang=en'>Art_of_Europe</a> and thought – <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Centaur?lang=en'>Centaur</a>:
<br>
<br>The human forepart of the animal ... is the urbane and responsible <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_antiquity?lang=en'>Classical_antiquity</a> historian; the body indissolubly united to it is something out of the faraway mountains, out of an older, freer and wilder realm where our conventions have no force.[99]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> is neither a mere gatherer of data nor a simple teller of tales – he is both. While <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> is certainly concerned with giving accurate accounts of events, this does not preclude for him the insertion of powerful mythological elements into his narrative, elements which will aid him in expressing the truth of matters under his study. Thus to understand what <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> is doing in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, we must not impose strict demarcations between the man as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mythology?lang=en'>Mythology</a> and the man as historian, or between the work as myth and the work as history. As <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_VI_and_I?lang=en'>James_VI_and_I</a> Romm has written, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> worked under a common <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> cultural assumption that the way events are remembered and retold (e.g. in myths or legends) produces a valid kind of understanding, even when this retelling is not entirely factual.[100] For <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>
