<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ancient Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> civilization, the period following <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycenaean civilization</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mycenaean_Greece</b></span>, which ended about 1200 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, to the death of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span>, in 323 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. It was a period of political, philosophical, artistic, and scientific achievements that formed a legacy with unparalleled influence on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Western civilization</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Western_culture</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The period between the catastrophic end of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycenaean civilization</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mycenaean_Greece</b></span> and about 900 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> is often called a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dark Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_Dark_Ages</b></span>. It was a time about which <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> of the Classical age had confused and actually false notions. <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>, the great <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ancient historian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_history</b></span> of the 5th century <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, wrote a sketch of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> history from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Trojan War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Trojan_War</b></span> to his own day, in which he notoriously fails, in the appropriate chapter, to signal any kind of dramatic rupture. (He does, however, speak of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> settling down gradually and colonizing <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Italy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Italian_Peninsula</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicily</b></span>, and what is now western <span style='color: blue'><b>Turkey</b></span>. This surely implies that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> was settling down after something.) <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> does indeed display sound knowledge of the series of migrations by which <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> was resettled in the post-Mycenaean period. The most famous of these was the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dorian invasion</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dorian_invasion</b></span>, which the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> called, or connected with, the legendary return of the descendants of <span style='color: blue'><b>Heracles</b></span>. Although much about that invasion is problematic—it left little or no archaeological trace at the point in time where tradition puts it—the problems are of no concern here. Important for the understanding of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Archaic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archaic_Greece</b></span> and Classical periods, however, is the powerful belief in Dorianism as a linguistic and religious concept. <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> casually but significantly mentions soldiers speaking the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Doric dialect</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Doric_Greek</b></span> in a narrative about ordinary military matters in the year 426. That is a surprisingly abstract way of looking at the subdivisions of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, because it would have been more natural for a 5th-century <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> to identify soldiers by home cities. Equally important to the understanding of this period is the hostility to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dorians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Doric_Greek</b></span>, usually on the part of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionic_Greek</b></span>, another linguistic and religious <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>subgroup</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Subgroup</b></span>, whose most-famous <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> was <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>. So extreme was this hostility that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dorians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Doric_Greek</b></span> were prohibited from entering <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionic_Greek</b></span> sanctuaries; extant today is a 5th-century example of such a prohibition, an inscription from the island of <span style='color: blue'><b>Paros</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Phenomena such as the tension between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dorians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Doric_Greek</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionic_Greek</b></span> that have their origins in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dark Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_Dark_Ages</b></span> are a reminder that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> civilization did not emerge either unannounced or uncontaminated by what had gone before. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Dark Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Dark_Age_(Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer)</b></span> itself is beyond the scope of this article. One is bound to notice, however, that archaeological finds tend to call into question the whole concept of a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dark Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_Dark_Ages</b></span> by showing that certain features of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> civilization once thought not to antedate about 800 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> can actually be pushed back by as much as two centuries. One example, chosen for its relevance to the emergence of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city-state</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Polis</b></span>, or polis, will suffice. In 1981 archaeology pulled back the curtain on the darkest phase of all, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Protogeometric Period</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Protogeometric_style</b></span> (c. 1075–900 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>), which takes its name from the geometric shapes painted on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pottery</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pottery</b></span>. A grave, rich by the standards of any period, was uncovered at a site called <span style='color: blue'><b>Lefkandi</b></span> on <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span>, the island along the eastern flank of <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span> (the territory controlled by <span style='color: blue'><b>Athens</b></span>). <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The grave</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Grave_(poem)</b></span>, which dates to about 1000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, contains the (probably cremated) remains of a man and a woman. The large bronze vessel in which the man’s ashes were deposited came from <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyprus</b></span>, and the gold items buried with the woman are splendid and sophisticated in their workmanship. Remains of horses were found as well; the animals had been buried with their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>snaffle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Snaffle_bit</b></span> bits. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The grave</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Grave_(poem)</b></span> was within a large collapsed house, whose form anticipates that of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_language</b></span> temples two centuries later. Previously it had been thought that those temples were one of the first manifestations of the monumentalizing associated with the beginnings of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city-state</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Polis</b></span>. Thus, that find and those made in a set of nearby cemeteries in the years before 1980 attesting further contacts between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyprus</b></span> between 1000 and 800 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> are important evidence. They show that one corner of one island of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, at least, was neither impoverished nor isolated in a period usually thought to have been both. The difficulty is to know just how exceptional <span style='color: blue'><b>Lefkandi</b></span> was, but in any view it has revised former ideas about what was and what was not possible at the beginning of the 1st millennium <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The term colonization, although it may be convenient and widely used, is misleading. When applied to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Archaic Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archaic_Greece</b></span>, it should not necessarily be taken to imply the state-sponsored sending out of definite numbers of settlers, as the later Roman origin of the word implies. For one thing, it will be seen that state formation may itself be a product of the colonizing movement.
<br>
<br>The first date in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> history is <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>776 BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>776_BC</b></span>, the year of the first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympic Games</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Olympic_Games</b></span>. It was computed by a 5th-century-BCE researcher called <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span>. He was originally from <span style='color: blue'><b>Elis</b></span>, a place in the western <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span> in whose territory <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Opel_Olympia</b></span> itself is situated. This date and the list of early victors, transmitted by another literary tradition, are likely to be reliable, if only because the list is so unassuming in its early reaches. That is to say, local victors predominate, including some <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Messenians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Messene</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Messene</b></span> lost its independence to neighbouring <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> during the course of the 8th century, and this fact is an additional guarantee of the reliability of the early Olympic victor list: Messenian victors would hardly have been invented at a time when <span style='color: blue'><b>Messene</b></span> as a political entity had ceased to exist. Clearly, then, record keeping and organized activity involving more than one community and centring on a sanctuary, such as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Opel_Olympia</b></span>, go back to the early 8th century. (Such competitive activity is an example of what has been called peer-polity interaction.) Records imply a degree of literacy, and there too the tradition about the 8th century has been confirmed by late 20th-century finds. A cup, bearing the inscription in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_language</b></span> in the Euboean script I am the cup of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Nestor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nestor_the_Chronicler</b></span>, can be securely dated to before 700 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. It was found at an island site called <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pithekoussai</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ischia</b></span> (<span style='color: blue'><b>Ischia</b></span>) on the Bay of <span style='color: blue'><b>Naples</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The early overseas activity of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Euboeans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Euboea</b></span> has already been remarked upon in connection with the discoveries at <span style='color: blue'><b>Lefkandi</b></span>. They were the prime movers in the more or less organized—or, at any rate, remembered and recorded—phase of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_language</b></span> overseas settlement, a process known as colonization. (Euboean priority can be taken as absolutely certain because archaeology supports the literary tradition of the Roman historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Livy</b></span> and others: Euboean <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pottery</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pottery_of_ancient_Greece</b></span> has been found both at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pithekoussai</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ischia</b></span> to the west and at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Turkish</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Turkish_language</b></span> site of <span style='color: blue'><b>Al-Mina</b></span> to the east.) This more-organized phase began in <span style='color: blue'><b>Italy</b></span> about 750 and in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicily</b></span> in 734 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>; its episodes were remembered, perhaps in writing, by the colonies themselves. The word organized needs to be stressed, because various considerations make it necessary to push back beyond that date the beginning of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> colonization. First, it is clear from archaeological finds, such as the <span style='color: blue'><b>Lefkandi</b></span> material, and from other new evidence that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> had already, before 750 or 734, confronted and exchanged goods with the inhabitants of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Italy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Italian_Peninsula</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicily</b></span>. Second, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> says that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dark Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_Dark_Ages</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> sent colonies to <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>, and archaeology bears this out—however much one discounts for propagandist exaggeration by the imperial <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>’ own time of its <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>prehistoric</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Prehistory</b></span> colonizing role. However, after the founding of <span style='color: blue'><b>Cumae</b></span> (a mainland <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Italian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Italian_language</b></span> offshoot of the island settlement of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pithekoussai</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ischia</b></span>) about 750 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> and of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sicilian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sicily</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span> and Syracuse in 734 and 733, respectively, there was an explosion of colonies to all points of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>compass</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Compass</b></span>. The only exceptions were those areas, such as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pharaonic Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> or inner <span style='color: blue'><b>Anatolia</b></span>, where the inhabitants were too militarily and politically advanced to be easily overrun.
<br>
<br>One may ask why the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> suddenly began to launch these overseas projects. It seems that commercial interests, greed, and sheer curiosity were the motivating forces. An older view, according to which <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Archaic Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archaic_Greece</b></span> exported its surplus population because of an uncontrollable rise in population, must be regarded as largely discredited. In the first place, the earliest well-documented colonial operations were small-scale affairs, too small to make much difference to the situation of the sending community (the metropolis, or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mother city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mother_City_F.C.</b></span>). That is certainly true of the colonization of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrene</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrenaica</b></span>, in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>North Africa</span> <span style='color: green'><b>North_Africa</b></span>, from the island of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thera</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Santorini</b></span> (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Santorin</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Santorini</b></span>); on this point, an inscription has confirmed the classic account by the 5th-century <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>. In the second place, population was not uncontrollable in principle: artificial means such as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>infanticide</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Infanticide</b></span> were available, not to mention more-modern techniques like <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>contraception</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Birth_control</b></span>. Considerations of this kind much reduce the evidential value of discoveries establishing, for example, that the number of graves in <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Argolid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Argolis</b></span> (the area round <span style='color: blue'><b>Argos</b></span>) increased dramatically in the later <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dark Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_Dark_Ages</b></span> or that there was a serious <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>drought</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Drought</b></span> in 8th-century <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span> (that is the admitted implication of a number of dried-up wells in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian agora</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Agora_of_Athens</b></span>, or civic centre). In fact, no single explanation for the colonizing activity is plausible. Political difficulties at home might sometimes be a factor, as, for instance, at <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, which in the 8th century sent out a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>colony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Colonies_in_antiquity</b></span> to Taras (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tarentum</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Taranto</b></span>) in <span style='color: blue'><b>Italy</b></span> as a way of getting rid of an unwanted <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>half-caste</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mestizo</b></span> group. Nor can one rule out simple craving for excitement and a desire to see the world. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>lyric poetry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lyric_poetry</b></span> of the energetic and high-strung <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>poet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Poetry</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Archilochus</b></span>, a 7th-century Parian involved in the colonization of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thasos</b></span>, shows the kind of lively minded individual who might be involved in the colonizing movement.
<br>
<br>So far, the vague term community has been used for places that sent out colonies. Such <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vagueness</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vagueness</b></span> is historically appropriate, because those places themselves were scarcely constituted as united entities, such as a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>, or polis. For example, it is a curious fact that <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span>, which in 733 colonized <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Syracuse</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Syracuse_University</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicily</b></span>, was itself scarcely a properly constituted polis in 733. (The formation of <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> as a united entity is to be put in the second half of the 8th century, with precisely the colonization of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Syracuse</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Syracuse_University</b></span> as its first collective act.)
<br>
<br>The name given to polis formation by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> themselves was <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>synoikismos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Synoecism</b></span>, literally a gathering together. Synoikismos could take one or both of two forms—it could be a physical concentration of the population in a single <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> or an act of purely political unification that allowed the population to continue living in a dispersed way. The classic discussion is by <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>, who distinguishes between the two kinds of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>synoikismos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Synoecism</b></span> more carefully than do some of his modern critics. He makes the correct point that <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span> was politically <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>synoecized</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Synoecism</b></span> at an early date but not physically <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>synoecized</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Synoecism</b></span> until 431 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> when <span style='color: blue'><b>Pericles</b></span> as part of his war policy brought the large rural population behind the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> walls of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>. A more extreme instance of a polis that was never fully <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>synoecized</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Synoecism</b></span> in the physical sense was <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, which, as <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> elsewhere says, remained settled by villages in the old <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> way. It was an act of conscious arrogance, a way of claiming to be invulnerable from attack and not to need the walls that <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> again and again treats as the sign and guarantee of civilized polis life. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>urban history</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Urban_history</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> makes an interesting case history showing that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycenaean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mycenaean_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> was not so physically or psychologically secure as its <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and Roman successors. The administrative centre of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycenaean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mycenaean_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> was probably in the Párnon Mountains at the excavated site of the Menelaion. Then <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Archaic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archaic_Greece</b></span> and Classical <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> moved down to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Plain</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Byzantine</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Byzantine_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, more insecure, moved out of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Plain</b></span> again to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>perch</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Perch</b></span> on the site of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mistra</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mystras</b></span> on the opposite western <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mountain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mountain</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Taygetos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Taygetus</b></span>. Finally, modern <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> is situated, once again peacefully and confidently, on its old site on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Plain</b></span> of the river <span style='color: blue'><b>Eurotas</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The enabling factors behind the beginnings of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_language</b></span> polis have been the subject of intense discussion. One approach connects the beginnings of the polis with the first monumental buildings, usually temples like the great early 8th-century <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_temple</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Hera</b></span> on the island of <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span>. The concentration of resources and effort required for such constructions presupposes the formation of self-conscious polis units and may actually have accelerated it. As stated above, however, the evidence from <span style='color: blue'><b>Lefkandi</b></span> makes it hard to see the construction of such monumental buildings as a sufficient cause for the emergence of the polis, a process or event nobody has yet tried to date as early as 1000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Another related theory argues that the birth of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> was signaled by the placing of rural sanctuaries at the margins of the territory that a community sought to define as its own. That theory fits admirably a number of Peloponnesian sanctuaries; for instance, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_temple</b></span> complex of <span style='color: blue'><b>Hera</b></span> staked out a claim, on the part of relatively distant <span style='color: blue'><b>Argos</b></span>, to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Plain</b></span> stretching between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> and sanctuary, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corinth</b></span> sanctuary on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>promontory</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Promontory</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Perachora</b></span>, also dedicated to <span style='color: blue'><b>Hera</b></span>, performed the same function. Yet there are difficulties. It seems that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Isthmia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Isthmus_of_Corinth</b></span> sanctuary, which at first sight seems a good candidate for another <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corinth</b></span> rural sanctuary, was already operational as early as 900 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Protogeometric Period</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Protogeometric_style</b></span>, and that date is surely too early for polis formation. Nor does the theory easily account for the rural <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_temple</b></span> of the goddess <span style='color: blue'><b>Aphaea</b></span> in the middle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span>. The sanctuary is admittedly a long way from the town of <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span>, but <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span> is an island, and there is no obvious neighbour against whom territorial claims could plausibly have been asserted. Finally, a theory that has to treat the best-known polis—namely, Athens—and <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span> as in every respect exceptional is not satisfactory: there is no <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> equivalent of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Argive Heraeum</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Heraion_of_Argos</b></span>.
<br>
<br>A third theory attacks the problem of the beginnings of the polis through burial practice. In the 8th century (it is said) formal burial became more generally available, and that democratization of burial is evidence for a fundamentally new attitude toward society. The theory seeks to associate the new attitude with the growth of the polis. There is, however, insufficient archaeological and historical evidence for that view (which involves an implausible hypothesis that the process postulated was discontinuous and actually reversed for a brief period at a date later than the 8th century). Moreover, it is vulnerable to the converse objection as that raised against the second theory: the evidence for the third theory is almost exclusively <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Attic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Attica</b></span>, and so, even if it were true, it would explain <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and only <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Fourth, one may consider a theory whose unspoken premise is a kind of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>geographic determinism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Environmental_determinism</b></span>. Perhaps the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> landscape itself, with its small <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>alluvial</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alluvial_plain</b></span> plains often surrounded by defensible <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mountain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mountain</b></span> systems, somehow prompted the formation of small and acrimonious <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>poleis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Polis</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>endlessly</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Endlessly_(album)</b></span> going to war over boundaries. That view has its attractions, but the obvious objection is that, when <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> went to more-open areas such as Italy, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicily</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>North Africa</span> <span style='color: green'><b>North_Africa</b></span>, they seem to have taken their animosities with them. That in turn invites speculations of a psychologically <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>determinist</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Determinism</b></span> sort; one has to ask, without hope of an answer, whether the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> were naturally particularist.
<br>
<br>A fifth enabling factor that should be borne in mind is the influence of the colonizing movement itself. The political structure of the metropolis, or sending <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>, may sometimes have been inchoate. The new <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>colony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Colonies_in_antiquity</b></span>, however, threatened by hostile native neighbours, rapidly had to get its act together if it was to be a viable cell of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hellenistic_period</b></span> on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>foreign soil</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Foreign_Soil</b></span>. That effort in turn affected the situation in the metropolis, because <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek colonies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Colonies_in_antiquity</b></span> often kept close religious and social links with it. A 4th-century inscription, for instance, attests close ties between <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> and its daughter <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Olbia</b></span> in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Black</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Black_Sea</b></span> region. Here, however, as so often in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> history, generalization is dangerous; some mother-daughter relationships, like that between <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corcyra</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corfu</b></span> (<span style='color: blue'><b>Corfu</b></span>), were bad virtually from the start.
<br>
<br>A related factor is <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenician</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span> influence (related, because the early <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenicians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span> were great colonizers, who must often have met trading <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>). The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenician</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span> coast was settled by communities similar in many respects to the early <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>poleis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Polis</b></span>. It is arguable that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenician</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span> influence, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Semitic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenician_alphabet</b></span> influence generally, on early <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> has been seriously underrated.
<br>
<br>Theories such as these are stimulating and may each contain a particle of truth. The better position, however, is that generalization itself is as yet premature; in particular, archaeologically based theoretical reconstructions need much more refining. All one can say in summary is that in roughly the same period—namely, the 8th century—a number of areas, such as <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Megara</b></span>, began to define their borders, deny autonomy to their constituent villages, and generally act as separate states. <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>’s political <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>synoecism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Synoecism</b></span>, which occurred a little earlier, was complete perhaps about 900. Tempting though it is to seek a single explanatory model for those very roughly contemporaneous processes, one should perhaps allow that different paths of development were followed in different areas, even in areas next door to each other. After all, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Archaic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archaic_Greece</b></span> and Classical histories of mighty democratic imperial <span style='color: blue'><b>Athens</b></span>, of the miserable polis of <span style='color: blue'><b>Megara</b></span> which nevertheless colonized <span style='color: blue'><b>Byzantium</b></span>, of wealthy, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oligarchic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Oligarchy</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinth</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Corinth</b></span>, and of federal <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span> were all very different even though <span style='color: blue'><b>Athens</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Megara</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinth</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Corinth</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span> were close neighbours.
<br>
<br>One is perhaps on firmer ground when one examines the evidence for prepolis aggregations of larger units, often religious in character. There are a number of such associations whose origins lie in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dark Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_Dark_Ages</b></span> and whose existence surely promoted some feeling of local and particularist identity among the participants. The <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Anatolia</b></span> formed themselves into a confederation of 12 communities, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionians</b></span> Dodecapolis, with a common meeting place; and there were comparable groupings among the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dorian Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dorians</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Anatolia</b></span> and even among the <span style='color: blue'><b>Carians</b></span> (partially <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenized</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> non-Greeks) in the same part of the world. The central location for such organizations was characteristically small and insignificant. One poorly attested but intriguing early <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Archaic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archaic_Greece</b></span> league was the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Calaurian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kalaureia</b></span> Amphictyony (an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>amphictyony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Amphictyonic_League</b></span> was a religious league of dwellers round about). <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Calauria</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kalaureia</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>small island</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Small_Island_(TV_film)</b></span> now called Póros, was not a place of any consequence in itself, but the league’s seven members included <span style='color: blue'><b>Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span>, two major <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>poleis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Polis</b></span>. The most famous and enduring such <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>amphictyony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Amphictyonic_League</b></span>, however, was the one that, originally from a distance, administered the affairs of the sanctuary of <span style='color: blue'><b>Delphi</b></span> in central <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. That sanctuary contained the most-famous, though not the oldest, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oracle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delphi</b></span> (the oldest was at <span style='color: blue'><b>Dodona</b></span>); oracles were a mechanism by which divinely inspired utterances were produced in answer to specific questions. Finally, it is worth noting an adventurous suggestion that <span style='color: blue'><b>Lefkandi</b></span> itself might have been the centre of some kind of religious <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>amphictyony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Amphictyonic_League</b></span>, but, if so, this would be an exception to the principle that religious centres tended themselves to be insignificant, however mighty their participating members.
<br>
<br>Before attempting to characterize <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Archaic Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archaic_Greece</b></span>, one must admit candidly that the evidence is unsatisfactory. Only for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> is anything like a proper political tradition known, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>’s development toward the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span> of the 5th century was amazingly and untypically rapid by comparison with other states, many of which never became democratic at all. A tiny but salutary scrap of evidence makes this point: <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> in Book II of his History of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> casually mentions a man called Evarchus as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> of a small northwestern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> polis called <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Astacus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nicomedia</b></span> in the 420s <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. But for this chance mention, one would never have guessed that tyranny could have existed or persisted in such a place so late or so long. Another difficulty is that, while a fair amount about the social structure of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Classical Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Greece</b></span> is known, some of it must go back to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Archaic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archaic_Greece</b></span> times; just how much is disputed.
<br>
<br>There is a further complication. In both the political and the social spheres, one has to reckon—chiefly at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, but elsewhere too—with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>invented tradition</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Invented_tradition</b></span>, a distorting element for which proper allowance is only now beginning to be made. Thus, it seems that not just <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lycurgus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lycurgus_of_Sparta</b></span>, the famous Spartan lawgiver (whose historicity was doubted even in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>antiquity</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>), but even a reforming figure like <span style='color: blue'><b>Solon</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, who certainly existed in the 6th century and large fragments of whose poetry still survive, was in some respects what anthropologists call a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>culture hero</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Culture_hero</b></span>. Much was projected onto him anachronistically or just wrongly, and reformers in later generations established their credentials by claiming (if they were reactionaries) that they were trying to get back to <span style='color: blue'><b>Solon</b></span> or (if they were democrats) that <span style='color: blue'><b>Solon</b></span> was their founding father. Such errors should not induce too much pessimism: at Athens at least, individual aristocratic families preserved oral traditions, which affected the later literary records in ways that can be properly understood with the help of anthropological analogy. That is to say, not all the evidence so preserved is unusable, but it needs handling in special ways.
<br>
<br>It has even been argued that social life too was creatively manipulated. Later <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_language</b></span> cities contained, alongside such transparent political institutions as the Popular Assembly and the Deliberative (Probouleutic) Council, a more-opaque set of institutions, ostensibly based on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>kinship</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kinship</b></span> groupings. The biggest and most basic of these groupings were the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phyle</b></span>, or tribes, according to which the citizen body was subdivided. Thus, all <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dorian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dorians</b></span> states had the same three tribes, and there were four <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionians</b></span> tribes (although <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionians</b></span> states were less conservative than <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dorian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dorians</b></span>, and one finds among them a greater readiness to innovate; late 6th-century Athens, for example, switched from a four-tribe hereditary system of citizenship to a 10-tribe one based on simple residence as well as descent). Smaller subdivisions were the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phratry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phratry</b></span>, a word connected with a philological <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>root</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Proto-Indo-European_root</b></span> meaning brother, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>genos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Genos</b></span>, a smaller cluster of families (oikoi).
<br>
<br>The existence of these groupings in historical times is beyond question; one finds them controlling citizen intake (as in the so-called Demotionidai inscription from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Attic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Attica</b></span> village of <span style='color: blue'><b>Decelea</b></span>, datable to as late as the early 4th century <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>) and entering into complicated property arrangements. What has become a matter of debate, however, is the question of just how old they actually were. According to the most-skeptical view, the whole apparatus of tribe and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>genos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Genos</b></span> was an invention without any <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dark Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_Dark_Ages</b></span> history to legitimate it. This view, which rests partly on the near absence of the relevant <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>kinship terminology</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kinship_terminology</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Homer</b></span>, is not ultimately convincing in its hypothesis of a kind of complicated collective fraud on posterity. Yet it is right to allow for an element of conscious antiquarianism at certain periods (the 320s in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> being one), which may well have affected specific traditions.
<br>Society and values
<br>
<br>The world of the colonizing states was aristocratic in the sense that a small number of exclusive clans within cities monopolized citizenship and political control. At <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span>, for example, political control was monopolized by the adult males of a single <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>clan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Clan</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue'><b>Bacchiadae</b></span>. They perhaps numbered no more than a couple of hundred. At <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> there was a general class of <span style='color: blue'><b>Eupatridae</b></span>, a word that just means people of good descent—i.e., aristocrats. (The word may have had a simultaneous but narrower application to one single <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>genos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Genos</b></span>. This, however, is disputed, and, in any event, that hypothetical family was only one among many privileged genē. The case, therefore, is not analogous to that of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Bacchiadae</b></span>.) It is unlikely that the <span style='color: blue'><b>Eupatridae</b></span> were as rigidly defined as the <span style='color: blue'><b>Bacchiadae</b></span>, and the negative tradition that <span style='color: blue'><b>Solon</b></span> in the early 6th century deprived them of their exclusive claim to political office may just be the excessively formal and precise way in which later ancient commentators described a positive change by which power was made more generally available than it had been before.
<br>
<br>With regard to those same early <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Archaic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archaic_Greece</b></span> times, one hears—for example, in the poetry of the 7th-century Boeotian Hesiod—of control, sometimes oppressively exercised, by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>basileis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Basileus</b></span> (singular <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>basileus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Basileus</b></span>). That word is usually translated as kings, and such titles as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>basileus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Basileus</b></span> (an official, or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>archon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Eponymous_archon</b></span>, with a defined religious competence, conveniently but less correctly called the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>archon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Eponymous_archon</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>basileus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Basileus</b></span> by modern scholars) are then explained as survivals of an age of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>monarchy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Monarchy</b></span>. That account in terms of fossilization certainly eases the awkwardness of explaining why, for instance, the wife of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>archon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Eponymous_archon</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>basileus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Basileus</b></span> was held to be ritually married to the god <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dionysus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus</b></span>. The very existence of kingship in Geometric (as opposed to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycenaean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mycenaean_Greece</b></span>) <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, however, has been challenged, and a case has been made (though not universally accepted) for seeing most of those <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Archaic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archaic_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>basileis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Basileus</b></span> not as kings in any sense but as hereditary nobles. In the latter case, there is no great difference between those <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>basileis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Basileus</b></span> and such aristocrats as the <span style='color: blue'><b>Bacchiadae</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Life inside the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Archaic Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archaic_Greece</b></span> societies ruled by such families can be reconstructed only impressionistically and only at the top of the social scale; the evidence, to an extent unusual even in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Roman</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_art</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>antiquity</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_antiquity</b></span>, is essentially elitist in its bias. Aristocratic values were transmitted both vertically, by family oral traditions, and horizontally, by means of a crucial institution known as the symposium, or feast, for which (many literary scholars now believe) much surviving <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Archaic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archaic_Greece</b></span> poetry was originally written. Perhaps much fine painted pottery was also intended for that market, though the social and artistic significance of such pottery is debated. Some scholars insist that the really wealthy would at all times have used gold and silver vessels, which, however, have not survived in any numbers because they were melted down long ago.
<br>
<br>Symposia were eating and dining occasions with a strong ritual element; their existence is reflected in the marked emphasis, in the Homeric poems, on ostentatious feasting and formal banqueting as assertions of status (what have been called feasts of merit). Thus, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sarpedon</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Homer</b></span>’s <span style='color: blue'><b>Iliad</b></span> reminds <span style='color: blue'><b>Glaucus</b></span> that both of them are honoured with seats of honour and full cups in <span style='color: blue'><b>Lycia</b></span> and with land (a sacred precinct, or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temenos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Temenos</b></span>) to finance all the feasting. Symposia were confined to males (a reminder of the military ethos so prevalent in <span style='color: blue'><b>Homer</b></span>); although when the institution was introduced, along with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vine</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vine</b></span>, to Etruria—where much of the visual evidence comes from—it changed its character and became open to both sexes. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> symposium proper can be seen as an instrument of social control; it is a more-tangible unit of social organization, and one with better-attested Homeric antecedents, than the problematic genē or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phratries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phratry</b></span> discussed above.
<br>
<br>In Classical times, strong <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>homosexual</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Homosexuality</b></span> attachments were another way in which values were inculcated, passed on by the older man (the erastes) to the younger <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>eromenos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pederasty_in_ancient_Greece</b></span>, or beloved. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>gymnasium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gym</b></span> was the venue where such relationships typically developed. As with the symposium, there was an almost ritual element to it all; certain gifts—such as, for example, the gift of a hare—were thought especially appropriate. The date, however, at which <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek homosexuality</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_Homosexuality_(book)</b></span> became a central cultural institution is problematic; it is notoriously absent from the Homeric poems, a fact that some scholars explain as being the result of poetic reticence. The more-plausible view is that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>homosexuality</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Homosexuality</b></span> was in some way connected with the rise of the polis and was part of what has been called the 8th-century renaissance. If so, <span style='color: blue'><b>Homer</b></span>’s silence is after all significant: he does not mention it because in his time it was not yet important.
<br>
<br>Both symposia and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>gymnasia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gym</b></span> in different ways mirrored or were preparatory to warfare (see below). <span style='color: blue'><b>Interpolis</b></span> athletic competitions (such as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympic Games</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Olympic_Games</b></span>) are another reflection of warfare. Epinician poetry of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Classical period</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Greece</b></span> (that is, victory poetry like that of <span style='color: blue'><b>Pindar</b></span>, whose epinician odes celebrate the athletic victories of aristocratic individuals) constantly uses the language of war, fighting, and victory. Indeed, one influential view of organized athletic competitions is that they are a restructuring of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>instinct</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Instinct</b></span> to hunt and kill.
<br>
<br>With the great athletic festivals, which brought <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> together at set intervals of years to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Opel_Olympia</b></span> and later to <span style='color: blue'><b>Delphi</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Nemea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nemean_Games</b></span>, and the Isthmus (the four great Panhellenic, or all-Greek, games), one passes from the internal organization of individual <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> societies to their interrelationships. Two kinds of powerful interrelationship have already been noted—that between colonizing or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mother city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mother_City_F.C.</b></span> and daughter <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> and the shared membership of an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>amphictyony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Amphictyonic_League</b></span>. Mythical links between one <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> and another were maintained and exploited throughout all periods by a process which has been felicitously called <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>kinship</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kinship</b></span> diplomacy. The most common such link was that between mother and daughter <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> and involved the stressing of shared ancestry—that is, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>common descent</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_descent</b></span> from some mythical hero or founder figure. Such <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>kinship</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kinship</b></span> diplomacy was taken very seriously by all parties and as late as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenistic period</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hellenistic_period</b></span> was the basis for alliances or other sorts of common action. Modern historians tend to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>stress</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Portuguese_language</b></span> the particularism of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> culture—i.e., the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>separate development</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Apartheid</b></span> and carefully cultivated local identity of the individual polis. Networks of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>kinship</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kinship</b></span> diplomacy were one means by which this particularism was softened in practice.
<br>
<br>At the individual level, the basic institution in intercity relationships was that of guest-friendship, or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>xenia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xenia_motif</b></span>. That was another area where ritual elements were present to such a marked degree that the whole institution has been called ritualized friendship. The same aristocrats who drank and heard poetry together inside their own communities naturally expected to find comparable groups inside other states. They cemented their ties, which had perhaps been formed on initially casual or trading visits, with formal relationships of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>xenia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xenia_motif</b></span>. At some point quite early in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Archaic period</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archaic_Greece</b></span> that institution developed into something still more definite, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>proxenia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Proxeny</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Proxenoi</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Proxeny</b></span> were citizens of state A living in state A who looked after the interests of citizens of state B. The status of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>proxenos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Proxeny</b></span> was surely in origin hereditary, but by <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>’ time one hears of voluntary <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>proxenoi</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Proxeny</b></span> (etheloproxenoi). The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>antiquity</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> of the basic institution is not in doubt, however much the 5th-century <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> may have exploited and reshaped it for its own political convenience; a 7th-century inscription from the island of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corcyra</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corfu</b></span> mentioning a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>proxenos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Proxeny</b></span> from <span style='color: blue'><b>Locris</b></span> is the earliest attestation of the institution.
<br>
<br>Another way of institutionalizing relationships between the nationals of different states was <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>epigamia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Epigamia</b></span>, an arrangement by which the offspring of marriage were treated as citizens of the wife’s polis if the husband settled there; and so was the husband. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, for example, granted <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>epigamia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Epigamia</b></span> to <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span> as late as the 5th century, a time when <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> citizenship was fiercely protected. There are still earlier instances: usually one hears of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>epigamia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Epigamia</b></span> when for one reason or another it was being suspended or denied. Thus, there was an early arrangement between the islands of <span style='color: blue'><b>Andros</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Paros</b></span>, which, <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> says, ended when relations went sour. More interesting is the statement, again by <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>, that there was no intermarriage between members of two of the villages, or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>demes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Deme</b></span>, of <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pallene</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pallini</b></span> and Hagnous. Far from being evidence that these places were somehow originally separate states, the prohibition was more like a ban on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>endogamy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Endogamy</b></span>: in other words, the two communities were regarded—like members of a family—as being too close to be allowed to intermarry.
<br>
<br>Thus, both marriage itself and prohibition of marriage were ways of defining the relations between communities, including communities within a single large state like <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>, and of keeping those relations friendly. One way in which ties of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>xenia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xenia_motif</b></span> and marriage can now be traced in detail is the scientific study of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_language</b></span> personal names, because patterns of naming reflect social realities; foreign names enter a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>’s name pool as a result of both formal connections and less formal ones, such as temporary residence. Such <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>onomastic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Onomastics</b></span> evidence, as it is called, can now be studied in bulk and in depth, thanks to the computer-aided publication of all known <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_language</b></span> personal names, most of them attested from inscriptions.
<br>
<br>The chief vehicle of interaction among <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>poleis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Polis</b></span>, however, was through warfare and through the formal suspension or renunciation of warfare by means of heavily ritualized <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>treaties</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Treaty</b></span> (one of the most common words for such a treaty is spondai, which literally means libations to the guaranteeing gods). The earliest surviving inscriptional peace treaty for all time dates from the 6th century and was found at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Opel_Olympia</b></span>. Nonetheless, there were surely agreements to limit warfare over strips of boundary land before that date. Archaeology may offer unexpected help in this matter: it is possible and plausible that some <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>frontier</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Frontier</b></span> zones were by tacit or explicit agreement left <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>fallow</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Crop_rotation</b></span>. One such zone seems to have been the remote <span style='color: blue'><b>Skourta</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Plain</b></span>, which separates part of northern <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span> from <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span>; preliminary surface survey (i.e., the estimation of settlement patterns by gathering of potsherds) carried out in and after 1985 suggests that it was—perhaps deliberately—left uncultivated in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Archaic period</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archaic_Greece</b></span>.
<br>
<br>An important landmark in interstate military relations of the kind considered here was the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lelantine War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lelantine_War</b></span>. It was the earliest <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek</b></span> war (after the mythical <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Trojan War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Trojan_War</b></span>) that had any claim to be considered general, in the sense that it involved distant allies on each side. Fought in perhaps the later 8th century between the two main communities of <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Chalcis</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>, it took its name from the fertile <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lelantine Plain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lelantine_Plain</b></span>, which separates the cities and includes the site of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lefkandi</b></span>. (It is an interesting modern suggestion that <span style='color: blue'><b>Lefkandi</b></span> itself is the site of Old <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>, abandoned about 700 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> in favour of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>classical</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_antiquity</b></span> site <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> at the east end of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Plain</b></span>, perhaps as a consequence of <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>’s defeat in the war. This theory, however, needs to account for <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>’s statement that at the early 6th-century entertainment of the suitors of <span style='color: blue'><b>Cleisthenes</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicyon</b></span> there was one <span style='color: blue'><b>Lysanias</b></span> from <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>, then at the height of its prosperity.)
<br>
<br>Other faraway <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> states were somehow involved in the war; on this point <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> agrees with his great predecessor <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>. Thus, <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span> supported <span style='color: blue'><b>Chalcis</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>. Given Euboean priority in overseas settlement, it is natural to suppose that the links implied by the traditions about the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lelantine War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lelantine_War</b></span> were the result of Euboean overseas <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>energy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Energy</b></span>, but that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>energy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Energy</b></span> would hardly have turned casual contacts into actual alliances without a preliminary network of guest-friendships. Whether the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oracle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delphi</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Delphi</b></span> took sides in the war, as a modern speculation has it, is less certain, though there is no doubt that, by some means wholly mysterious to the 21st century, <span style='color: blue'><b>Delphi</b></span> often provided updated information about possible sites for settlement and even (as over <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrene</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrenaica</b></span>) gave the original stimulus to the emigration.
<br>
<br>One can be more confident in denying the thoroughly anachronistic notion that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lelantine War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lelantine_War</b></span> shows the existence of trade leagues at this early date. Religious amphictyonies are one thing, but trade leagues are quite another; the evidence, such as it is, suggests that early trade was carried on by entrepreneurial aristocratic individuals, who no doubt exploited their guest-friendships and formed more such friendships during their travels. It is true, however, that such individuals tended to come from areas where <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>arable land</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Arable_land</b></span> was restricted, and to this extent it is legitimate to speak in a generic way of those areas as having in a sense a more commercially minded population than others. One example of such an area is the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lelantine Plain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lelantine_Plain</b></span>, an exceptionally good piece of land on a notably barren and mountainous, though large, island. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> described one such trader from the later <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Archaic period</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archaic_Greece</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sostratus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sostratus_of_Cnidus</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span>, a man of fabulous wealth. Then in the early 1970s a remarkable inscription was found in Etruria—a dedication to <span style='color: blue'><b>Apollo</b></span> in the name of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sostratus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sostratus_of_Cnidus</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span>. This discovery revealed that the source of his wealth was trade with <span style='color: blue'><b>Etruria</b></span> and other parts of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Italy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Italian_Peninsula</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span> is an island whose estimated Classical population of about 40,000 was supported by land capable of supporting only about 4,000. One may quarrel with the first figure as too large and the second figure as too pessimistic (it makes insufficient allowance for the possibilities of highly intensive land use). Even after adjustment, however, it is clear that <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span> needed to trade in order to live. It is not surprising to find <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sostratus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sostratus_of_Cnidus</b></span>’s home <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span> included among the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> communities allowed to trade at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Naukratis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naucratis</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pharaonic Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span>; that arrangement is described by <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, and the site has been explored archaeologically. <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span> was the only participating <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> proper, as opposed to places in the eastern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_civilizations</b></span>
