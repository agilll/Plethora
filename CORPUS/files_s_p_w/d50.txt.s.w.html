The Battle of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Eurymedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Giants_(Greek_mythology)</b></span> was a double <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, taking place both on water and land, between the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and her <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span>, and the Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>. It took place in either 469 or 466 BC, in the vicinity of the mouth of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Eurymedon River</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Köprüçay_River</b></span> (now the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Köprüçay</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Köprüçay_River</b></span>) in <span style='color: blue'><b>Pamphylia</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>. It forms part of the Wars of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>, itself part of the larger <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> had been formed between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and many of the city-states of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> to continue the war with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, which had begun with the first and second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasions of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> (492–490 and 480–479 BC, respectively). In the aftermath of the Battles of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Plataea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Plataea</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>, which had ended the second invasion, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> had taken the offensive, besieging the cities of Sestos and <span style='color: blue'><b>Byzantium</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> then took over responsibility for the war, and continued to attack <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> bases in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> throughout the next decade.
<br>
<br>In either 469 or 466 BC, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> began assembling a large army and navy for a major offensive against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. Gathering near the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Eurymedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Giants_(Greek_mythology)</b></span>, it is possible that the expedition aimed to move up the coast of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>, capturing each <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> in turn. This would bring the Asiatic <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> regions back under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> control, and give the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> naval bases from which to launch further expeditions into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span>. Hearing of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> preparations, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> general <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span> took 200 triremes and sailed to <span style='color: blue'><b>Phaselis</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Pamphylia</b></span>, which eventually agreed to join the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>. This effectively blocked the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> strategy at its first objective.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span> then moved to pre-emptively attack the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> forces near the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Eurymedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Giants_(Greek_mythology)</b></span>. Sailing into the mouth of the river, <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span> quickly routed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet gathered there. Most of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet made land-fall, and the sailors fled to the shelter of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army. <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span> then landed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> marines and proceeded to attack the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army, which was also routed. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> captured the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> camp, taking many prisoners, and were able to destroy 200 beached <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> triremes. This stunning double victory seems to have greatly demoralised the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, and prevented any further <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> campaigning in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> until at least 451 BC. However, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> do not appear to have pressed home their advantage, probably because of other events in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> world that required their attention.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>military history</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Military_history</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> between the end of the second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> (431-404 BC) is poorly attested by surviving ancient sources. This period, sometimes referred to as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pentekontaetia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pentecontaetia</b></span> by ancient scholars, was a period of relative peace and prosperity within <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[1][2] The richest source for the period, and also the most contemporary with it, is <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s History of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span>, which is generally considered by modern historians to be a reliable primary account.[3][4][5] <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> only mentions this period in a digression on the growth of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> power in the run up to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span>, and the account is brief, probably selective and lacks any dates.[6][7] Nevertheless, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s account can be, and is used by historians to draw up a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>skeleton</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Skeleton</b></span> chronology for the period, on to which details from archaeological records and other writers can be superimposed.[6]
<br>
<br>Much extra detail for the period is provided by <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>, in his biographies of Aristides and especially <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> was writing some 600 years after the events in question, and is therefore very much a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>secondary source</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Secondary_source</b></span>, but he often explicitly names his sources, which allows some degree of verification of his statements.[8] In his biographies, he explicitly draws on many ancient histories that have not survived, and thus often preserves details of the period that <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s brief account omits. The final major extant source for the period is the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>universal history</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Universal_history</b></span> (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bibliotheca historica</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bibliotheca_historica</b></span>) of the 1st century BC <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sicilian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sicily</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Diodorus Siculus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Diodorus_Siculus</b></span>. Much of Diodorus's writing concerning this period seems to be derived from the much earlier <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephorus</b></span>, who also wrote a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>universal history</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Universal_history</b></span>.[9] However, from what little we know of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephorus</b></span>, historians are generally disparaging towards his history.[5] Diodorus, who has often been dismissed by modern historians,[10] is therefore not a particularly good source for this period. Indeed, one of his translators, Oldfather, says of Diodorus's account of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Eurymedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Giants_(Greek_mythology)</b></span> campaign that "...the three preceding chapters reveal Diodorus in the worst light...".[11] There is also a reasonable body of archaeological evidence for the period, of which inscriptions detailing probable tribute lists of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> are particularly important.[3][12]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> provides a succinct list of the main events occurring between the end of the second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion and the outbreak of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span>, but almost no chronological information.[13] Various attempts have been made to reassemble the chronology, but there is no definitive answer. The assumption central to these attempts is that <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> is describing the events in the appropriate chronological order.[14] The one firmly accepted date is 465 BC for the beginning of the Siege of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thasos</b></span>. This is based on an ancient <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>scholiast</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Scholia</b></span>'s annotation of a copy of <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeschines</b></span>'s works. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>scholiast</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Scholia</b></span> notes that the Athenians met disaster at the 'Nine-Ways' in the archonship of Lysitheus (known to be 465/464 BC).[6] <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> mentions this attack on the 'Nine-Ways' in connection with the beginning of the Siege of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thasos</b></span>, and since <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> says that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span> ended in its third year, the Siege of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thasos</b></span> therefore dates to c.465–463 BC.[15]
<br>
<br>The Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Eurymedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Giants_(Greek_mythology)</b></span> has been dated to 469 BC by <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>'s anecdote about the <span style='color: blue'><b>Archon</b></span> Apsephion (469/468 BC) choosing <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span> and his fellow generals as judges in a competition.[16] The implication is that <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span> had recently achieved a great victory, and the most likely candidate is <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Eurymedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Giants_(Greek_mythology)</b></span>.[15] However, since the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Eurymedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Giants_(Greek_mythology)</b></span> seems to have occurred after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span> (but before the Siege of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thasos</b></span>), the date of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Eurymedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Giants_(Greek_mythology)</b></span> is clearly constrained by the date of <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>. Whilst some accept a date of 469 or earlier for this <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>,[17][18] another school of thought places it as late as 467 BC.[19] Since the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Eurymedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Giants_(Greek_mythology)</b></span> seems to have occurred before <span style='color: blue'><b>Thasos</b></span>, the alternative date for this <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> would therefore be 466 BC.[19] Modern historians are split, some supporting 469 BC as the most likely date,[15][20][21] and others opting for 466 BC.[22][23]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> had their roots in the conquest of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>, and in particular <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>, by the Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> shortly after 550 BC. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> found the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> difficult to rule, eventually settling for sponsoring a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> in each <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>.[24] While <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> states had in the past often been ruled by tyrants, this was a form of government on the decline.[25] By 500 BC, <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> appears to have been ripe for rebellion against these <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> place-men. The simmering tension finally broke into open revolt due to the actions of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>. Attempting to save himself after a disastrous Persian-sponsored expedition in 499 BC, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> chose to declare <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span>.[26] This triggered similar revolutions across <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>, and indeed Doris and <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeolis</b></span>, beginning the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>.[27]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> states of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> allowed themselves to be drawn into this conflict by <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>, and during their only campaigning season (498 BC) they contributed to the capture and burning of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> regional capital of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>.[28] After this, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> carried on (without further outside aid) for a further 5 years, until it was finally completely crushed by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. However, in a decision of great historic significance, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> king <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> the Great decided that, despite successfully subduing the revolt, there remained the unfinished business of exacting punishment on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> for supporting the revolt.[29] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> had severely threatened the stability of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>'s empire, and the states of mainland <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> would continue to threaten that stability unless dealt with. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> thus began to contemplate the complete conquest of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, beginning with the destruction of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>.[29]
<br>
<br>In the next two decades there would be two <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasions of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, including some of the most famous battles in history. During the first invasion, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean islands</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> were added to the Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> was duly destroyed.[30] However, the invasion ended in 490 BC with the decisive <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> victory at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>.[31] Between the two invasions, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> died, and responsibility for the war passed to his son <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>.[32] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> then led the second invasion personally in 480 BC, taking an enormous (although oft-exaggerated) army and navy to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[33] Those <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> who chose to resist (the '<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span>') were defeated in the twin battles of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span> on land and at sea respectively.[34] All of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> except the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnese</b></span> thus fell into <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> hands, but then seeking to finally destroy the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> navy, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Wars_of_the_Delian_League</b></span>.[35] The following year, 479 BC, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> assembled the largest <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army yet seen and defeated the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion force at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Plataea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Plataea</b></span>, ending the invasion and the threat to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[36]

<br>According to tradition, on the same day as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Plataea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Plataea</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet defeated the demoralised remnants of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet in the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>.[37] This action marks the end of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion, and the beginning of the next phase in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek counterattack</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>.[38] After <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> again revolted, with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> now <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>powerless</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Powerless_(TV_series)</b></span> to stop them.[39] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet then sailed to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chersonesos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gallipoli</b></span>, still held by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, and besieged and captured the town of Sestos.[40] The following year, 478 BC, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> sent a force to capture the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Byzantium</b></span> (modern day <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Istanbul</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Constantinople</b></span>). The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span> was successful, but the behaviour of the Spartan general <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span> alienated many of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span>, and resulted in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span>'s recall.[41] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Byzantium</b></span> was the last action of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> alliance that defeated the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion.
<br>
<br>After <span style='color: blue'><b>Byzantium</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> was eager to end her involvement in the war.[41] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> were of the view that, with the liberation of mainland <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>, the war's purpose had already been reached. There was also perhaps a feeling that securing long-term security for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Asia</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> would prove impossible.[42] The loose alliance of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> states that fought against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>'s invasion was dominated by <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian league</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_League</b></span>. With the Spartan withdrawal, the leadership of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> now explicitly passed to the Athenians.[41][42] A congress was called on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>holy island</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lindisfarne</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Delos</b></span> to institute a new alliance to continue the fight against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. This alliance, now including many of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean islands</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span>, was formally constituted as the 'First <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> Alliance', commonly known as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>. According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>, the official aim of the League was to "avenge the wrongs they suffered by ravaging the territory of the king."[43] Forces of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> spent much of the next decade expelling the remaining <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> garrisons from <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span>, and expanding the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> territory controlled by the League.[42]
<br>
<br>Once the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> forces in <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span> had largely been neutralised, the Athenians seem to have gone about starting to extend the League in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>.[44][45] The islands of <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Chios</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Lesbos</b></span> seem to have become members of the original <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> alliance after <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>, and presumably were also therefore original members of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>.[46] However, it is unclear exactly when the other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> cities, or indeed the other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>, joined the league, though they certainly did at some point.[47] <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> attests the presence of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Byzantium</b></span> in 478 BC, so it is possible that at least some of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> cities joined the league in early 478 BC.[48] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> politician Aristides was said to have died in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pontus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kingdom_of_Pontus</b></span> (c. 468 BC) whilst on public business. Given that Aristides was responsible for organising the financial contributions of each League member, this trip may have been connected with expansion of the League into <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>.[49]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span>'s <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Eurymedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Giants_(Greek_mythology)</b></span> campaign itself seems to have begun in response to the assembly of a large <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet and army at <span style='color: blue'><b>Aspendos</b></span>, near the mouth of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Eurymedon River</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Köprüçay_River</b></span>.[44][45] It is usually argued that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were the would-be aggressors, and that <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span>'s campaign was launched to deal with this new threat.[14][44][45][50] Cawkwell suggests that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> build-up was the first concerted attempt to counter the activity of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> since the failure of the second invasion.[21] It is possible that internal strife within the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> empire had contributed to the length of time it took to launch this campaign.[21] Cawkwell outlines the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> strategic problems:
<br>
<br>"<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> was a land power which used its naval forces in close conjunction with its armies, not free ranging in enemy waters. In any case, secure naval bases were necessary. In the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> with land forces already operating in <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> and elsewhere along the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> seaboard, it was easy for a Royal army and navy to deal with the revolt, but in view of the general revolt of the [<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span>] cities in 479 BC and the subsequent successes of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> navies the only way for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> must have seemed to be to move along the coast restoring order in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> after <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>, with fleet and army moving together."[51]
<br>
<br>The nature of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>naval warfare</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naval_warfare</b></span> in the Ancient world, dependent as it was on large teams of rowers, meant that ships would have to make <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>landfall</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Landfall</b></span> every few days to resupply with food and water.[52] This severely limited the range of an Ancient fleet, and essentially meant that navies could only operate in the vicinity of secure naval bases.[53] Cawkwell therefore suggests that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> forces gathered at <span style='color: blue'><b>Aspendos</b></span> were aiming to move along the southern coast of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>, capturing each <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>, until eventually the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> navy could begin operating in <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> again.[45] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> would employ this strategy in reverse in winter of 333 BC. Lacking a navy with which to take on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> settled instead for denying the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> navy suitable bases, by capturing the ports of southern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>.[45]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> says that upon hearing that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> forces were gathering at <span style='color: blue'><b>Aspendos</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span> sailed from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cnidus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Knidos</b></span> (in <span style='color: blue'><b>Caria</b></span>) with 200 triremes. It is highly likely that <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span> had assembled this force because the Athenians had had some warning of a forthcoming <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> campaign to re-subjugate the Asiatic <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. Certainly, no other league business would have required such a great force.[45] <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span> may have been waiting in <span style='color: blue'><b>Caria</b></span> because he expected the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> to march straight into <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>, along the Royal road from <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>.[45] According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span> sailed with these 200 triremes to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Phaselis</b></span> (in <span style='color: blue'><b>Lycia</b></span>) but was refused admittance. He therefore began ravaging the lands of <span style='color: blue'><b>Phaselis</b></span>, but with the mediation of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chios</b></span> contingent of his fleet, the people of <span style='color: blue'><b>Phaselis</b></span> agreed to join the league. They were to contribute troops to the expedition, and to pay the Athenians ten talents.[44] The fact that <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span> pre-emptively sailed to and captured <span style='color: blue'><b>Phaselis</b></span> suggests that he anticipated a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> campaign to capture the coastal cities (as outlined above).[45] The presence of both army and navy at <span style='color: blue'><b>Aspendos</b></span> may have persuaded him that there was to be no immediate assault on <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>. By capturing <span style='color: blue'><b>Phaselis</b></span>, the furthest east <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> (and just to the west of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Eurymedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Giants_(Greek_mythology)</b></span>), he effectively blocked the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> campaign before it had begun, denying them the first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>naval base</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naval_base</b></span> they needed to control.[45] Taking further initiative, <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span> then moved to directly attack the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet at <span style='color: blue'><b>Aspendos</b></span>.[44]
<br>
<br>Reconstructed model of a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>trireme</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Trireme</b></span>, the type of ship in use by both the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> forces
<br>According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>, the League fleet consisted of 200 triremes. These were of the sleek <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> aphract (deckless) design, originally developed by <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> primarily for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ramming actions</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naval_ram</b></span>,[54] although they had been modified by <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span> to improve their suitability for boarding actions.[44]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The standard</span> <span style='color: green'><b>London_Evening_Standard</b></span> complement of a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>trireme</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Trireme</b></span> was 200 men, including 14 marines.[55] In the second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, each <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> ship had carried thirty extra marines,[56] and this was probably also true in the first invasion when the whole invasion force was apparently carried in triremes.[55] Furthermore, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chios</b></span> ships at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> also carried 40 marines each. This suggests that a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>trireme</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Trireme</b></span> could probably carry a maximum of 40–45 soldiers—triremes seem to have been easily destabilised by extra weight.[57] There were therefore probably around 5,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> marines with the League fleet.[44]
<br>
<br>Several different estimates for the size of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet are given. <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> says that there was a fleet of 200 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenician</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span> ships, and is generally considered the most reliable source.[58] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> gives numbers of 350 from <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephorus</b></span> and 600 from Phanodemus. Furthermore, <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> says that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet was awaiting 80 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenician</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span> ships sailing from <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyprus</b></span>.[44] Although <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s account is generally to be favoured, there may an element of truth in <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>'s assertion that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were awaiting further reinforcements; this would explain why <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span> was able to launch a pre-emptive assault on them.[44][58][59] There are no estimates in the ancient sources for the size of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> land army. However, the number of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> marines accompanying the fleet was presumably in the same range as the number of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> marines (c. 5,000), since the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> ships carried the same complement of troops.[56] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> quotes <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephorus</b></span> as saying that <span style='color: blue'><b>Tithraustes</b></span> was commander of the royal fleet, and Pherendatis of the infantry, but says that <span style='color: blue'><b>Callisthenes</b></span> named Ariomandes as overall commander.[44]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> gives only the barest of details for this <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>; the most reliable detailed account is given by <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>.[11] According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet was anchored off the mouth of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Eurymedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Giants_(Greek_mythology)</b></span>, awaiting the arrival of 80 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenician</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span> ships from <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyprus</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span>, sailing from <span style='color: blue'><b>Phaselis</b></span>, made to attack the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> before the reinforcements arrived, whereupon the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet, eager to avoid fighting, retreated into the river itself. However, when <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span> continued to bear down on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, they accepted <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>. Regardless of their numbers, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> line was quickly breached, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> ships then turned about, and made for the river bank. Grounding their ships, the crews sought sanctuary with the army waiting nearby.[44] Some ships may have been captured or destroyed during the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>naval battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naval_warfare</b></span>, but it seems likely that most were able to land.[58]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army now began to move towards the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet, which had presumably also grounded itself in order to capture the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> ships. Despite the weariness of his troops after this first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span>, seeing "that his men were exalted by the impetus and pride of their victory, and eager to come to close quarters with the Barbarians", landed the marines and proceeded to attack the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army.[44] Initially the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> line held the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> assault, but eventually, as at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>, the heavily armoured <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> proved superior, and routed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army. Fleeing back to their camp, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were then captured, along with their camp, by the victorious <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[60]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> says that 200 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenician</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span> ships were captured and destroyed.[61] It is highly unlikely that this occurred during the apparently brief <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>naval battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naval_warfare</b></span>, so these were probably grounded ships captured after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> and destroyed with fire, as has been the case at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>.[58] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> says that 200 ships were captured, in addition to those that were destroyed or fled.[44] It is possible that 'destroyed' in this context means sunk during the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, since the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> would almost certainly have destroyed the ships that they captured as well (as <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> indeed implies).[58] Since <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> only explicitly gives the number of ships destroyed, it is possible to reconcile <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>'s and <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s numbers, but it is not clear that this is the best approach. There are no estimates in the ancient sources for casualties amongst the troops of either side.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> says that, following his double victory, "though like a powerful athlete he had brought down two contests in one day...<span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span> still went on competing with his own victories."[60] <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span> supposedly sailed with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet as quickly as possible to intercept the fleet of 80 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenician</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span> ships the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> had expected. Taking them by surprise, he captured or destroyed the entire fleet.[60] However, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> does not mention this subsidiary action, and some have cast doubt on whether it actually happened.[58]
<br>
<br>According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>, one tradition had it that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> king (who at the time would still have been <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>) agreed a humiliating peace treaty in the aftermath of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Eurymedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Giants_(Greek_mythology)</b></span>.[60] However, as <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> admits, other authors denied that such a peace was made at this time, and the more logical date for any peace treaty would have been after the <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyprus</b></span> campaign of 450 BC.[62] The alternative suggested by <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> is that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> king acted as if he had made a humiliating peace with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, because he was so fearful of engaging in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> with them again.[60] It is generally considered unlikely by modern historians that a peace treaty was made in the aftermath of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Eurymedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Giants_(Greek_mythology)</b></span>.[63]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Eurymedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Giants_(Greek_mythology)</b></span> was a highly significant victory for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>, which probably ended once and for all the threat of another <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[22] It also seems to have prevented any <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> attempt to reconquer the Asiatic <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> until at least 451 BC.[64] The accession of further cities of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian league</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>, particularly from <span style='color: blue'><b>Caria</b></span>, probably followed <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span>'s campaign there.[65]
<br>
<br>Despite <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span>'s massive victory, something of a stalemate developed between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> and the League. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> do not appear to have pressed their advantage home in a meaningful way.[23] If the later date of 466 BC for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Eurymedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Giants_(Greek_mythology)</b></span> campaign is accepted, this might be because the revolt in <span style='color: blue'><b>Thasos</b></span> meant that resources were diverted away from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> to prevent the Thasians seceding from the League.[23] Conversely, as <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> suggests, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> adopted a very defensive strategy in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> for the next decade and a half.[60] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet was effectively absent from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> until 451 BC, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> ships were able to ply the coasts of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> with impunity.[60][66] The next major <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> campaign against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> would only occur in 460 BC, when the Athenians decided to support a revolt in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrapy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> empire. This campaign would last <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>6 years</span> <span style='color: green'><b>6_Years</b></span>, before eventually ending in disaster for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>
