<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient Greek</a> civilization, the period following <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mycenaean_Greece?lang=en'>Mycenaean civilization</a>, which ended about 1200 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>, to the death of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great?lang=en'>Alexander</a> the Great, in 323 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>. It was a period of political, philosophical, artistic, and scientific achievements that formed a legacy with unparalleled influence on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Western_culture?lang=en'>Western civilization</a>.
<br>
<br>The period between the catastrophic end of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mycenaean_Greece?lang=en'>Mycenaean civilization</a> and about 900 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> is often called a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_Dark_Ages?lang=en'>Dark Age</a>. It was a time about which <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> of the Classical age had confused and actually false notions. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>, the great <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_history?lang=en'>ancient historian</a> of the 5th century <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>, wrote a sketch of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> history from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trojan_War?lang=en'>Trojan War</a> to his own day, in which he notoriously fails, in the appropriate chapter, to signal any kind of dramatic rupture. (He does, however, speak of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> settling down gradually and colonizing <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italian_Peninsula?lang=en'>Italy</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily?lang=en'>Sicily</a>, and what is now western <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkey?lang=en'>Turkey</a>. This surely implies that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> was settling down after something.) <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> does indeed display sound knowledge of the series of migrations by which <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> was resettled in the post-Mycenaean period. The most famous of these was the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dorian_invasion?lang=en'>Dorian invasion</a>, which the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> called, or connected with, the legendary return of the descendants of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heracles?lang=en'>Heracles</a>. Although much about that invasion is problematic—it left little or no archaeological trace at the point in time where tradition puts it—the problems are of no concern here. Important for the understanding of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archaic_Greece?lang=en'>Archaic</a> and Classical periods, however, is the powerful belief in Dorianism as a linguistic and religious concept. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> casually but significantly mentions soldiers speaking the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doric_Greek?lang=en'>Doric dialect</a> in a narrative about ordinary military matters in the year 426. That is a surprisingly abstract way of looking at the subdivisions of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>, because it would have been more natural for a 5th-century <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> to identify soldiers by home cities. Equally important to the understanding of this period is the hostility to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doric_Greek?lang=en'>Dorians</a>, usually on the part of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionic_Greek?lang=en'>Ionians</a>, another linguistic and religious <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Subgroup?lang=en'>subgroup</a>, whose most-famous <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> was <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>. So extreme was this hostility that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doric_Greek?lang=en'>Dorians</a> were prohibited from entering <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionic_Greek?lang=en'>Ionian</a> sanctuaries; extant today is a 5th-century example of such a prohibition, an inscription from the island of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paros?lang=en'>Paros</a>.
<br>
<br>Phenomena such as the tension between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doric_Greek?lang=en'>Dorians</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionic_Greek?lang=en'>Ionians</a> that have their origins in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_Dark_Ages?lang=en'>Dark Age</a> are a reminder that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> civilization did not emerge either unannounced or uncontaminated by what had gone before. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Dark_Age_(Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer)?lang=en'>The Dark Age</a> itself is beyond the scope of this article. One is bound to notice, however, that archaeological finds tend to call into question the whole concept of a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_Dark_Ages?lang=en'>Dark Age</a> by showing that certain features of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> civilization once thought not to antedate about 800 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> can actually be pushed back by as much as two centuries. One example, chosen for its relevance to the emergence of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polis?lang=en'>city-state</a>, or polis, will suffice. In 1981 archaeology pulled back the curtain on the darkest phase of all, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Protogeometric_style?lang=en'>Protogeometric Period</a> (c. 1075–900 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>), which takes its name from the geometric shapes painted on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pottery?lang=en'>pottery</a>. A grave, rich by the standards of any period, was uncovered at a site called <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lefkandi?lang=en'>Lefkandi</a> on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Euboea?lang=en'>Euboea</a>, the island along the eastern flank of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attica?lang=en'>Attica</a> (the territory controlled by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>). <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Grave_(poem)?lang=en'>The grave</a>, which dates to about 1000 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>, contains the (probably cremated) remains of a man and a woman. The large bronze vessel in which the man’s ashes were deposited came from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyprus?lang=en'>Cyprus</a>, and the gold items buried with the woman are splendid and sophisticated in their workmanship. Remains of horses were found as well; the animals had been buried with their <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Snaffle_bit?lang=en'>snaffle</a> bits. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Grave_(poem)?lang=en'>The grave</a> was within a large collapsed house, whose form anticipates that of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language?lang=en'>Greek</a> temples two centuries later. Previously it had been thought that those temples were one of the first manifestations of the monumentalizing associated with the beginnings of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polis?lang=en'>city-state</a>. Thus, that find and those made in a set of nearby cemeteries in the years before 1980 attesting further contacts between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Egypt</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyprus?lang=en'>Cyprus</a> between 1000 and 800 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> are important evidence. They show that one corner of one island of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>, at least, was neither impoverished nor isolated in a period usually thought to have been both. The difficulty is to know just how exceptional <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lefkandi?lang=en'>Lefkandi</a> was, but in any view it has revised former ideas about what was and what was not possible at the beginning of the 1st millennium <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>.
<br>
<br>The term colonization, although it may be convenient and widely used, is misleading. When applied to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archaic_Greece?lang=en'>Archaic Greece</a>, it should not necessarily be taken to imply the state-sponsored sending out of definite numbers of settlers, as the later Roman origin of the word implies. For one thing, it will be seen that state formation may itself be a product of the colonizing movement.
<br>
<br>The first date in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> history is <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/776_BC?lang=en'>776 BCE</a>, the year of the first <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Olympic_Games?lang=en'>Olympic Games</a>. It was computed by a 5th-century-BCE researcher called <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hippias?lang=en'>Hippias</a>. He was originally from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elis?lang=en'>Elis</a>, a place in the western <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnese?lang=en'>Peloponnese</a> in whose territory <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opel_Olympia?lang=en'>Olympia</a> itself is situated. This date and the list of early victors, transmitted by another literary tradition, are likely to be reliable, if only because the list is so unassuming in its early reaches. That is to say, local victors predominate, including some <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Messene?lang=en'>Messenians</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Messene?lang=en'>Messene</a> lost its independence to neighbouring <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> during the course of the 8th century, and this fact is an additional guarantee of the reliability of the early Olympic victor list: Messenian victors would hardly have been invented at a time when <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Messene?lang=en'>Messene</a> as a political entity had ceased to exist. Clearly, then, record keeping and organized activity involving more than one community and centring on a sanctuary, such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opel_Olympia?lang=en'>Olympia</a>, go back to the early 8th century. (Such competitive activity is an example of what has been called peer-polity interaction.) Records imply a degree of literacy, and there too the tradition about the 8th century has been confirmed by late 20th-century finds. A cup, bearing the inscription in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language?lang=en'>Greek</a> in the Euboean script I am the cup of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nestor_the_Chronicler?lang=en'>Nestor</a>, can be securely dated to before 700 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>. It was found at an island site called <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ischia?lang=en'>Pithekoussai</a> (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ischia?lang=en'>Ischia</a>) on the Bay of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naples?lang=en'>Naples</a>.
<br>
<br>The early overseas activity of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Euboea?lang=en'>Euboeans</a> has already been remarked upon in connection with the discoveries at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lefkandi?lang=en'>Lefkandi</a>. They were the prime movers in the more or less organized—or, at any rate, remembered and recorded—phase of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language?lang=en'>Greek</a> overseas settlement, a process known as colonization. (Euboean priority can be taken as absolutely certain because archaeology supports the literary tradition of the Roman historian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livy?lang=en'>Livy</a> and others: Euboean <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pottery_of_ancient_Greece?lang=en'>pottery</a> has been found both at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ischia?lang=en'>Pithekoussai</a> to the west and at the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkish_language?lang=en'>Turkish</a> site of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Al-Mina?lang=en'>Al-Mina</a> to the east.) This more-organized phase began in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy?lang=en'>Italy</a> about 750 and in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily?lang=en'>Sicily</a> in 734 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>; its episodes were remembered, perhaps in writing, by the colonies themselves. The word organized needs to be stressed, because various considerations make it necessary to push back beyond that date the beginning of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> colonization. First, it is clear from archaeological finds, such as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lefkandi?lang=en'>Lefkandi</a> material, and from other new evidence that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> had already, before 750 or 734, confronted and exchanged goods with the inhabitants of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italian_Peninsula?lang=en'>Italy</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily?lang=en'>Sicily</a>. Second, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> says that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_Dark_Ages?lang=en'>Dark Age</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> sent colonies to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a>, and archaeology bears this out—however much one discounts for propagandist exaggeration by the imperial <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>’ own time of its <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prehistory?lang=en'>prehistoric</a> colonizing role. However, after the founding of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cumae?lang=en'>Cumae</a> (a mainland <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italian_language?lang=en'>Italian</a> offshoot of the island settlement of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ischia?lang=en'>Pithekoussai</a>) about 750 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> and of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily?lang=en'>Sicilian</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naxos?lang=en'>Naxos</a> and Syracuse in 734 and 733, respectively, there was an explosion of colonies to all points of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Compass?lang=en'>compass</a>. The only exceptions were those areas, such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>pharaonic Egypt</a> or inner <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a>, where the inhabitants were too militarily and politically advanced to be easily overrun.
<br>
<br>One may ask why the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> suddenly began to launch these overseas projects. It seems that commercial interests, greed, and sheer curiosity were the motivating forces. An older view, according to which <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archaic_Greece?lang=en'>Archaic Greece</a> exported its surplus population because of an uncontrollable rise in population, must be regarded as largely discredited. In the first place, the earliest well-documented colonial operations were small-scale affairs, too small to make much difference to the situation of the sending community (the metropolis, or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mother_City_F.C.?lang=en'>mother city</a>). That is certainly true of the colonization of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrenaica?lang=en'>Cyrene</a>, in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_Africa?lang=en'>North Africa</a>, from the island of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santorini?lang=en'>Thera</a> (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santorini?lang=en'>Santorin</a>); on this point, an inscription has confirmed the classic account by the 5th-century <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> historian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>. In the second place, population was not uncontrollable in principle: artificial means such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infanticide?lang=en'>infanticide</a> were available, not to mention more-modern techniques like <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Birth_control?lang=en'>contraception</a>. Considerations of this kind much reduce the evidential value of discoveries establishing, for example, that the number of graves in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attica?lang=en'>Attica</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Argolis?lang=en'>Argolid</a> (the area round <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Argos?lang=en'>Argos</a>) increased dramatically in the later <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_Dark_Ages?lang=en'>Dark Age</a> or that there was a serious <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drought?lang=en'>drought</a> in 8th-century <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attica?lang=en'>Attica</a> (that is the admitted implication of a number of dried-up wells in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Agora_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athenian agora</a>, or civic centre). In fact, no single explanation for the colonizing activity is plausible. Political difficulties at home might sometimes be a factor, as, for instance, at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>, which in the 8th century sent out a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colonies_in_antiquity?lang=en'>colony</a> to Taras (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Taranto?lang=en'>Tarentum</a>) in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy?lang=en'>Italy</a> as a way of getting rid of an unwanted <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mestizo?lang=en'>half-caste</a> group. Nor can one rule out simple craving for excitement and a desire to see the world. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lyric_poetry?lang=en'>lyric poetry</a> of the energetic and high-strung <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poetry?lang=en'>poet</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archilochus?lang=en'>Archilochus</a>, a 7th-century Parian involved in the colonization of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thasos?lang=en'>Thasos</a>, shows the kind of lively minded individual who might be involved in the colonizing movement.
<br>
<br>So far, the vague term community has been used for places that sent out colonies. Such <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagueness?lang=en'>vagueness</a> is historically appropriate, because those places themselves were scarcely constituted as united entities, such as a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a>, or polis. For example, it is a curious fact that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a>, which in 733 colonized <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syracuse_University?lang=en'>Syracuse</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily?lang=en'>Sicily</a>, was itself scarcely a properly constituted polis in 733. (The formation of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a> as a united entity is to be put in the second half of the 8th century, with precisely the colonization of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syracuse_University?lang=en'>Syracuse</a> as its first collective act.)
<br>
<br>The name given to polis formation by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> themselves was <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Synoecism?lang=en'>synoikismos</a>, literally a gathering together. Synoikismos could take one or both of two forms—it could be a physical concentration of the population in a single <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> or an act of purely political unification that allowed the population to continue living in a dispersed way. The classic discussion is by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>, who distinguishes between the two kinds of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Synoecism?lang=en'>synoikismos</a> more carefully than do some of his modern critics. He makes the correct point that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attica?lang=en'>Attica</a> was politically <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Synoecism?lang=en'>synoecized</a> at an early date but not physically <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Synoecism?lang=en'>synoecized</a> until 431 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> when <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pericles?lang=en'>Pericles</a> as part of his war policy brought the large rural population behind the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> walls of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>. A more extreme instance of a polis that was never fully <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Synoecism?lang=en'>synoecized</a> in the physical sense was <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>, which, as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> elsewhere says, remained settled by villages in the old <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> way. It was an act of conscious arrogance, a way of claiming to be invulnerable from attack and not to need the walls that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> again and again treats as the sign and guarantee of civilized polis life. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Urban_history?lang=en'>urban history</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> makes an interesting case history showing that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mycenaean_Greece?lang=en'>Mycenaean</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> was not so physically or psychologically secure as its <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> and Roman successors. The administrative centre of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mycenaean_Greece?lang=en'>Mycenaean</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> was probably in the Párnon Mountains at the excavated site of the Menelaion. Then <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archaic_Greece?lang=en'>Archaic</a> and Classical <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> moved down to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plain?lang=en'>plain</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Byzantine_Empire?lang=en'>Byzantine</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>, more insecure, moved out of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plain?lang=en'>plain</a> again to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Perch?lang=en'>perch</a> on the site of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mystras?lang=en'>Mistra</a> on the opposite western <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mountain?lang=en'>mountain</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Taygetus?lang=en'>Taygetos</a>. Finally, modern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> is situated, once again peacefully and confidently, on its old site on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plain?lang=en'>plain</a> of the river <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eurotas?lang=en'>Eurotas</a>.
<br>
<br>The enabling factors behind the beginnings of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language?lang=en'>Greek</a> polis have been the subject of intense discussion. One approach connects the beginnings of the polis with the first monumental buildings, usually temples like the great early 8th-century <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greek_temple?lang=en'>temple</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hera?lang=en'>Hera</a> on the island of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samos?lang=en'>Samos</a>. The concentration of resources and effort required for such constructions presupposes the formation of self-conscious polis units and may actually have accelerated it. As stated above, however, the evidence from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lefkandi?lang=en'>Lefkandi</a> makes it hard to see the construction of such monumental buildings as a sufficient cause for the emergence of the polis, a process or event nobody has yet tried to date as early as 1000 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>.
<br>
<br>Another related theory argues that the birth of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> was signaled by the placing of rural sanctuaries at the margins of the territory that a community sought to define as its own. That theory fits admirably a number of Peloponnesian sanctuaries; for instance, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greek_temple?lang=en'>temple</a> complex of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hera?lang=en'>Hera</a> staked out a claim, on the part of relatively distant <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Argos?lang=en'>Argos</a>, to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plain?lang=en'>plain</a> stretching between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> and sanctuary, and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinthian</a> sanctuary on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Promontory?lang=en'>promontory</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Perachora?lang=en'>Perachora</a>, also dedicated to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hera?lang=en'>Hera</a>, performed the same function. Yet there are difficulties. It seems that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isthmus_of_Corinth?lang=en'>Isthmia</a> sanctuary, which at first sight seems a good candidate for another <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinthian</a> rural sanctuary, was already operational as early as 900 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>, in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Protogeometric_style?lang=en'>Protogeometric Period</a>, and that date is surely too early for polis formation. Nor does the theory easily account for the rural <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greek_temple?lang=en'>temple</a> of the goddess <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aphaea?lang=en'>Aphaea</a> in the middle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegina?lang=en'>Aegina</a>. The sanctuary is admittedly a long way from the town of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegina?lang=en'>Aegina</a>, but <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegina?lang=en'>Aegina</a> is an island, and there is no obvious neighbour against whom territorial claims could plausibly have been asserted. Finally, a theory that has to treat the best-known polis—namely, Athens—and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attica?lang=en'>Attica</a> as in every respect exceptional is not satisfactory: there is no <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athenian</a> equivalent of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heraion_of_Argos?lang=en'>Argive Heraeum</a>.
<br>
<br>A third theory attacks the problem of the beginnings of the polis through burial practice. In the 8th century (it is said) formal burial became more generally available, and that democratization of burial is evidence for a fundamentally new attitude toward society. The theory seeks to associate the new attitude with the growth of the polis. There is, however, insufficient archaeological and historical evidence for that view (which involves an implausible hypothesis that the process postulated was discontinuous and actually reversed for a brief period at a date later than the 8th century). Moreover, it is vulnerable to the converse objection as that raised against the second theory: the evidence for the third theory is almost exclusively <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attica?lang=en'>Attic</a>, and so, even if it were true, it would explain <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> and only <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>.
<br>
<br>Fourth, one may consider a theory whose unspoken premise is a kind of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Environmental_determinism?lang=en'>geographic determinism</a>. Perhaps the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> landscape itself, with its small <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alluvial_plain?lang=en'>alluvial</a> plains often surrounded by defensible <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mountain?lang=en'>mountain</a> systems, somehow prompted the formation of small and acrimonious <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polis?lang=en'>poleis</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Endlessly_(album)?lang=en'>endlessly</a> going to war over boundaries. That view has its attractions, but the obvious objection is that, when <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> went to more-open areas such as Italy, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily?lang=en'>Sicily</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_Africa?lang=en'>North Africa</a>, they seem to have taken their animosities with them. That in turn invites speculations of a psychologically <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Determinism?lang=en'>determinist</a> sort; one has to ask, without hope of an answer, whether the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> were naturally particularist.
<br>
<br>A fifth enabling factor that should be borne in mind is the influence of the colonizing movement itself. The political structure of the metropolis, or sending <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a>, may sometimes have been inchoate. The new <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colonies_in_antiquity?lang=en'>colony</a>, however, threatened by hostile native neighbours, rapidly had to get its act together if it was to be a viable cell of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hellenistic_period?lang=en'>Hellenism</a> on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Foreign_Soil?lang=en'>foreign soil</a>. That effort in turn affected the situation in the metropolis, because <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colonies_in_antiquity?lang=en'>Greek colonies</a> often kept close religious and social links with it. A 4th-century inscription, for instance, attests close ties between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a> and its daughter <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Olbia?lang=en'>Olbia</a> in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Black_Sea?lang=en'>Black</a> Sea region. Here, however, as so often in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> history, generalization is dangerous; some mother-daughter relationships, like that between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corfu?lang=en'>Corcyra</a> (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corfu?lang=en'>Corfu</a>), were bad virtually from the start.
<br>
<br>A related factor is <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phoenicia?lang=en'>Phoenician</a> influence (related, because the early <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phoenicia?lang=en'>Phoenicians</a> were great colonizers, who must often have met trading <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>). The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phoenicia?lang=en'>Phoenician</a> coast was settled by communities similar in many respects to the early <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polis?lang=en'>poleis</a>. It is arguable that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phoenicia?lang=en'>Phoenician</a> influence, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phoenician_alphabet?lang=en'>Semitic</a> influence generally, on early <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> has been seriously underrated.
<br>
<br>Theories such as these are stimulating and may each contain a particle of truth. The better position, however, is that generalization itself is as yet premature; in particular, archaeologically based theoretical reconstructions need much more refining. All one can say in summary is that in roughly the same period—namely, the 8th century—a number of areas, such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Megara?lang=en'>Megara</a>, began to define their borders, deny autonomy to their constituent villages, and generally act as separate states. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attica?lang=en'>Attica</a>’s political <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Synoecism?lang=en'>synoecism</a>, which occurred a little earlier, was complete perhaps about 900. Tempting though it is to seek a single explanatory model for those very roughly contemporaneous processes, one should perhaps allow that different paths of development were followed in different areas, even in areas next door to each other. After all, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archaic_Greece?lang=en'>Archaic</a> and Classical histories of mighty democratic imperial <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>, of the miserable polis of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Megara?lang=en'>Megara</a> which nevertheless colonized <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Byzantium?lang=en'>Byzantium</a>, of wealthy, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oligarchy?lang=en'>oligarchic</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a>, and of federal <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeotia?lang=en'>Boeotia</a> were all very different even though <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Megara?lang=en'>Megara</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeotia?lang=en'>Boeotia</a> were close neighbours.
<br>
<br>One is perhaps on firmer ground when one examines the evidence for prepolis aggregations of larger units, often religious in character. There are a number of such associations whose origins lie in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_Dark_Ages?lang=en'>Dark Age</a> and whose existence surely promoted some feeling of local and particularist identity among the participants. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionians?lang=en'>Ionians</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a> formed themselves into a confederation of 12 communities, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionians?lang=en'>Ionian</a> Dodecapolis, with a common meeting place; and there were comparable groupings among the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dorians?lang=en'>Dorian Greeks</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a> and even among the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carians?lang=en'>Carians</a> (partially <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Hellenized</a> non-Greeks) in the same part of the world. The central location for such organizations was characteristically small and insignificant. One poorly attested but intriguing early <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archaic_Greece?lang=en'>Archaic</a> league was the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kalaureia?lang=en'>Calaurian</a> Amphictyony (an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amphictyonic_League?lang=en'>amphictyony</a> was a religious league of dwellers round about). <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kalaureia?lang=en'>Calauria</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Small_Island_(TV_film)?lang=en'>small island</a> now called Póros, was not a place of any consequence in itself, but the league’s seven members included <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegina?lang=en'>Aegina</a>, two major <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polis?lang=en'>poleis</a>. The most famous and enduring such <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amphictyonic_League?lang=en'>amphictyony</a>, however, was the one that, originally from a distance, administered the affairs of the sanctuary of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delphi?lang=en'>Delphi</a> in central <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>. That sanctuary contained the most-famous, though not the oldest, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delphi?lang=en'>oracle</a> (the oldest was at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dodona?lang=en'>Dodona</a>); oracles were a mechanism by which divinely inspired utterances were produced in answer to specific questions. Finally, it is worth noting an adventurous suggestion that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lefkandi?lang=en'>Lefkandi</a> itself might have been the centre of some kind of religious <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amphictyonic_League?lang=en'>amphictyony</a>, but, if so, this would be an exception to the principle that religious centres tended themselves to be insignificant, however mighty their participating members.
<br>
<br>Before attempting to characterize <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archaic_Greece?lang=en'>Archaic Greece</a>, one must admit candidly that the evidence is unsatisfactory. Only for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> is anything like a proper political tradition known, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>’s development toward the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athenian_democracy?lang=en'>democracy</a> of the 5th century was amazingly and untypically rapid by comparison with other states, many of which never became democratic at all. A tiny but salutary scrap of evidence makes this point: <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> in Book II of his History of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian War</a> casually mentions a man called Evarchus as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tyrant?lang=en'>tyrant</a> of a small northwestern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> polis called <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicomedia?lang=en'>Astacus</a> in the 420s <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>. But for this chance mention, one would never have guessed that tyranny could have existed or persisted in such a place so late or so long. Another difficulty is that, while a fair amount about the social structure of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Greece?lang=en'>Classical Athens</a> is known, some of it must go back to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archaic_Greece?lang=en'>Archaic</a> times; just how much is disputed.
<br>
<br>There is a further complication. In both the political and the social spheres, one has to reckon—chiefly at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>, but elsewhere too—with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Invented_tradition?lang=en'>invented tradition</a>, a distorting element for which proper allowance is only now beginning to be made. Thus, it seems that not just <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lycurgus_of_Sparta?lang=en'>Lycurgus</a>, the famous Spartan lawgiver (whose historicity was doubted even in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>antiquity</a>), but even a reforming figure like <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solon?lang=en'>Solon</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>, who certainly existed in the 6th century and large fragments of whose poetry still survive, was in some respects what anthropologists call a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Culture_hero?lang=en'>culture hero</a>. Much was projected onto him anachronistically or just wrongly, and reformers in later generations established their credentials by claiming (if they were reactionaries) that they were trying to get back to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solon?lang=en'>Solon</a> or (if they were democrats) that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solon?lang=en'>Solon</a> was their founding father. Such errors should not induce too much pessimism: at Athens at least, individual aristocratic families preserved oral traditions, which affected the later literary records in ways that can be properly understood with the help of anthropological analogy. That is to say, not all the evidence so preserved is unusable, but it needs handling in special ways.
<br>
<br>It has even been argued that social life too was creatively manipulated. Later <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language?lang=en'>Greek</a> cities contained, alongside such transparent political institutions as the Popular Assembly and the Deliberative (Probouleutic) Council, a more-opaque set of institutions, ostensibly based on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kinship?lang=en'>kinship</a> groupings. The biggest and most basic of these groupings were the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phyle?lang=en'>phylae</a>, or tribes, according to which the citizen body was subdivided. Thus, all <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dorians?lang=en'>Dorian</a> states had the same three tribes, and there were four <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionians?lang=en'>Ionian</a> tribes (although <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionians?lang=en'>Ionian</a> states were less conservative than <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dorians?lang=en'>Dorian</a>, and one finds among them a greater readiness to innovate; late 6th-century Athens, for example, switched from a four-tribe hereditary system of citizenship to a 10-tribe one based on simple residence as well as descent). Smaller subdivisions were the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phratry?lang=en'>phratry</a>, a word connected with a philological <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Proto-Indo-European_root?lang=en'>root</a> meaning brother, and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Genos?lang=en'>genos</a>, a smaller cluster of families (oikoi).
<br>
<br>The existence of these groupings in historical times is beyond question; one finds them controlling citizen intake (as in the so-called Demotionidai inscription from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attica?lang=en'>Attic</a> village of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decelea?lang=en'>Decelea</a>, datable to as late as the early 4th century <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>) and entering into complicated property arrangements. What has become a matter of debate, however, is the question of just how old they actually were. According to the most-skeptical view, the whole apparatus of tribe and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Genos?lang=en'>genos</a> was an invention without any <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_Dark_Ages?lang=en'>Dark Age</a> history to legitimate it. This view, which rests partly on the near absence of the relevant <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kinship_terminology?lang=en'>kinship terminology</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer?lang=en'>Homer</a>, is not ultimately convincing in its hypothesis of a kind of complicated collective fraud on posterity. Yet it is right to allow for an element of conscious antiquarianism at certain periods (the 320s in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> being one), which may well have affected specific traditions.
<br>Society and values
<br>
<br>The world of the colonizing states was aristocratic in the sense that a small number of exclusive clans within cities monopolized citizenship and political control. At <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a>, for example, political control was monopolized by the adult males of a single <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clan?lang=en'>clan</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bacchiadae?lang=en'>Bacchiadae</a>. They perhaps numbered no more than a couple of hundred. At <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> there was a general class of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eupatridae?lang=en'>Eupatridae</a>, a word that just means people of good descent—i.e., aristocrats. (The word may have had a simultaneous but narrower application to one single <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Genos?lang=en'>genos</a>. This, however, is disputed, and, in any event, that hypothetical family was only one among many privileged genē. The case, therefore, is not analogous to that of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bacchiadae?lang=en'>Bacchiadae</a>.) It is unlikely that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eupatridae?lang=en'>Eupatridae</a> were as rigidly defined as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bacchiadae?lang=en'>Bacchiadae</a>, and the negative tradition that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solon?lang=en'>Solon</a> in the early 6th century deprived them of their exclusive claim to political office may just be the excessively formal and precise way in which later ancient commentators described a positive change by which power was made more generally available than it had been before.
<br>
<br>With regard to those same early <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archaic_Greece?lang=en'>Archaic</a> times, one hears—for example, in the poetry of the 7th-century Boeotian Hesiod—of control, sometimes oppressively exercised, by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basileus?lang=en'>basileis</a> (singular <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basileus?lang=en'>basileus</a>). That word is usually translated as kings, and such titles as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athenian_democracy?lang=en'>Athenian</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basileus?lang=en'>basileus</a> (an official, or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eponymous_archon?lang=en'>archon</a>, with a defined religious competence, conveniently but less correctly called the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eponymous_archon?lang=en'>archon</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basileus?lang=en'>basileus</a> by modern scholars) are then explained as survivals of an age of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monarchy?lang=en'>monarchy</a>. That account in terms of fossilization certainly eases the awkwardness of explaining why, for instance, the wife of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eponymous_archon?lang=en'>archon</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basileus?lang=en'>basileus</a> was held to be ritually married to the god <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus?lang=en'>Dionysus</a>. The very existence of kingship in Geometric (as opposed to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mycenaean_Greece?lang=en'>Mycenaean</a>) <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>, however, has been challenged, and a case has been made (though not universally accepted) for seeing most of those <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archaic_Greece?lang=en'>Archaic</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basileus?lang=en'>basileis</a> not as kings in any sense but as hereditary nobles. In the latter case, there is no great difference between those <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basileus?lang=en'>basileis</a> and such aristocrats as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bacchiadae?lang=en'>Bacchiadae</a>.
<br>
<br>Life inside the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archaic_Greece?lang=en'>Archaic Greek</a> societies ruled by such families can be reconstructed only impressionistically and only at the top of the social scale; the evidence, to an extent unusual even in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greek_art?lang=en'>Greco-Roman</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_antiquity?lang=en'>antiquity</a>, is essentially elitist in its bias. Aristocratic values were transmitted both vertically, by family oral traditions, and horizontally, by means of a crucial institution known as the symposium, or feast, for which (many literary scholars now believe) much surviving <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archaic_Greece?lang=en'>Archaic</a> poetry was originally written. Perhaps much fine painted pottery was also intended for that market, though the social and artistic significance of such pottery is debated. Some scholars insist that the really wealthy would at all times have used gold and silver vessels, which, however, have not survived in any numbers because they were melted down long ago.
<br>
<br>Symposia were eating and dining occasions with a strong ritual element; their existence is reflected in the marked emphasis, in the Homeric poems, on ostentatious feasting and formal banqueting as assertions of status (what have been called feasts of merit). Thus, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sarpedon?lang=en'>Sarpedon</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer?lang=en'>Homer</a>’s <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iliad?lang=en'>Iliad</a> reminds <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glaucus?lang=en'>Glaucus</a> that both of them are honoured with seats of honour and full cups in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lycia?lang=en'>Lycia</a> and with land (a sacred precinct, or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Temenos?lang=en'>temenos</a>) to finance all the feasting. Symposia were confined to males (a reminder of the military ethos so prevalent in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer?lang=en'>Homer</a>); although when the institution was introduced, along with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vine?lang=en'>vine</a>, to Etruria—where much of the visual evidence comes from—it changed its character and became open to both sexes. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> symposium proper can be seen as an instrument of social control; it is a more-tangible unit of social organization, and one with better-attested Homeric antecedents, than the problematic genē or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phratry?lang=en'>phratries</a> discussed above.
<br>
<br>In Classical times, strong <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homosexuality?lang=en'>homosexual</a> attachments were another way in which values were inculcated, passed on by the older man (the erastes) to the younger <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pederasty_in_ancient_Greece?lang=en'>eromenos</a>, or beloved. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gym?lang=en'>gymnasium</a> was the venue where such relationships typically developed. As with the symposium, there was an almost ritual element to it all; certain gifts—such as, for example, the gift of a hare—were thought especially appropriate. The date, however, at which <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_Homosexuality_(book)?lang=en'>Greek homosexuality</a> became a central cultural institution is problematic; it is notoriously absent from the Homeric poems, a fact that some scholars explain as being the result of poetic reticence. The more-plausible view is that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homosexuality?lang=en'>homosexuality</a> was in some way connected with the rise of the polis and was part of what has been called the 8th-century renaissance. If so, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer?lang=en'>Homer</a>’s silence is after all significant: he does not mention it because in his time it was not yet important.
<br>
<br>Both symposia and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gym?lang=en'>gymnasia</a> in different ways mirrored or were preparatory to warfare (see below). <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Interpolis?lang=en'>Interpolis</a> athletic competitions (such as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Olympic_Games?lang=en'>Olympic Games</a>) are another reflection of warfare. Epinician poetry of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Greece?lang=en'>Classical period</a> (that is, victory poetry like that of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pindar?lang=en'>Pindar</a>, whose epinician odes celebrate the athletic victories of aristocratic individuals) constantly uses the language of war, fighting, and victory. Indeed, one influential view of organized athletic competitions is that they are a restructuring of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Instinct?lang=en'>instinct</a> to hunt and kill.
<br>
<br>With the great athletic festivals, which brought <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> together at set intervals of years to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opel_Olympia?lang=en'>Olympia</a> and later to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delphi?lang=en'>Delphi</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nemean_Games?lang=en'>Nemea</a>, and the Isthmus (the four great Panhellenic, or all-Greek, games), one passes from the internal organization of individual <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> societies to their interrelationships. Two kinds of powerful interrelationship have already been noted—that between colonizing or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mother_City_F.C.?lang=en'>mother city</a> and daughter <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> and the shared membership of an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amphictyonic_League?lang=en'>amphictyony</a>. Mythical links between one <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> and another were maintained and exploited throughout all periods by a process which has been felicitously called <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kinship?lang=en'>kinship</a> diplomacy. The most common such link was that between mother and daughter <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> and involved the stressing of shared ancestry—that is, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_descent?lang=en'>common descent</a> from some mythical hero or founder figure. Such <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kinship?lang=en'>kinship</a> diplomacy was taken very seriously by all parties and as late as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hellenistic_period?lang=en'>Hellenistic period</a> was the basis for alliances or other sorts of common action. Modern historians tend to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portuguese_language?lang=en'>stress</a> the particularism of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> culture—i.e., the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apartheid?lang=en'>separate development</a> and carefully cultivated local identity of the individual polis. Networks of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kinship?lang=en'>kinship</a> diplomacy were one means by which this particularism was softened in practice.
<br>
<br>At the individual level, the basic institution in intercity relationships was that of guest-friendship, or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xenia_motif?lang=en'>xenia</a>. That was another area where ritual elements were present to such a marked degree that the whole institution has been called ritualized friendship. The same aristocrats who drank and heard poetry together inside their own communities naturally expected to find comparable groups inside other states. They cemented their ties, which had perhaps been formed on initially casual or trading visits, with formal relationships of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xenia_motif?lang=en'>xenia</a>. At some point quite early in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archaic_Greece?lang=en'>Archaic period</a> that institution developed into something still more definite, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Proxeny?lang=en'>proxenia</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Proxeny?lang=en'>Proxenoi</a> were citizens of state A living in state A who looked after the interests of citizens of state B. The status of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Proxeny?lang=en'>proxenos</a> was surely in origin hereditary, but by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>’ time one hears of voluntary <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Proxeny?lang=en'>proxenoi</a> (etheloproxenoi). The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>antiquity</a> of the basic institution is not in doubt, however much the 5th-century <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Athenian empire</a> may have exploited and reshaped it for its own political convenience; a 7th-century inscription from the island of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corfu?lang=en'>Corcyra</a> mentioning a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Proxeny?lang=en'>proxenos</a> from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Locris?lang=en'>Locris</a> is the earliest attestation of the institution.
<br>
<br>Another way of institutionalizing relationships between the nationals of different states was <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epigamia?lang=en'>epigamia</a>, an arrangement by which the offspring of marriage were treated as citizens of the wife’s polis if the husband settled there; and so was the husband. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>, for example, granted <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epigamia?lang=en'>epigamia</a> to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Euboea?lang=en'>Euboea</a> as late as the 5th century, a time when <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athenian</a> citizenship was fiercely protected. There are still earlier instances: usually one hears of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epigamia?lang=en'>epigamia</a> when for one reason or another it was being suspended or denied. Thus, there was an early arrangement between the islands of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Andros?lang=en'>Andros</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paros?lang=en'>Paros</a>, which, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> says, ended when relations went sour. More interesting is the statement, again by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a>, that there was no intermarriage between members of two of the villages, or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deme?lang=en'>demes</a>, of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attica?lang=en'>Attica</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pallini?lang=en'>Pallene</a> and Hagnous. Far from being evidence that these places were somehow originally separate states, the prohibition was more like a ban on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Endogamy?lang=en'>endogamy</a>: in other words, the two communities were regarded—like members of a family—as being too close to be allowed to intermarry.
<br>
<br>Thus, both marriage itself and prohibition of marriage were ways of defining the relations between communities, including communities within a single large state like <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attica?lang=en'>Attica</a>, and of keeping those relations friendly. One way in which ties of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xenia_motif?lang=en'>xenia</a> and marriage can now be traced in detail is the scientific study of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language?lang=en'>Greek</a> personal names, because patterns of naming reflect social realities; foreign names enter a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a>’s name pool as a result of both formal connections and less formal ones, such as temporary residence. Such <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Onomastics?lang=en'>onomastic</a> evidence, as it is called, can now be studied in bulk and in depth, thanks to the computer-aided publication of all known <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language?lang=en'>Greek</a> personal names, most of them attested from inscriptions.
<br>
<br>The chief vehicle of interaction among <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polis?lang=en'>poleis</a>, however, was through warfare and through the formal suspension or renunciation of warfare by means of heavily ritualized <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty?lang=en'>treaties</a> (one of the most common words for such a treaty is spondai, which literally means libations to the guaranteeing gods). The earliest surviving inscriptional peace treaty for all time dates from the 6th century and was found at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opel_Olympia?lang=en'>Olympia</a>. Nonetheless, there were surely agreements to limit warfare over strips of boundary land before that date. Archaeology may offer unexpected help in this matter: it is possible and plausible that some <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frontier?lang=en'>frontier</a> zones were by tacit or explicit agreement left <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crop_rotation?lang=en'>fallow</a>. One such zone seems to have been the remote <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Skourta?lang=en'>Skourta</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plain?lang=en'>plain</a>, which separates part of northern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attica?lang=en'>Attica</a> from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeotia?lang=en'>Boeotia</a>; preliminary surface survey (i.e., the estimation of settlement patterns by gathering of potsherds) carried out in and after 1985 suggests that it was—perhaps deliberately—left uncultivated in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archaic_Greece?lang=en'>Archaic period</a>.
<br>
<br>An important landmark in interstate military relations of the kind considered here was the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lelantine_War?lang=en'>Lelantine War</a>. It was the earliest <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greek?lang=en'>Greek</a> war (after the mythical <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trojan_War?lang=en'>Trojan War</a>) that had any claim to be considered general, in the sense that it involved distant allies on each side. Fought in perhaps the later 8th century between the two main communities of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Euboea?lang=en'>Euboea</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chalcis?lang=en'>Chalcis</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eretria?lang=en'>Eretria</a>, it took its name from the fertile <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lelantine_Plain?lang=en'>Lelantine Plain</a>, which separates the cities and includes the site of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lefkandi?lang=en'>Lefkandi</a>. (It is an interesting modern suggestion that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lefkandi?lang=en'>Lefkandi</a> itself is the site of Old <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eretria?lang=en'>Eretria</a>, abandoned about 700 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> in favour of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_antiquity?lang=en'>classical</a> site <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eretria?lang=en'>Eretria</a> at the east end of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plain?lang=en'>plain</a>, perhaps as a consequence of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eretria?lang=en'>Eretria</a>’s defeat in the war. This theory, however, needs to account for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>’s statement that at the early 6th-century entertainment of the suitors of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cleisthenes?lang=en'>Cleisthenes</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicyon?lang=en'>Sicyon</a> there was one <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lysanias?lang=en'>Lysanias</a> from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eretria?lang=en'>Eretria</a>, then at the height of its prosperity.)
<br>
<br>Other faraway <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> states were somehow involved in the war; on this point <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> agrees with his great predecessor <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>. Thus, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samos?lang=en'>Samos</a> supported <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chalcis?lang=en'>Chalcis</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eretria?lang=en'>Eretria</a>. Given Euboean priority in overseas settlement, it is natural to suppose that the links implied by the traditions about the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lelantine_War?lang=en'>Lelantine War</a> were the result of Euboean overseas <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Energy?lang=en'>energy</a>, but that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Energy?lang=en'>energy</a> would hardly have turned casual contacts into actual alliances without a preliminary network of guest-friendships. Whether the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delphi?lang=en'>oracle</a> at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delphi?lang=en'>Delphi</a> took sides in the war, as a modern speculation has it, is less certain, though there is no doubt that, by some means wholly mysterious to the 21st century, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delphi?lang=en'>Delphi</a> often provided updated information about possible sites for settlement and even (as over <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrenaica?lang=en'>Cyrene</a>) gave the original stimulus to the emigration.
<br>
<br>One can be more confident in denying the thoroughly anachronistic notion that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lelantine_War?lang=en'>Lelantine War</a> shows the existence of trade leagues at this early date. Religious amphictyonies are one thing, but trade leagues are quite another; the evidence, such as it is, suggests that early trade was carried on by entrepreneurial aristocratic individuals, who no doubt exploited their guest-friendships and formed more such friendships during their travels. It is true, however, that such individuals tended to come from areas where <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arable_land?lang=en'>arable land</a> was restricted, and to this extent it is legitimate to speak in a generic way of those areas as having in a sense a more commercially minded population than others. One example of such an area is the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lelantine_Plain?lang=en'>Lelantine Plain</a>, an exceptionally good piece of land on a notably barren and mountainous, though large, island. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> described one such trader from the later <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archaic_Greece?lang=en'>Archaic period</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sostratus_of_Cnidus?lang=en'>Sostratus</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegina?lang=en'>Aegina</a>, a man of fabulous wealth. Then in the early 1970s a remarkable inscription was found in Etruria—a dedication to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo?lang=en'>Apollo</a> in the name of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sostratus_of_Cnidus?lang=en'>Sostratus</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegina?lang=en'>Aegina</a>. This discovery revealed that the source of his wealth was trade with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Etruria?lang=en'>Etruria</a> and other parts of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italian_Peninsula?lang=en'>Italy</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegina?lang=en'>Aegina</a> is an island whose estimated Classical population of about 40,000 was supported by land capable of supporting only about 4,000. One may quarrel with the first figure as too large and the second figure as too pessimistic (it makes insufficient allowance for the possibilities of highly intensive land use). Even after adjustment, however, it is clear that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegina?lang=en'>Aegina</a> needed to trade in order to live. It is not surprising to find <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sostratus_of_Cnidus?lang=en'>Sostratus</a>’s home <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegina?lang=en'>Aegina</a> included among the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> communities allowed to trade at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naucratis?lang=en'>Naukratis</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>pharaonic Egypt</a>; that arrangement is described by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, and the site has been explored archaeologically. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegina?lang=en'>Aegina</a> was the only participating <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> proper, as opposed to places in the eastern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegean_civilizations?lang=en'>Aegean</a>
