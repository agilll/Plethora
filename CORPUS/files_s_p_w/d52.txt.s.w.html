The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> (431–404 BC) was an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ancient Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> war fought by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> led by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_League</b></span> led by <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>. Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases. In the first phase, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Archidamian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> launched repeated invasions of <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>, while <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span> and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire. This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC, with the signing of the Peace of <span style='color: blue'><b>Nicias</b></span>. That treaty, however, was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>. In 415 BC, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Syracuse</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Syracuse_Orange_football</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicily</b></span>; the attack failed disastrously, with the destruction of the entire force, in 413 BC. This ushered in the final phase of the war, generally referred to either as the Decelean War, or the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> War. In this phase, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, now receiving support from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, supported rebellions in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>' subject states in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean Sea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>, undermining <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>' empire, and, eventually, depriving the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of naval supremacy. The destruction of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>' fleet at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegospotami</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Aegospotami</b></span> effectively ended the war, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> surrendered in the following year. <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia</b></span> demanded that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> should be destroyed and all its citizens should be enslaved, but <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> refused.
<br>
<br>The term "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> " was never used by <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>, by far its major historian: that the term is all but universally used today is a reflection of the Athens-centric sympathies of modern historians. As prominent historian J. B. <span style='color: blue'><b>Bury</b></span> remarks, the Peloponnesians would have considered it the "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Attic War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Attic_War</b></span>".[1]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> reshaped the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ancient Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> world. On the level of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>international</span> <span style='color: green'><b>International_law</b></span> relations, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, the strongest <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city-state</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Polis</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> prior to the war's beginning, was reduced to a state of near-complete subjection, while <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> became established as the leading power of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. The economic costs of the war were felt all across <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>poverty</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Poverty</b></span> became widespread in the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>, while <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> found itself completely devastated, and never regained its pre-war prosperity.[2][3] The war also wrought subtler changes to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> society; the conflict between democratic <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oligarchic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Oligarchy</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, each of which supported friendly political factions within other states, made <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>civil war</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Civil_war</b></span> a common occurrence in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> world.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> warfare, meanwhile, originally a limited and formalized form of conflict, was transformed into an all-out struggle between city-states, complete with atrocities on a large scale. Shattering religious and cultural taboos, devastating vast swathes of countryside, and destroying whole cities, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> marked the dramatic end to the fifth century BC and the golden age of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[4]
<br>
<br>As the preeminent <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> historian, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>, wrote in his influential History of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span>, "The growth of the power of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, and the alarm which this inspired in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lacedaemon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sparta</b></span>, made war inevitable."[5] Indeed, the nearly fifty years of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> history that preceded the outbreak of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> had been marked by the development of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> as a major power in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mediterranean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mediterranean_Sea</b></span> world. Its empire began as a small group of city-states, called the Delian League—from the island of <span style='color: blue'><b>Delos</b></span>, on which they kept their treasury—that came together to ensure that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> were truly over. After defeating the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> in the year 480 BC, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> led the coalition of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states that continued the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> with attacks on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> territories in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>. What then ensued was a period, referred to as the <span style='color: blue'><b>Pentecontaetia</b></span> (the name given by <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>), in which <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> increasingly became in fact an empire,[6] carrying out an aggressive war against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> and increasingly dominating other city-states. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> proceeded to bring under its control all of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> except for <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> and its allies, ushering in a period which is known to history as the Athenian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span>. By the middle of the century, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> had been driven from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> and forced to cede control of a vast range of territories to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>. At the same time, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> greatly increased its own power; a number of its formerly independent allies were reduced, over the course of the century, to the status of tribute-paying subject states of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>. This tribute was used to support a powerful fleet and, after the middle of the century, to fund massive <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>public works</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Public_works</b></span> programs in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, causing resentment.[7]
<br>
<br>Friction between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and the Peloponnesian states, including <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, began early in the <span style='color: blue'><b>Pentecontaetia</b></span>; in the wake of the departure of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> attempted to prevent the reconstruction of the walls of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> (without the walls, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> would have been <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>defenseless</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Defenseless</b></span> against a land attack and subject to Spartan control), but was rebuffed.[8] According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>, although the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> took no action at this time, they "secretly felt aggrieved".[9] Conflict between the states flared up again in 465 BC, when a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helot</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span> revolt broke out in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> summoned forces from all of their allies, including <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, to help them suppress the revolt. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> sent out a sizable contingent (4,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>), but upon its arrival, this force was dismissed by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, while those of all the other allies were permitted to remain. According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> acted in this way out of fear that the Athenians would switch sides and support the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helots</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span>; the offended Athenians repudiated their alliance with <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>.[10] When the rebellious <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helots</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span> were finally forced to surrender and permitted to evacuate the state, the Athenians settled them at the strategic <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Naupactus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nafpaktos</b></span> on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthian Gulf</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gulf_of_Corinth</b></span>.[11]
<br>
<br>In <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>459 BC</span> <span style='color: green'><b>459_BC</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> took advantage of a war between its neighbors <span style='color: blue'><b>Megara</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span>, both Spartan allies, to conclude an alliance with <span style='color: blue'><b>Megara</b></span>, giving the Athenians a critical foothold on the Isthmus of <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span>. A fifteen-year conflict, commonly known as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>First Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>First_Peloponnesian_War</b></span>, ensued, in which <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> fought intermittently against <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span>, and a number of other states. For a time during this conflict, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> controlled not only <span style='color: blue'><b>Megara</b></span> but also <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span>; at its end, however, in the face of a massive Spartan invasion of <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>, the Athenians ceded the lands they had won on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> mainland, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> recognized each other's right to control their respective alliance systems.[12] The war was officially ended by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thirty Years' Peace</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thirty_Years'_Peace</b></span>, signed in the winter of 446/5 BC.[13]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thirty Years' Peace</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thirty_Years'_Peace</b></span> was first tested in 440 BC, when <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>' powerful ally <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span> rebelled from its alliance with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>. The rebels quickly secured the support of a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> found itself facing the prospect of revolts throughout the empire. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, whose intervention would have been the trigger for a massive war to determine the fate of the empire, called a congress of their allies to discuss the possibility of war with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>'s powerful ally <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> was notably opposed to intervention, and the congress voted against war with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>. The Athenians crushed the revolt, and peace was maintained.[14]
<br>
<br>The more immediate events that led to war involved <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span>. After suffering a defeat at the hands of their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>colony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Colonies_in_antiquity</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corcyra</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corfu</b></span>, a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sea power</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naval_warfare</b></span> that was not allied to either <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> began to build an allied naval force. Alarmed, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corcyra</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corfu</b></span> sought an alliance with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, which after debate and input from both <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corcyra</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corfu</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span>, decided to swear a defensive alliance with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corcyra</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corfu</b></span>. At the Battle of Sybota, a small contingent of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> ships played a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>critical role</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Critical_Role</b></span> in preventing a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corinth</b></span> fleet from capturing <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corcyra</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corfu</b></span>. In order to uphold the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thirty Years' Peace</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thirty_Years'_Peace</b></span>, however, the Athenians were instructed not to intervene in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> unless it was clear that <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> was going to press onward to invade <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corcyra</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corfu</b></span>. However, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian warships</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Trireme</b></span> participated in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> nevertheless, and the arrival of additional <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian warships</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Trireme</b></span> was enough to dissuade the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Corinth</b></span> from exploiting their victory, thus sparing much of the routed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corcyraean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corfu</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> fleet.[15]
<br>
<br>Following this, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> instructed <span style='color: blue'><b>Potidaea</b></span> (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chalcidice</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chalkidiki</b></span> peninsula), a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tributary</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tribute</b></span> ally of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> but a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>colony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Colonies_in_antiquity</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span>, to tear down its walls, send hostages to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, dismiss the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corinth</b></span> magistrates from office, and refuse the magistrates that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> would send in the future.[16] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Corinth</b></span>, outraged by these actions, encouraged <span style='color: blue'><b>Potidaea</b></span> to revolt and assured them that they would ally with them should they revolt from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>. Meanwhile, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Corinth</b></span> were unofficially aiding <span style='color: blue'><b>Potidaea</b></span> by sneaking contingents of men into the besieged <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> to help defend it. This was a direct violation of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thirty Years' Peace</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thirty_Years'_Peace</b></span>, which had (among other things) stipulated that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_League</b></span> would respect each other's autonomy and internal affairs.
<br>
<br>A further source of provocation was an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> decree, issued in 433/2 BC, imposing stringent trade sanctions on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Megarian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Megara</b></span> citizens (once more a Spartan ally after the conclusion of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>First Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>First_Peloponnesian_War</b></span>). It was alleged that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Megarians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Megara</b></span> had desecrated the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hiera Orgas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hiera_Orgas</b></span>. These sanctions, known as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Megarian decree</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Megarian_decree</b></span>, were largely ignored by <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>, but some modern economic historians have noted that forbidding <span style='color: blue'><b>Megara</b></span> to trade with the prosperous <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> would have been disastrous for the Megarans, and have accordingly considered the decree to be a contributing factor in bringing about the war.[17] Historians that attribute responsibility for the war to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> cite this event as the main cause for blame.[18]

<br>At the request of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Corinth</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> summoned members of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_League</b></span> to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> in 432 BC, especially those who had grievances with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> to make their complaints to the Spartan assembly. This debate was attended by members of the league and an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>uninvited</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Uninvited_(song)</b></span> delegation from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, which also asked to speak, and became the scene of a debate between the Athenians and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Corinth</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> reports that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Corinth</b></span> condemned <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>'s inactivity up to that point, warning the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> that if they continued to remain passive while the Athenians were energetically active, they would soon find themselves outflanked and without allies.[19] The Athenians, in response, reminded the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> of their record of military success and opposition to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, and warned them of the dangers of confronting such a powerful state, ultimately encouraging <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> to seek arbitration as provided by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thirty Years' Peace</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thirty_Years'_Peace</b></span>.[20] Undeterred, a majority of the Spartan assembly voted to declare that the Athenians had broken the peace, essentially declaring war.[21]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> and its allies, with the exception of <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span>, were almost exclusively land-based powers, able to summon large land armies which were very nearly unbeatable (thanks to the legendary Spartan forces). The Athenian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span>, although based in the peninsula of <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>, spread out across the islands of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean Sea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span>; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> drew its immense wealth from tribute paid from these islands. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> maintained its empire through naval power. Thus, the two powers were relatively unable to fight decisive battles.
<br>
<br>The Spartan strategy during the first war, known as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Archidamian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> (431–421 BC) after <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>'s king <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Archidamus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archidamus_II</b></span>, was to invade the land surrounding <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>. While this invasion deprived Athenians of the productive land around their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> itself was able to maintain access to the sea, and did not suffer much. Many of the citizens of <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span> abandoned their farms and moved inside the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Long Walls</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Long_Walls</b></span>, which connected <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> to its port of <span style='color: blue'><b>Piraeus</b></span>. At the end of the first year of the war, <span style='color: blue'><b>Pericles</b></span> gave his famous <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Funeral Oration</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pericles'_Funeral_Oration</b></span> (431 BC).
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> also occupied <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span> for periods of only three weeks at a time; in the tradition of earlier <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> warfare the soldiers were expected to go home to participate in the harvest. Moreover, Spartan slaves, known as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helots</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span>, needed to be kept under control, and could not be left unsupervised for long periods of time. The longest Spartan invasion, in 430 BC, lasted just forty days.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> strategy was initially guided by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>strategos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Strategos</b></span>, or general, <span style='color: blue'><b>Pericles</b></span>, who advised the Athenians to avoid open <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> with the far more numerous and better trained Spartan <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>, relying instead on the fleet. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> fleet, the most dominant in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, went on the offensive, winning a victory at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Naupactus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nafpaktos</b></span>. In 430 BC an outbreak of a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plague</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Black_Death</b></span> hit <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plague</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Black_Death</b></span> ravaged the densely packed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>, and in the long run, was a significant cause of its final defeat. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plague</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Black_Death</b></span> wiped out over 30,000 citizens, sailors and soldiers, including <span style='color: blue'><b>Pericles</b></span> and his sons. Roughly one-third to two-thirds of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> population died. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> manpower was correspondingly drastically reduced and even foreign <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mercenaries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mercenary</b></span> refused to hire themselves out to a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> riddled with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plague</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Black_Death</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The fear</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_characters_in_the_Metal_Gear_series</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plague</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Black_Death</b></span> was so widespread that the Spartan invasion of <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span> was abandoned, their troops being unwilling to risk contact with the diseased enemy.
<br>
<br>After the death of <span style='color: blue'><b>Pericles</b></span>, the Athenians turned somewhat against his conservative, defensive strategy and to the more aggressive strategy of bringing the war to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> and its allies. Rising to particular importance in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span> at this time was <span style='color: blue'><b>Cleon</b></span>, a leader of the hawkish elements of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span>. Led militarily by a clever new general <span style='color: blue'><b>Demosthenes</b></span> (not to be confused with the later <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> orator <span style='color: blue'><b>Demosthenes</b></span>), the Athenians managed some successes as they continued their naval raids on the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> stretched their military activities into <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Aetolia</b></span>, quelled the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mytilenean revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mytilenean_revolt</b></span> and began fortifying posts around the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>. One of these posts was near <span style='color: blue'><b>Pylos</b></span> on a tiny island called <span style='color: blue'><b>Sphacteria</b></span>, where the course of the first war turned in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>'s favour. The post off <span style='color: blue'><b>Pylos</b></span> struck <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> where it was weakest: its <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dependence</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Substance_dependence</b></span> on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helots</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span>, who tended the fields while its citizens trained to become soldiers. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helots</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span> made the Spartan system possible, but now the post off <span style='color: blue'><b>Pylos</b></span> began attracting <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helot</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span> runaways. In addition, the fear of a general revolt of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helots</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span> emboldened by the nearby <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> presence drove the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> to action. <span style='color: blue'><b>Demosthenes</b></span>, however, outmanoeuvred the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> in the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Pylos</b></span> in 425 BC and trapped a group of Spartan soldiers on <span style='color: blue'><b>Sphacteria</b></span> as he waited for them to surrender. Weeks later, though, <span style='color: blue'><b>Demosthenes</b></span> proved unable to finish off the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>. After boasting that he could put an end to the affair in the Assembly, the inexperienced <span style='color: blue'><b>Cleon</b></span> won a great victory at the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sphacteria</b></span>. The Athenians captured 300 Spartan <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The hostages</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Hostages</b></span> gave the Athenians a bargaining chip.
<br>
<br>After these battles, the Spartan general <span style='color: blue'><b>Brasidas</b></span> raised an army of allies and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helots</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span> and marched the length of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>colony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Colonies_in_antiquity</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Amphipolis</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span>, which controlled several nearby silver mines; their product supplied much of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> war fund. <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> was dispatched with a force which arrived too late to stop <span style='color: blue'><b>Brasidas</b></span> capturing <span style='color: blue'><b>Amphipolis</b></span>; <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> was exiled for this, and, as a result, had the conversations with both sides of the war which inspired him to record its history. Both <span style='color: blue'><b>Brasidas</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Cleon</b></span> were killed in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> efforts to retake <span style='color: blue'><b>Amphipolis</b></span> (see Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Amphipolis</b></span>). The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> and Athenians agreed to exchange the hostages for the towns captured by <span style='color: blue'><b>Brasidas</b></span>, and signed a truce.
<br>
<br>With the death of <span style='color: blue'><b>Cleon</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Brasidas</b></span>, zealous war hawks for both nations, the Peace of <span style='color: blue'><b>Nicias</b></span> was able to last for some six years. However, it was a time of constant skirmishing in and around the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>. While the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> refrained from action themselves, some of their allies began to talk of revolt. They were supported in this by <span style='color: blue'><b>Argos</b></span>, a powerful state within the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span> that had remained independent of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lacedaemon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sparta</b></span>. With the support of the Athenians, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Argives</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Argos</b></span> succeeded in forging a coalition of democratic states within the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>, including the powerful states of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mantinea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mantineia</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Elis</b></span>. Early Spartan attempts to break up the coalition failed, and the leadership of the Spartan king <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Agis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Agis_II</b></span> was called into question. Emboldened, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Argives</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Argos</b></span> and their allies, with the support of a small <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> force under <span style='color: blue'><b>Alcibiades</b></span>, moved to seize the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Tegea</b></span>, near <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mantinea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mantineia</b></span> was the largest land <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> fought within <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> during the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lacedaemonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sparta</b></span>, with their neighbors the Tegeans, faced the combined armies of <span style='color: blue'><b>Argos</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mantinea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mantineia</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Arcadia</b></span>. In the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, the allied coalition scored early successes, but failed to capitalize on them, which allowed the Spartan <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>elite forces</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Special_forces</b></span> to defeat the forces opposite them. The result was a complete victory for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, which rescued their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> from the brink of strategic defeat. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democratic alliance</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Democratic_Alliance_of_Chile</b></span> was broken up, and most of its members were reincorporated into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_League</b></span>. With its victory at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mantinea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mantineia</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> pulled itself back from the brink of utter defeat, and re-established its <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hegemony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hegemony</b></span> throughout the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>.
<br>
<br>In the 17th year of the war, word came to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> that one of their distant allies in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicily</b></span> was under attack from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Syracuse</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Syracuse_Orange_football</b></span>. The people of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Syracuse</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Syracuse_Orange_football</b></span> were ethnically <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dorian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dorians</b></span> (as were the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>), while the Athenians, and their ally in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sicilia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sicily</b></span>, were <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span>. The Athenians felt obliged to assist their ally.
<br>
<br>The Athenians did not act solely from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>altruism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Altruism</b></span>: rallied on by <span style='color: blue'><b>Alcibiades</b></span>, the leader of the expedition, they held visions of conquering all of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicily</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Syracuse</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Syracuse_Orange_football</b></span>, the principal <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicily</b></span>, was not much smaller than <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, and conquering all of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicily</b></span> would have brought <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> an immense amount of resources. In the final stages of the preparations for departure, the hermai (religious statues) of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> were mutilated by unknown persons, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Alcibiades</b></span> was charged with religious crimes. <span style='color: blue'><b>Alcibiades</b></span> demanded that he be put on trial at once, so that he might defend himself before the expedition. The Athenians however allowed <span style='color: blue'><b>Alcibiades</b></span> to go on the expedition without being tried (many believed in order to better plot against him). After arriving in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicily</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Alcibiades</b></span> was recalled to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> for trial. Fearing that he would be unjustly condemned, <span style='color: blue'><b>Alcibiades</b></span> defected to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Nicias</b></span> was placed in charge of the mission. After his defection, <span style='color: blue'><b>Alcibiades</b></span> claimed to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> that the Athenians planned to use <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicily</b></span> as a springboard for the conquest of all of Italy and <span style='color: blue'><b>Carthage</b></span>, and to use the resources and soldiers from these new conquests to conquer the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> force consisted of over 100 ships and some 5,000 infantry and light-armored troops. Cavalry was limited to about 30 horses, which proved to be no match for the large and highly trained <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Syracusan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Syracuse,_Sicily</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>. Upon landing in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicily</b></span>, several cities immediately joined the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> cause. Instead of attacking at once, <span style='color: blue'><b>Nicias</b></span> procrastinated and the campaigning season of 415 BC ended with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Syracuse</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Syracuse_Orange_football</b></span> scarcely damaged. With winter approaching, the Athenians were then forced to withdraw into their quarters, and they spent the winter gathering allies and preparing to destroy <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Syracuse</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Syracuse_Orange_football</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The delay</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Delay</b></span> allowed the Syracusans to send for help from <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, who sent their general <span style='color: blue'><b>Gylippus</b></span> to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicily</b></span> with reinforcements. Upon arriving, he raised up a force from several <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sicilian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sicily</b></span> cities, and went to the relief of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Syracuse</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Syracuse_Orange_football</b></span>. He took command of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Syracusan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Syracuse,_Sicily</b></span> troops, and in a series of battles defeated the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> forces, and prevented them from invading the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Nicias</b></span> then sent word to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> asking for reinforcements. <span style='color: blue'><b>Demosthenes</b></span> was chosen and led another fleet to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicily</b></span>, joining his forces with those of <span style='color: blue'><b>Nicias</b></span>. More battles ensued and again, the Syracusans and their allies defeated the Athenians. <span style='color: blue'><b>Demosthenes</b></span> argued for a retreat to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, but <span style='color: blue'><b>Nicias</b></span> at first refused. After additional setbacks, <span style='color: blue'><b>Nicias</b></span> seemed to agree to a retreat until a bad <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>omen</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Omen</b></span>, in the form of a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>lunar</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Moon</b></span> eclipse, delayed any withdrawal. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The delay</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Delay</b></span> was costly and forced the Athenians into a major sea <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> in the Great Harbor of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Syracuse</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Syracuse_Orange_football</b></span>. The Athenians were thoroughly defeated. <span style='color: blue'><b>Nicias</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Demosthenes</b></span> marched their remaining forces inland in search of friendly allies. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Syracusan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Syracuse,_Sicily</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> rode them down mercilessly, eventually killing or enslaving all who were left of the mighty <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> fleet.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lacedaemonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sparta</b></span> were not content with simply sending aid to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicily</b></span>; they also resolved to take the war to the Athenians. On the advice of <span style='color: blue'><b>Alcibiades</b></span>, they fortified <span style='color: blue'><b>Decelea</b></span>, near <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, and prevented the Athenians from making use of their land year round. The fortification of <span style='color: blue'><b>Decelea</b></span> prevented the shipment of supplies overland to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, and forced all supplies to be brought in by sea at increased expense. Perhaps worst of all, the nearby silver mines were totally disrupted, with as many as 20,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> slaves freed by the Spartan <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Decelea</b></span>. With the treasury and emergency <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>reserve</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Military_reserve</b></span> fund of 1,000 talents dwindling away, the Athenians were forced to demand even more tribute from her subject allies, further increasing tensions and the threat of further rebellion within the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Corinth</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, and others in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_League</b></span> sent more reinforcements to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Syracuse</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Syracuse_Orange_football</b></span>, in the hopes of driving off the Athenians; but instead of withdrawing, the Athenians sent another hundred ships and another 5,000 troops to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicily</b></span>. Under <span style='color: blue'><b>Gylippus</b></span>, the Syracusans and their allies were able to decisively defeat the Athenians on land; and <span style='color: blue'><b>Gylippus</b></span> encouraged the Syracusans to build a navy, which was able to defeat the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> fleet when they attempted to withdraw. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> army, attempting to withdraw overland to other, more friendly <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sicilian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sicily</b></span> cities, was divided and defeated; the entire <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> fleet was destroyed, and virtually the entire <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> army was sold off into <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>slavery</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Slavery</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Following the defeat of the Athenians in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicily</b></span>, it was widely believed that the end of the Athenian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> was at hand. Her treasury was nearly empty, her docks were depleted, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>flower</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Flower</b></span> of her youth was dead or imprisoned in a foreign land. They overestimated the strength of their own empire and the beginning of the end was indeed imminent.
<br>
<br>Following the destruction of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sicilian Expedition</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sicilian_Expedition</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lacedaemon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sparta</b></span> encouraged the revolt of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>'s <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tributary</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tribute</b></span> allies, and indeed, much of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> rose in revolt against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>. The Syracusans sent their fleet to the Peloponnesians, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> decided to support the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> with money and ships. Revolt and faction threatened in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> itself.
<br>
<br>The Athenians managed to survive for several reasons. First, their foes were lacking in initiative. <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Syracuse</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Syracuse_Orange_football</b></span> were slow to bring their fleets into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>'s other allies were also slow to furnish troops or ships. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> states that rebelled expected protection, and many <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>rejoined</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Rejoined</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> side. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> were slow to furnish promised funds and ships, frustrating <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> plans.
<br>
<br>At the start of the war, the Athenians had prudently put aside some money and 100 ships that were to be used only as a last resort.
<br>
<br>These ships were then released, and served as the core of the Athenians' fleet throughout the rest of the war. An <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oligarchical</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Oligarchy</b></span> revolution occurred in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, in which a group of 400 seized power. A peace with <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> might have been possible, but the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> fleet, now based on the island of <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span>, refused to accept the change. In 411 BC this fleet engaged the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> at the Battle of Syme. The fleet appointed <span style='color: blue'><b>Alcibiades</b></span> their leader, and continued the war in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>'s name. Their opposition led to the reinstitution of a democratic government in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> within two years.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Alcibiades</b></span>, while condemned as a traitor, still carried weight in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>. He prevented the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> fleet from attacking <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>; instead, he helped restore <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span> by more subtle pressure. He also persuaded the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> fleet to attack the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyzicus</b></span> in 410. In the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, the Athenians obliterated the Spartan fleet, and succeeded in re-establishing the financial basis of the Athenian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Between 410 and 406, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> won a continuous string of victories, and eventually recovered large portions of its empire. All of this was due, in no small part, to <span style='color: blue'><b>Alcibiades</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Faction triumphed in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> following a minor Spartan victory by their skillful general <span style='color: blue'><b>Lysander</b></span> at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>naval battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naval_warfare</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Notium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Notium</b></span> in 406 BC. <span style='color: blue'><b>Alcibiades</b></span> was not re-elected general by the Athenians and he exiled himself from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>. He would never again lead Athenians in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> was then victorious at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>naval battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naval_warfare</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Arginusae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Arginusae</b></span>. The Spartan fleet under <span style='color: blue'><b>Callicratidas</b></span> lost 70 ships and the Athenians lost 25 ships. But, due to bad weather, the Athenians were unable to rescue their stranded crews or to finish off the Spartan fleet. Despite their victory, these failures caused outrage in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and led to a controversial trial. The trial resulted in the execution of six of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>’s top naval commanders. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>’s naval supremacy would now be challenged without several of its most able military leaders and a demoralized navy.
<br>
<br>Unlike some of his predecessors the new Spartan general, <span style='color: blue'><b>Lysander</b></span>, was not a member of the Spartan royal families and was also <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>formidable</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Formidable-class_frigate</b></span> in naval strategy; he was an artful <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>diplomat</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Diplomacy</b></span>, who had even cultivated good personal relationships with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> prince <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Younger</b></span>, the son of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_II</b></span>. Seizing its opportunity, the Spartan fleet sailed at once to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span>, the source of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>' grain. Threatened with starvation, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> fleet had no choice but to follow. Through cunning strategy, <span style='color: blue'><b>Lysander</b></span> totally defeated the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> fleet, in 405 BC, at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegospotami</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Aegospotami</b></span>, destroying 168 ships and capturing some three or four thousand <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> sailors. Only 12 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> ships escaped, and several of these sailed to <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyprus</b></span>, carrying the "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>strategos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Strategos</b></span>" (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>General</span> <span style='color: green'><b>General_officer</b></span>) <span style='color: blue'><b>Conon</b></span>, who was anxious not to face the judgment of the Assembly.
<br>
<br>Facing starvation and disease from the prolonged <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> surrendered in 404 BC, and its allies soon surrendered as well. The democrats at <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span>, loyal to the bitter last, held on slightly longer, and were allowed to flee with their lives. The surrender stripped <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> of its walls, its fleet, and all of its overseas possessions. <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia</b></span> demanded that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> should be destroyed and all its citizens should be enslaved. However, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> announced their refusal to destroy a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> that had done a good service at a time of greatest danger to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, and took <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> into their own system. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> was "to have the same friends and enemies" as <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>.[22]
<br>
<br>The overall effect of the war in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> proper was to substitute a Spartan empire for an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> one. After the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegospotami</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Aegospotami</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> took over the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> and kept all of its tribute revenues for itself; <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>'s allies, who had made greater sacrifices for the war effort than had <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, got nothing.[1]
<br>
<br>For a short period of time, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> was ruled by the "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thirty Tyrants</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thirty_Tyrants</b></span>", and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span> was suspended. This was a reactionary regime set up by <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>. In 403 BC, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oligarchs</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Oligarchy</b></span> were overthrown and a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span> was restored by <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrasybulus</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Although the power of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> was broken, it made something of a recovery as a result of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corinthian_War</b></span> and continued to play an active role in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> politics. <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> was later humbled by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia</b></span> at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leuctra</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Leuctra</b></span> in 371 BC, but the rivalry between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> was brought to an end a few decades later when <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Philip II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Philip_II_of_Macedon</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span> conquered all of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> except <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>
