<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>: Ὁπλιτης) were citizen-soldiers of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> city-states who were primarily armed with spears and shields. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> soldiers utilized the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a> in order to be effective in war with fewer soldiers. The formation discouraged the soldiers from acting alone, for this would compromise the formation and minimize its strengths.[1] The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> were primarily represented by free citizens—propertied farmers and artisans—who were able to afford the bronze armour suit and weapons (estimated at a third to a half of its able-bodied adult male population).[2] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> were not professional soldiers and often lacked sufficient military training. Although some states did maintain a small elite professional unit, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> soldiers were relied on heavily and made up the bulk of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> armies of the time.[3]
<br>
<br>In the 8th or 7th century BC, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> armies adopted a military innovation known as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a>. The formation proved successful in defeating the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> when employed by the Athenians at the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Battle_of_Marathon</a> in 490 BC during the First <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greco-Persian_Wars?lang=en'>Greco-Persian_Wars</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> archers and light troops who fought in the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Battle_of_Marathon</a> failed, because their bows were too weak for their arrows to penetrate the wall of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> shields that made up the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a> was also employed by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> at the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> in 480 BC and at the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Plataea?lang=en'>Battle_of_Plataea</a> in 479 BC during the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greco-Persian_Wars?lang=en'>Greco-Persian_Wars</a>.
<br>
<br>The word <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>: ὁπλίτης hoplitēs; pl. ὁπλῖται hoplitai) derives from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aspis?lang=en'>Aspis</a> (ὅπλον, plural <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hopla?lang=en'>Hopla</a> ὅπλα), the name for the type of shield used by the soldiers. However, the shield was more commonly known as an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aspis?lang=en'>Aspis</a>, so the word <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hopla?lang=en'>Hopla</a> may refer to the soldiers' weapons or even their full armament.[4] In the modern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hellenic_Army?lang=en'>Hellenic_Army</a>, the word <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>: oπλίτης) is used to refer to an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infantry?lang=en'>Infantry</a>.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> shown in two attack positions, with both an overhand and underhand thrust
<br>The fragmented political structure of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>, with many competing city-states, increased the frequency of conflict, but at the same time limited the scale of warfare. Limited manpower did not allow most <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> city-states to form large armies which could operate for long periods because they were generally not formed from professional soldiers. Most soldiers had careers as farmers or workers and returned to these professions after the campaign. All <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> were expected to take part in any military campaign when called for duty by leaders of the state. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> citizens of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> were renowned for their lifelong combat training and almost mythical military prowess, while their greatest adversaries, the Athenians, were exempted from service only after the 60th year of their lives. This inevitably reduced the potential duration of campaigns and often resulted in the campaign season being restricted to one summer.
<br>
<br>Armies generally marched directly to their destination, and in some cases the battlefield was agreed to by the contestants in advance. Battles were fought on level ground, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> preferred to fight with high terrain on both sides of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a> so the formation could not be flanked. An example of this was the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a>, where the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> specifically chose a narrow coastal pass to make their stand against the massive <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> army. The vastly outnumbered <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> held off the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> for seven days.
<br>
<br>When battles occurred, they were usually set piece and intended to be decisive. The battlefield would be flat and open to facilitate <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a> warfare. These battles were usually short and required a high degree of discipline. At least in the early <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_antiquity?lang=en'>Classical_antiquity</a> period, when <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>Cavalry</a> was present, its role was restricted to protection of the flanks of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a>, pursuit of a defeated enemy, and covering a retreat if required. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Light_infantry?lang=en'>Light_infantry</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Projectile?lang=en'>Projectile</a> troops took part in the battles but their role was less important. Before the opposing phalanxes engaged, the light troops would skirmish with the enemy's light forces, and then protect the flanks and rear of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a>.
<br>
<br>The military structure created by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> was a rectangular <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a>. The formation was organized from eight to ten rows deep and could cover a front of a quarter of a mile or more if sufficient <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> were available. The two lines would close to a short distance to allow effective use of their spears, while the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Psiloi?lang=en'>Psiloi</a> threw stones and javelins from behind their lines. The shields would clash and the first lines (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Protostates?lang=en'>Protostates</a>) would stab at their opponents, at the same time trying to keep in position. The ranks behind them would support them with their own spears and the mass of their shields gently pushing them, not to force them into the enemy formation but to keep them steady and in place. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Soldiers?lang=en'>The_Soldiers</a> in the back provided motivation to the ranks in the front being that most <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> were close community members. At certain points, a command would be given to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a> or a part thereof to collectively take a certain number of steps forward (ranging from half to multiple steps). This was the famed othismos.[5]
<br>
<br>At this point, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a> would put its collective weight to push back the enemy line and thus create fear and panic among its ranks. There could be multiple such instances of attempts to push, but it seems from the accounts of the ancients that these were perfectly orchestrated and attempted organized en masse. Once one of the lines broke, the troops would generally flee from the field, sometimes chased by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Psiloi?lang=en'>Psiloi</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peltast?lang=en'>Peltast</a>, or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Light_cavalry?lang=en'>Light_cavalry</a>.
<br>
<br>If a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> escaped, he would sometimes be forced to drop his cumbersome <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aspis?lang=en'>Aspis</a>, thereby disgracing himself to his friends and family (becoming a ripsaspis, one who threw his shield).[6] To lessen the amount of casualties inflicted by the enemy during battles, soldiers were positioned to stand shoulder to shoulder with their <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aspis?lang=en'>Aspis</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a>' most prominent citizens and generals led from the front. Thus, the whole war could be decided by a single field <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a>; victory was enforced by ransoming the fallen back to the defeated, called the "Custom of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>".
<br>
<br>Individual <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> carried their shields on their left arm, protecting not only themselves but also the soldier to the left. This meant that the men at the extreme right of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a> were only half-protected. In <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a>, opposing phalanxes would exploit this weakness by attempting to overlap the enemy's right flank.[7] It also meant that, in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a>, a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a> would tend to drift to the right (as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> sought to remain behind the shield of their neighbour). The most experienced <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> were often placed on the right side of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a>, to counteract these problems. According to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a>'s Sayings of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a>, "a man carried a shield for the sake of the whole line".[8]
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a> is an example of a military formation in which single combat and other individualistic forms of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a> were suppressed for the good of the whole. In earlier Homeric, dark age combat, the words and deeds of supremely powerful heroes turned the tide of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a>. Instead of having individual heroes, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> warfare relied heavily on the community and unity of soldiers. With friends and family pushing on either side and enemies forming a solid wall of shields in front, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> had little opportunity for feats of technique and weapon skill, but great need for commitment and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mental_toughness?lang=en'>Mental_toughness</a>. By forming a human wall to provide a powerful defensive armour, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> became much more effective while taking fewer casualties. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> had much discipline and were taught to be loyal and trustworthy. They had to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trust_law?lang=en'>Trust_law</a> their neighbours for mutual protection, so a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a> was only as strong as its weakest elements. Its effectiveness depended on how well the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> could maintain this formation while in combat, and how well they could stand their ground, especially when engaged against another <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a>. The more disciplined and courageous the army, the more likely it was to win—often engagements between the various city-states of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> would be resolved by one side fleeing after their <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a> had broken formation.

The helmet on the upper left is a restored version of the oxidised helmet on the right.
<br>Body armour[edit]
<br>Each <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> provided his own equipment. Thus, only those who could afford such weaponry fought as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a>; as with the Roman <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Second_Spanish_Republic?lang=en'>Second_Spanish_Republic</a> army it was the middle classes who formed the bulk of the infantry. Equipment was not standardized, although there were doubtless trends in general designs over time, and between city-states. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> had customized armour, the shield was decorated with family or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clan?lang=en'>Clan</a> emblems, although in later years these were replaced by symbols or monograms of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> states. The equipment might well be passed down in families, since it would have been expensive to manufacture.
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> army consisted of heavily armoured infantrymen. Their armour, also called panoply, was made of full bronze, weighing nearly 32 kilograms (70 lb). The average farmer-peasant <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> typically wore no armour, carrying only a shield, a spear, and perhaps a helmet plus a secondary weapon.The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Linothorax?lang=en'>Linothorax</a> was the most popular type armour worn by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a>, since it was cost-effective and provided decent protection. The richer upper-class <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> typically had a bronze <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cuirass?lang=en'>Cuirass</a> of either the bell or muscled variety, a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bronze_Helmet_(Poland)?lang=en'>Bronze_Helmet_(Poland)</a> with cheekplates, as well as greaves and other armour. The design of the helmets used varied through time. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinthian_helmet?lang=en'>Corinthian_helmet</a> was at first standardized and was a very successful design. Later variants included the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chalcidian_helmet?lang=en'>Chalcidian_helmet</a>, a lightened version of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinthian_helmet?lang=en'>Corinthian_helmet</a>, and the very simple <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pileus_(hat)?lang=en'>Pileus_(hat)</a> helmet worn by the later <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a>. Often the helmet was decorated with one, sometimes more <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horsehair?lang=en'>Horsehair</a> crests, and/or bronze animal horns and ears. Helmets were often painted as well. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phrygian_helmet?lang=en'>Phrygian_helmet</a> had a large visor to further increase protection. In later periods, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Linen?lang=en'>Linen</a> breastplates called <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Linothorax?lang=en'>Linothorax</a> were used, as they were tougher and cheaper to make. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Linen?lang=en'>Linen</a> was 0.5-<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Centimetre?lang=en'>Centimetre</a> (0.20 in) thick.
<br>
<br>By contrast with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a>, other contemporary infantry (e.g., <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>) tended to wear relatively light armour, use wicker shields, and were armed with shorter spears, javelins, and bows. The most famous are the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peltast?lang=en'>Peltast</a>, light-armed troops who wore no armour and were armed with a light shield, javelins and a short <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gladius?lang=en'>Gladius</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> general <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iphicrates?lang=en'>Iphicrates</a> developed a new type of armour and arms for his <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mercenary?lang=en'>Mercenary</a> army, which included light <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Linen?lang=en'>Linen</a> armour, smaller shields and longer spears, whilst arming his <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peltast?lang=en'>Peltast</a> with larger shields, helmets and a longer spear, thus enabling them to defend themselves more easily against enemy <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a>. With this new type of army he defeated a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> in 392 BC. Nevertheless, most <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> stuck to the traditional arms and armour.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> carried a large concave shield called an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aspis?lang=en'>Aspis</a> (often referred to as a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aspis?lang=en'>Aspis</a>), measuring between 80–100 centimetres (31–39 in) in diameter and weighing between 6.5–8 kilograms (14–18 lbs).[9][10] This large shield was made possible partly by its shape, which allowed it to be supported on the shoulder. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aspis?lang=en'>Aspis</a> shield was put together in three layers: the center layer was made of thick <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wood?lang=en'>Wood</a>, the outside layer facing the enemy was made of bronze, and leather made up the inside of the shield. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Revolution?lang=en'>Revolution</a> part of the shield was, in fact, the grip. Known as an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Argos?lang=en'>Argos</a> grip, it placed the handle at the edge of the shield, and was supported by a leather fastening (for the forearm) at the centre. These two points of contact eliminated the possibility of the shield swaying to the side after being struck, and as a result soldiers rarely lost their shields. This allowed the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> soldier more mobility with the shield, as well as the ability to capitalize on its offensive capabilities and better support the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a>. The large <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aspis?lang=en'>Aspis</a> shields, designed for pushing ahead, were the most essential equipment for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a>.[11]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a>. Print from Vinkhuijzen Collection of Military Costume Illustration.
<br>The main offensive weapon used was a 2.4–4.5-metre (7.9–14.8 ft) long and 2.5-<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Centimetre?lang=en'>Centimetre</a> (1 in) in diameter spear called a doru, or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dory?lang=en'>Dory</a>. It was held with the right hand, with the left hand holding the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a>'s shield. Soldiers usually held their spears in an underhand position when approaching but once they came into close contact with their opponents, they were held in an overhand position ready to strike. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Spearhead?lang=en'>The_Spearhead</a> was usually a curved leaf shape, while the rear of the spear had a spike called a sauroter ("lizard-killer") which was used to stand the spear in the ground (hence the name). It was also used as a secondary weapon if the main shaft snapped, or for the rear ranks to finish off fallen opponents as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a> advanced over them. In addition to being used as a secondary weapon, the sauroter also doubled to balance the spear, but not for throwing purposes. It is a matter of contention, among historians, whether the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> used the spear overarm or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Axilla?lang=en'>Axilla</a>. Held <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Axilla?lang=en'>Axilla</a>, the thrusts would have been less powerful but under more control, and vice versa. It seems likely that both motions were used, depending on the situation. If attack was called for, an overarm motion was more likely to break through an opponent's defence. The upward thrust is more easily deflected by armour due to its lesser leverage. However, when defending, an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Axilla?lang=en'>Axilla</a> carry absorbed more shock and could be 'couched' under the shoulder for maximum stability. It should also be said that an overarm motion would allow more effective combination of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aspis?lang=en'>Aspis</a> and doru if the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shield_wall?lang=en'>Shield_wall</a> had broken down, while the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Axilla?lang=en'>Axilla</a> motion would be more effective when the shield had to be interlocked with those of one's neighbours in the battle-line. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> in the rows behind the lead would almost certainly have made overarm thrusts. The rear ranks held their spears <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Axilla?lang=en'>Axilla</a>, and raised their shields upwards at increasing angles. This was an effective defence against missiles, deflecting their force.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> also carried a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gladius?lang=en'>Gladius</a>, mostly a short <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gladius?lang=en'>Gladius</a> called a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xiphos?lang=en'>Xiphos</a>, but later also longer and heavier types. The short <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gladius?lang=en'>Gladius</a> was a secondary weapon, used if or when their spears were broken or lost, or if the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a> broke rank. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xiphos?lang=en'>Xiphos</a> usually had a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sword?lang=en'>Sword</a> around 60 centimetres (24 in) long; however, those used by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> were often only 30–45 centimetres long. This very short <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xiphos?lang=en'>Xiphos</a> would be very <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Advantageous?lang=en'>Advantageous</a> in the press that occurred when two lines of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> met, capable of being thrust through gaps in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shield_wall?lang=en'>Shield_wall</a> into an enemy's unprotected groin or throat, while there was no room to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Swing_bowling?lang=en'>Swing_bowling</a> a longer <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gladius?lang=en'>Gladius</a>. Such a small weapon would be particularly useful after many <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> had started to abandon <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Body_armor?lang=en'>Body_armor</a> during the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_War</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> could also alternatively carry the kopis, a heavy knife with a forward-curving <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sword?lang=en'>Sword</a>.
<br>
<br>Dark age warfare transitioned into <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> warfare in the 8th century BC. Historians and researchers have debated the reason and speed of the transition for centuries. So far 3 popular theories exist:
<br>
<br>Developed by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anthony_Snodgrass?lang=en'>Anthony_Snodgrass</a>, the Gradualist Theory states that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> style of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a> developed in a series of steps as a result of innovations in armour and weaponry.[12] Chronologically dating the archeological findings of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> armour and using the findings to approximate the development of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a>, Snodgrass claims that the transition took approximately 100 years to complete from 750–650 BC.[13] The progression of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a> took time because as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a> matured it required denser formations that made the elite warriors recruit <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> citizens.[14] The large amounts of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> armour needed to then be distributed to the populations of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> citizens only increased the time for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a> to be implemented. Snodgrass believes, only once the armour was in place that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a> became popular.[13]
<br>
<br>The Rapid Adaptation model was developed by historians <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Cartledge?lang=en'>Paul_Cartledge</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Handley_Page_Victor?lang=en'>Handley_Page_Victor</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tommy_Hanson?lang=en'>Tommy_Hanson</a>.[15] The historians believe that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a> was created individually by military forces, but was so effective that others had to immediately adapt their way of war to combat the formation.[15] Rapid <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adoptionism?lang=en'>Adoptionism</a> propose that the double grip, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aspis?lang=en'>Aspis</a> shield that was required for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a> was so constricting in mobility that once it was introduced, dark age, free flowing warfare was inadequate to fight against the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> only escalating the speed of the transition.[12] Quickly, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> armour became widely used throughout <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_Cartledge?lang=en'>Frank_Cartledge</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tommy_Hanson?lang=en'>Tommy_Hanson</a> estimate the transition took place from 725–675 BC.[15]
<br>
<br>Developed by Hans <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Van?lang=en'>Van</a> Wees, the Extended Gradualist theory is the most lengthy of the three popular transition theories. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Van?lang=en'>Van</a> Wees depicts <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iconography?lang=en'>Iconography</a> found on pots of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_Dark_Ages?lang=en'>Greek_Dark_Ages</a> believing that the foundation of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a> was birthed during this time.[12] Specifically, he uses an example of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chigi_vase?lang=en'>Chigi_vase</a> to point out that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> soldiers were carrying normal spears as well as javelins on their backs. Matured <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> did not carry long range weapons including javelins.[13] The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chigi_vase?lang=en'>Chigi_vase</a> is important for our knowledge of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> soldier because it is one, if not the only one representation of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> formation, known as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a>, in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greek_art?lang=en'>Ancient_Greek_art</a>.[16] This led <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Van?lang=en'>Van</a> Wees to believe that there was a transitional period from long <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Range_Warfare?lang=en'>Range_Warfare</a> of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_Dark_Ages?lang=en'>Greek_Dark_Ages</a> to the close combat of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> warfare. Some other evidence of a transitional period lies within the text of Spartan Poet <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tyrtaeus?lang=en'>Tyrtaeus</a>, when he wrote, "…will they draw back for the pounding [of the missiles, no,] despite the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artillery_battery?lang=en'>Artillery_battery</a> of great hurl-stones, the helmets shall abide the rattle [of war unbowed]".[17] At no point in future texts does <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tyrtaeus?lang=en'>Tyrtaeus</a> involve any talk of missiles or rocks making another case for a transitional period. Extended Gradualists argue that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> warriors did not fight in a true <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a> until the 5th century BC.[12] Making estimations of the speed of the transition reached as long as 300 years, from 750–450 BC.
<br>
<br>The exact time when <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> warfare was developed is uncertain, the prevalent theory being that it was established sometime during the 8th or 7th century BC, when the "heroic age was abandoned and a far more disciplined system introduced" and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Argos?lang=en'>Argos</a> shield became popular.[18] Peter Krentz argues that "the ideology of hoplitic warfare as a ritualized contest developed not in the 7th century [BC], but only after 480, when non-hoplite arms began to be excluded from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a>".[19] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anagnostis_Agelarakis?lang=en'>Anagnostis_Agelarakis</a>, based on recent archaeo-anthropological discoveries of the earliest monumental polyandrion (communal burial of male warriors) at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paros?lang=en'>Paros</a> Island in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>, unveils a last quarter of the 8th century BC date for a hoplitic phalangeal military organization.[20]
<br>
<br>The rise and fall of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> warfare was tied to the rise and fall of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polis?lang=en'>Polis</a>. As discussed above, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> were a solution to the armed clashes between independent city-states. As <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> civilization found itself confronted by the world at large, particularly the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>, the emphasis in warfare shifted. Confronted by huge numbers of enemy troops, individual city-states could not realistically fight alone. During the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greco-Persian_Wars?lang=en'>Greco-Persian_Wars</a> (499–448 BC), alliances between groups of cities (whose composition varied over time) fought against the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>. This drastically altered the scale of warfare and the numbers of troops involved. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a> proved itself far superior to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> infantry at such conflicts as the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Battle_of_Marathon</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a>, and the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Plataea?lang=en'>Battle_of_Plataea</a>.
<br>
<br>
<br>Crouching warrior, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tondo_(art)?lang=en'>Tondo_(art)</a> of an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Black-figure_pottery?lang=en'>Black-figure_pottery</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kylix?lang=en'>Kylix</a>, c. 560 BC (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Staatliche_Antikensammlungen?lang=en'>Staatliche_Antikensammlungen</a>)
<br>During this period, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> rose to a position of political eminence in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>, and their rivalry in the aftermath of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> wars brought <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> into renewed internal conflict. However, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_War</a> was on a scale unlike conflicts before. Fought between leagues of cities, dominated by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> respectively, the pooled manpower and financial resources allowed a diversification of warfare. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> warfare was in decline; there were three major battles in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_War</a>, and none proved decisive. Instead there was increased reliance on navies, skirmishers, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mercenary?lang=en'>Mercenary</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> walls, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Siege?lang=en'>Siege</a> engines, and non-set piece tactics. These reforms made wars of attrition possible and greatly increased the number of casualties. In the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> war, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> faced large numbers of skirmishers and missile-armed troops, and such troops (e.g., <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peltast?lang=en'>Peltast</a>) became much more commonly used by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> during the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_War</a>. As a result, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> began wearing less armour, carrying shorter swords, and in general adapting for greater mobility; this led to the development of the ekdromos light <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a>.
<br>
<br>Many famous personalities, philosophers, artists, and poets fought as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a>.[21][22]
<br>
<br>According to Nefiodkin, fighting against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heavy_infantry?lang=en'>Heavy_infantry</a> during the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greco-Persian_Wars?lang=en'>Greco-Persian_Wars</a> inspired the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> to introduce scythed chariots.[23]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> is one of the most famous city-states, along with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, which had a unique position in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>. Contrary to other <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> states, the free citizens of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> served as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> their entire life, training and exercising also in peacetime, which gave <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> a professional <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Standing_army?lang=en'>Standing_army</a>. Although small, numbering no more than 1,500 to 2,000 men,[citation needed] divided into six <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/South_African_contract_law?lang=en'>South_African_contract_law</a> or battalions, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> was feared for its discipline and ferocity. Military service was the primary duty of Spartan men, and Spartan society was organized around its army.

<br>Military service for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> lasted until the age of 40, and sometimes even until 60 years of age, depending on a man's physical ability to perform on the battlefield.
<br>
<br>Later on in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> era, more sophisticated tactics were developed, in particular by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theban_hegemony?lang=en'>Theban_hegemony</a> general <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epaminondas?lang=en'>Epaminondas</a>. These tactics inspired the future king <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_II_of_Macedon?lang=en'>Philip_II_of_Macedon</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Macedonia?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Macedonia</a>, who was at the time a hostage in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia?lang=en'>Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia</a>, and also inspired the development of new kind of infantry, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Macedonian_army?lang=en'>Ancient_Macedonian_army</a>. After the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Macedonians?lang=en'>Ancient_Macedonians</a> conquests of the 4th century BC, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> was slowly abandoned in favour of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Macedonian_phalanx?lang=en'>Macedonian_phalanx</a>, armed in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Macedonians?lang=en'>Ancient_Macedonians</a> fashion, in the armies of the southern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> states. Although clearly a development of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Macedonian_army?lang=en'>Ancient_Macedonian_army</a> was tactically more versatile, especially used in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Combined_arms?lang=en'>Combined_arms</a> tactics favoured by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Macedonians?lang=en'>Ancient_Macedonians</a>. These forces defeated the last major <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> army, at the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaeronea?lang=en'>Chaeronea</a> (338 BC), after which <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> and its allies joined the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Macedonia_(ancient_kingdom)?lang=en'>Macedonia_(ancient_kingdom)</a>.
<br>
<br>While <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great?lang=en'>Alexander_the_Great</a>'s army mainly fielded <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pezhetairos?lang=en'>Pezhetairos</a> (= Foot Companions) as his main force, it is known that his army also included some classic <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a>, either provided by the League of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a> or from hired <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mercenary?lang=en'>Mercenary</a>. Beside these units, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Macedonians?lang=en'>Ancient_Macedonians</a> also used the so-called <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hypaspists?lang=en'>Hypaspists</a>, an elite force of units possibly originally fighting as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> and used to guard the exposed right wing of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great?lang=en'>Alexander_the_Great</a>'s <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a>.
<br>
<br>Hoplite-style warfare was very influential and influenced several other nations in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mediterranean_Sea?lang=en'>Mediterranean_Sea</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> warfare was the dominant fighting style on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italian_Peninsula?lang=en'>Italian_Peninsula</a> up to the early 3rd century BC, employed by both the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Etruscan_civilization?lang=en'>Etruscan_civilization</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Early_Roman_army?lang=en'>Early_Roman_army</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Republic?lang=en'>Roman_Republic</a> later changed their fighting style to a more flexible <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maniple_(military_unit)?lang=en'>Maniple_(military_unit)</a> organization, which was more versatile on rough terrain like that of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samnium?lang=en'>Samnium</a>. Roman equipment also changed, and they reequipped their soldiers with longer oval shields (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scute?lang=en'>Scute</a>), swords and heavy javelins (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pilum?lang=en'>Pilum</a>). In the end only the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triarii?lang=en'>Triarii</a> would keep a long spear (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nakshatra?lang=en'>Nakshatra</a>) as their main weapon. However, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triarii?lang=en'>Triarii</a> would still fight in a traditional <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a>. Though the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kingdom_of_Italy?lang=en'>Kingdom_of_Italy</a> tribes, namely the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Socii?lang=en'>Socii</a> fighting with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Republic?lang=en'>Roman_Republic</a>, later adopted the new Roman fighting style, some continued to fight as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a>. Local levied troops or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mercenary?lang=en'>Mercenary</a> serving under <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pyrrhus_of_Epirus?lang=en'>Pyrrhus_of_Epirus</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epirus?lang=en'>Epirus</a> or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hannibal?lang=en'>Hannibal</a> (namely <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Etruscan_civilization?lang=en'>Etruscan_civilization</a>) were equipped and fought as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a>.
<br>
<br>Early in its history, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Carthage?lang=en'>Ancient_Carthage</a> also equipped its troops as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a>, in units such as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sacred_Band_of_Thebes?lang=en'>Sacred_Band_of_Thebes</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Carthage?lang=en'>Ancient_Carthage</a>. Many <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mercenary?lang=en'>Mercenary</a> also fought in foreign armies, such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Carthage?lang=en'>Ancient_Carthage</a> and Achaemenid <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire?lang=en'>Roman_Empire</a>, where it is believed by some that they inspired the formation of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardaces?lang=en'>Cardaces</a>. Some <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> served under the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Illyrians?lang=en'>Illyrians</a> king <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bardylis?lang=en'>Bardylis</a> in the 4th century. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Illyrians?lang=en'>Illyrians</a> were known to import many weapons and tactics from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>.
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diadochi?lang=en'>Diadochi</a> imported the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a> to their kingdoms. Though they mostly fielded <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> citizens or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mercenary?lang=en'>Mercenary</a>, they also armed and drilled <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Local_Natives?lang=en'>Local_Natives</a> as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> or rather <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Macedonian_army?lang=en'>Ancient_Macedonian_army</a>, like the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Machimoi?lang=en'>Machimoi</a> of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ptolemaic_army?lang=en'>Ptolemaic_army</a>.
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> armies of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hellenistic_period?lang=en'>Hellenistic_period</a> mostly fielded troops in the fashion of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Macedonian_army?lang=en'>Ancient_Macedonian_army</a>. Nonetheless many armies of mainland <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> stuck with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> warfare. Besides <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_antiquity?lang=en'>Classical_antiquity</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hellenistic_period?lang=en'>Hellenistic_period</a> nations began to field two new types of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thyreophoroi?lang=en'>Thyreophoroi</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thorakitai?lang=en'>Thorakitai</a>. They developed when <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> adopted the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Celts?lang=en'>Celts</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thyreos?lang=en'>Thyreos</a> shield, of an oval shape that was similar to the shields of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Republic?lang=en'>Roman_Republic</a>, but flatter. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thyreophoroi?lang=en'>Thyreophoroi</a> were armed with a long thrusting spear, a short <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gladius?lang=en'>Gladius</a> and, if needed, javelins. While the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thorakitai?lang=en'>Thorakitai</a> were similar to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thyreophoroi?lang=en'>Thyreophoroi</a>, they were more heavily armoured, as their name implies, usually wearing a mail shirt. These troops were used as a link between the light infantry and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a>, a form of medium infantry to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bridge?lang=en'>Bridge</a>
