The Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> was the final land <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> during the second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. It took place in 479 BC near the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span>, and was fought between an alliance of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states (including <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Megara</b></span>), and the Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The previous year the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion force, led by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> king in person, had scored victories at the battles of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span> and conquered <span style='color: blue'><b>Thessaly</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Phocis</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>. However, at the ensuing Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek navy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hellenic_Navy</b></span> had won an unlikely but decisive victory, preventing the conquest of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> then retreated with much of his army, leaving his general <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> to finish off the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> the following year.
<br>
<br>In the summer of 479 BC the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> assembled a huge (by ancient standards) army and marched out of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> retreated to <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span> and built a fortified camp near <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, however, refused to be drawn into the prime <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> terrain around the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> camp, resulting in a stalemate that lasted 11 days. While attempting a retreat after their supply lines were disrupted, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> line fragmented. Thinking the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> in full retreat, <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> ordered his forces to pursue them, but the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> (particularly the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, Tegeans and Athenians) halted and gave <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, routing the lightly armed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> infantry and killing <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>.
<br>
<br>A large portion of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army was trapped in its camp and slaughtered. The destruction of this army, and the remnants of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> navy allegedly on the same day at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>, decisively ended the invasion. After <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> allies would take the offensive against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, marking a new phase of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>. Although <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> was in every sense a resounding victory, it does not seem to have been attributed the same significance (even at the time) as, for example, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> victory at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> or the Spartan defeat at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> had supported the unsuccessful <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> against the Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> in 499â€“494 BC. The Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> was still relatively young and prone to revolts by its subject peoples.[1][2] Moreover, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> was an usurper and had to spend considerable time putting down revolts against his rule.[1] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> threatened the integrity of his empire, and he thus vowed to punish those involved (especially those not already part of the empire).[3][4] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> also saw the opportunity to expand his empire into the fractious world of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ancient Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[4]
<br>
<br>A preliminary expedition under <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>, in 492 BC, to secure the land approaches to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> ended with the re-conquest of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span> and forced <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span> to become a fully subordinate <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>client kingdom</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Client_state</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>,[5][6] the latter which had been a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vassal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vassal</b></span> as early as the late 6th century BC.[7] An amphibious task force was then sent out under Datis and <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> in 490 BC, using <span style='color: blue'><b>Delos</b></span> as an intermediate base at, successfully sacking <span style='color: blue'><b>Karystos</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>,[8] before moving to attack <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>. However, at the ensuing Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, the Athenians won a remarkable victory, resulting in the withdrawal of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>.[9]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> therefore began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. However, he died before the invasion could begin.[10] The throne of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> passed to his son <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>, who quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, including building two pontoon bridges across the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span>.[11] In 481 BC, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> sent ambassadors around <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> asking for earth and water as a gesture of their submission, but making the very deliberate omission of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> (both of whom were at open war with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>).[12] Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states. A congress of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> states met at <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>late autumn</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Late_Autumn_(1960_film)</b></span> of 481 BC, and a confederate alliance of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states was formed (hereafter referred to as "the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span>").[13] This was remarkable for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>disjointed</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Disjointed</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> world, especially since many of the city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.[14]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> initially adopted a strategy of blocking land and sea approaches to southern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[15] Thus, in August 480 BC, after hearing of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>' approach, a small <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> army led by Spartan King <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> blocked the Pass of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, while an Athenian-dominated navy sailed to the Straits of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span>. Famously, the massively outnumbered <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army held <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> for three days before being outflanked by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, who used a little-known <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mountain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mountain_warfare</b></span> path.[16] Although much of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army retreated, the rearguard, formed of the Spartan and Thespian contingents, was surrounded and annihilated.[17] The simultaneous Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span>, consisting of a series of naval encounters, was up to that point a stalemate;[18] however, when news of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> reached them, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> also retreated, since holding the straits was now a moot point.[19]
<br>
<br>Following <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army proceeded to burn and sack the Boeotian cities that had not surrendered, <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Thespiae</b></span>, before taking possession of the now-evacuated <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> army, meanwhile, prepared to defend the Isthmus of <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span>.[20] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> wished for a final crushing defeat of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> to finish the conquest of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> in that campaigning season; conversely, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> sought a decisive victory over the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> navy that would guarantee the security of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>.[21] The ensuing naval Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> ended in a decisive victory for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span>, marking a turning point in the conflict.[22]
<br>
<br>Following the defeat of his navy at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> retreated to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> with the bulk of his army. According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, this was because he feared the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> would sail to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> and destroy the pontoon bridges, thereby trapping his army in <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>.[23] He left <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>, with handpicked troops, to complete the conquest of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> the following year.[24] <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> evacuated <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span> and wintered in <span style='color: blue'><b>Thessaly</b></span>;[25] the Athenians then reoccupied their destroyed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>.[22] Over the winter, there seems to have been some tension among the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span>. The Athenians in particular, who were not protected by the Isthmus but whose fleet was the key to the security of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>, felt hard done by and demanded that an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> army march north the following year.[22] When the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> failed to commit to this, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> fleet refused to join the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> navy in the spring. The navy, now under the command of the Spartan king <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leotychides</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leotychidas</b></span>, stationed itself off <span style='color: blue'><b>Delos</b></span>, while the remnants of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet remained off <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span>, both sides unwilling to risk <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>.[26] Similarly, <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> remained in <span style='color: blue'><b>Thessaly</b></span>, knowing an attack on the Isthmus was pointless, while the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> refused to send an army outside the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>.[22]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> moved to break the stalemate by trying to win over the Athenians and their fleet through the mediation of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> I of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span>, offering peace, self-government and territorial expansion.[26] The Athenians made sure that a Spartan delegation was also on hand to hear the offer, and rejected it:
<br>
<br>The degree to which we are put in the shadow by the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>' strength is hardly something you need to bring to our attention. We are already well aware of it. But even so, such is our love of liberty, that we will never surrender.[26]
<br>
<br>Upon this refusal, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> marched south again. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> was again evacuated and left to the enemy. <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> now repeated his offer of peace to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> refugees on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, along with <span style='color: blue'><b>Megara</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>, sent emissaries to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> demanding assistance and threatening to accept the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> terms if it was not given.[27] According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, who were at that time celebrating the festival of Hyacinthus, delayed making a decision until they were persuaded by a guest, Chileos of <span style='color: blue'><b>Tegea</b></span>, who pointed out the danger to all of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> if the Athenians surrendered.[27]When the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> emissaries delivered an ultimatum to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> the next day, they were <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>amazed</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Amazed</b></span> to hear that a task force was in fact already en route; the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartan army</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> was marching to meet the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[28]
<br>
<br>When <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> learned of the Spartan force, he completed the destruction of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, tearing down whatever was left standing.[29] He then retreated towards <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia</b></span>, hoping to lure the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army into territory that would be suitable for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>.[29] <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> created a fortified encampment on the north bank of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Asopus</b></span> river in <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span> covering the ground from <span style='color: blue'><b>Erythrae</b></span> past Hysiae and up to the lands of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>.[30]

<br>The Athenians sent 8,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>, led by Aristides, along with 600 Plataean exiles to join the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> army.[31] The army then marched in <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span> across the passes of Mount <span style='color: blue'><b>Cithaeron</b></span>, arriving near <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>, and above the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> position on the <span style='color: blue'><b>Asopus</b></span>.[32] Under the guidance of the commanding general, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> took up position opposite the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> lines but remained on high ground.[32] Knowing that he had little hope of successfully attacking the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> positions, <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> sought to either sow dissension among the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> or lure them down into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Great_Plains</b></span>.[32] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> reports that a conspiracy was discovered among some prominent Athenians, who were planning to betray the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> cause; although this account is not universally accepted, it may indicate <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>' attempts of intrigue within the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> ranks.[32]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> also initiated hit-and-run <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> attacks against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> lines, possibly trying to lure the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> down to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Great_Plains</b></span> in pursuit.[32] Although having some initial success, this strategy backfired when the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> commander Masistius was killed; with his death, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> retreated.[33]
<br>
<br>Their morale boosted by this small victory, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> moved forward, still remaining on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>higher ground</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sony_Music_Entertainment</b></span>, to a new position more suited for encampment and better watered.[34] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> and Tegeans were on a ridge to the right of the line, the Athenians on a hillock on the left and the other contingents on the slightly lower ground between.[32] In response, <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> brought his men up to the <span style='color: blue'><b>Asopus</b></span> and arrayed them for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>; However, neither the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> nor the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> would attack; <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> claims this is because both sides received bad omens during sacrificial rituals.[35] The armies thus stayed camped in their locations for eight days, during which new <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> troops arrived.[36] <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> then sought to break the stalemate by sending his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> to attack the passes of Mount <span style='color: blue'><b>Cithaeron</b></span>; this raid resulted in the capture of a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>convoy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Convoy</b></span> of provisions intended for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[36] Two more days passed, during which time the supply lines of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> continued to be menaced.[32] <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> then launched another <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> raid on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> lines, which succeeded in blocking the Gargaphian Spring, which had been the only source of water for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army (they could not use the <span style='color: blue'><b>Asopus</b></span> due to the threat posed by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> archers).[37] Coupled with the lack of food, the restriction of the water supply made the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> position untenable, so they decided to retreat to a position in front of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>, from where they could guard the passes and have access to fresh water.[38] To prevent the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> from attacking during the retreat, it was to be performed that night.[38]
<br>
<br>However, the retreat went awry. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> contingents in the centre missed their appointed position and ended up scattered in front of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> itself.[32] The Athenians, Tegeans and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, who had been guarding the rear of the retreat, had not even begun to retreat by daybreak.[32] A single Spartan division was thus left on the ridge to guard the rear, while the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> and Tegeans retreated <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>uphill</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Uphill</b></span>; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span> also instructed the Athenians to begin the retreat and if possible join up with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>.[32][39] However, the Athenians at first retreated directly towards <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>,[39] and thus the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> line remained fragmented as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> camp began to stir.[32]
<br>
<br>According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> sent 45,000 men â€“ 5,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartiates</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartiate</b></span> (full <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>citizen soldiers</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Citizen_Soldiers</b></span>), 5,000 other Lacodaemonian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>perioeci</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Perioeci</b></span>) and 35,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helots</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span> (seven per <span style='color: blue'><b>Spartiate</b></span>).[31] This was probably the largest Spartan force ever assembled.[32] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army had been reinforced by contingents of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> from the other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> city-states, as shown in the table. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Diodorus Siculus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Diodorus_Siculus</b></span> claims in his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bibliotheca historica</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bibliotheca_historica</b></span> that the number of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> troops approached one hundred thousand.[40]
<br>
<br>According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, there were a total of 69,500 lightly armed troops â€“ 35,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helots</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span>[41] and 34,500 troops from the rest of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>; roughly one per <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>.[41] The number of 34,500 has been suggested to represent one light <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>skirmisher</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Skirmisher</b></span> supporting each non-Spartan <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> (33,700), together with 800 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> archers, whose presence in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> later notes.[42] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> tells us that there were also 1,800 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thespians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thespiae</b></span> (but does not say how they were equipped), giving a total strength of 108,200 men.[43]
<br>
<br>The number of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> is accepted as reasonable (and possible); the Athenians alone had fielded 10,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>.[32] Some historians have accepted the number of light troops and used them as a population <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>census</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Census_of_Quirinius</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> at the time. Certainly these numbers are theoretically possible. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, for instance, allegedly fielded a fleet of 180 triremes at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>,[44] manned by approximately 36,000 rowers and fighters.[45] Thus 69,500 light troops could easily have been sent to <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>. Nevertheless, the number of light troops is often rejected as exaggerated, especially in view of the ratio of seven <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helots</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span> to one <span style='color: blue'><b>Spartiate</b></span>.[32] For instance, Lazenby accepts that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> from other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities might have been accompanied by one lightly armoured retainer each, but rejects the number of seven <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helots</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span> per <span style='color: blue'><b>Spartiate</b></span>.[46] He further speculates that each <span style='color: blue'><b>Spartiate</b></span> was accompanied by one armed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helot</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span>, and that the remaining <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helots</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span> were employed in the logistical effort, transporting food for the army.[46] Both Lazenby and <span style='color: blue'><b>Holland</b></span> deem the lightly armed troops, whatever their number, as essentially irrelevant to the outcome of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>.[46][47]
<br>
<br>A further complication is that a certain proportion of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> manpower was needed to man the fleet, which amounted to at least 110 triremes, and thus approximately 22,000 men.[48] Since the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span> was fought at least near-simultaneously with the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>, then this was a pool of manpower which could not have contributed to <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>, and further reduces the likelihood that 110,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> assembled before <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>.[49]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> forces were, as agreed by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> congress, under the overall command of Spartan royalty in the person of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span>, who was the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>regent</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Regent</b></span> for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>' young son, <span style='color: blue'><b>Pleistarchus</b></span>, his cousin. Diodorus tells us that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> contingent was under the command of Aristides;[50] it is probable that the other contingents also had their leaders. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> tells us in several places that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> held council during the prelude to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, implying that decisions were consensual and that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span> did not have the authority to issue direct orders to the other contingents.[34][38] This style of leadership contributed to the way events unfolded during the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> itself. For instance, in the period immediately before the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span> was unable to order the Athenians to join up with his forces, and thus the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fought the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> completely separated from each other.[51]
<br>
<br>According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> numbered 300,000 and were accompanied by troops from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> states that supported the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> cause (including <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia</b></span>).[52] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> admits that no one counted the latter, but he guesses that there were about 50,000 of them.[52] <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>' troops consisted of not only <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>, but also <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bactrians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bactria</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Scythians</b></span>, Indians, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Boeotians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Boeotia</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Locrians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Locris</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Malians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Demographics_of_Mali</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thessalians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thessaly</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Macedonians</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thracians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thrace</b></span>, and 1,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phocians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Ctesias</b></span>, who wrote a history of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> based on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> archives, claimed there were 120,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> and 7,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> soldiers, but his account is generally garbled (for instance, placing this <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> before <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>, he also says there were only <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>300 Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span>, 1000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>perioeci</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Perioeci</b></span> and 6000 from the other cities at <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>, perhaps confusing it with <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>).[53]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Diodorus Siculus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Diodorus_Siculus</b></span> claims in his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bibliotheca historica</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bibliotheca_historica</b></span> that the number of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> troops was some five hundred thousand.[40]
<br>
<br>The figure of 300,000 has been doubted, along with many of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' numbers, by many historians; modern consensus estimates the total number of troops for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion at around 250,000.[54] According to this consensus, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' 300,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> would self-evidently be impossible. One approach to estimating the size of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army has been to estimate how many men might feasibly have been accommodated within the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> camp; this approach gives figures of between 70,000 and 120,000 men.[47] Lazenby, for instance, by comparison with later Roman military camps, calculates the number of troops at 70,000, including 10,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>.[46] Meanwhile, Connolly derives a number of 120,000 from the same-sized camp.[55] Indeed, most estimates for the total <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> force are generally in this range.[56][57][58] For instance, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>DelbrÃ¼ck</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Max_DelbrÃ¼ck</b></span>, based on the distance the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> marched in a day when <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> was attacked, concluded that 75,000 was the upper limit for the size of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army, including the supply personnel and other non-combatants.[58] In his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> account of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>DelbrÃ¼ck</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Max_DelbrÃ¼ck</b></span> estimated the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army, including allied <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, as amounting to 40,000.[59]

<br>In some ways the run-up to <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> resembled that at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>; there was a prolonged stalemate in which neither side risked attacking the other.[32] The reasons for this stalemate were primarily tactical, and similar to the situation at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>; the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> did not want to risk being outflanked by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> and the lightly armed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> infantry could not hope to assault well-defended positions.[32][60]
<br>
<br>According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, both sides wished for a decisive <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> that would tip the war in their favor.[32][61] However, Lazenby believed that <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>' actions during the <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> campaign were not consistent with an aggressive policy.[60] He interprets the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> operations during the prelude not as attempts to force the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> into <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> but as attempts to force the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> into retreat (which indeed became the case).[62] <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> may have felt he had little to gain in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> and that he could simply wait for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> alliance to fall apart (as it had nearly done over the winter).[60] There can be little doubt from <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' account that <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> was prepared to accept <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> on his own terms, however. Regardless of the exact motives, the initial strategic situation allowed both sides to procrastinate, since food supplies were ample for both armies.[32][61] Under these conditions, the tactical considerations outweighed the strategic need for action.
<br>
<br>When <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>' raids disrupted the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>supply chain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Military_supply_chain_management</b></span>, it forced the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> to rethink their strategy. Rather than now moving to attack, however, they instead looked to retreat and secure their lines of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>communication</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Communication</b></span>.[38] Despite this defensive move by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, it was in fact the chaos resulting from this retreat that finally ended the stalemate. <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> perceived this as a full-on retreat, in effect thinking that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> was already over, and sought to pursue the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[63] Since he did not expect the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> to fight, the tactical problems were no longer an issue and he tried to take advantage of the altered strategic situation he thought he had produced.[32] Conversely, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> had, inadvertently, lured <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> into attacking them on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>higher ground</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sony_Music_Entertainment</b></span> and, despite being outnumbered, were thus at a tactical advantage.[32][64]
<br>
<br>Once the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> discovered that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> had abandoned their positions and appeared to be in retreat, <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> decided to set off in immediate pursuit with the elite <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> infantry.[65] As he did so, the rest of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army, unbidden, began to move forward.[65] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> and Tegeans had by now reached the Temple of <span style='color: blue'><b>Demeter</b></span>.[66] The rearguard under <span style='color: blue'><b>Amompharetus</b></span> began to withdraw from the ridge, under pressure from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>, to join them.[66] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span> sent a messenger to the Athenians, asking them to join up with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>.[51] However, the Athenians had been engaged by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Theban</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Theban_hegemony</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> and were unable to assist <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span>.[66] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> and Tegeans were first assaulted by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>,[51] while the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> infantry made their way forward. They then planted their shields and began shooting arrows at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, while the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> withdrew.[51][66]
<br>
<br>
<br>The main phase of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> retreat becomes disorganised, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> cross the <span style='color: blue'><b>Asopus</b></span> to attack.
<br>According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span> refused to advance because <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>good omens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Good_Omens</b></span> were not divined in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>goat</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Scapegoat</b></span> sacrifices that were performed.[67] At this point, as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> soldiers began to fall under the barrage of arrows, the Tegeans started to run at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> lines.[67] Offering one last sacrifice and a prayer to the heavens in front of the Temple of <span style='color: blue'><b>Hera</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span> finally received favourable omens and gave the command for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> to advance, whereupon they also charged the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> lines.[68]
<br>
<br>The numerically superior <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> infantry were of the heavy (by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> standards) <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sparabara</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sparabara</b></span> formation, but this was still much lighter than the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span>.[68] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>defensive weapon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Self-defense</b></span> was a large wicker shield and they used short spears; by contrast, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> were armored in bronze, with a bronze shield and a long spear.[66] As at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, it was a severe mismatch.[68][69] The fight was fierce and long, but the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> and Tegeans) continued to push into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> lines.[66] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> tried to break the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>' spears by grabbing hold of them, but the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> responded by switching to swords.[68] <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> was present at the scene, riding a white <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>horse</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>, and surrounded by a bodyguard of 1,000 men; while he remained, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> stood their ground.[68] However, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> closed in on <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> and a Spartan soldier named <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Arimnestus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aeimnestus</b></span> killed him.[70] According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Arimnestus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aeimnestus</b></span> killed him by a blow to the head with a stone, a form of death which had been foretold to <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> by an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oracle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delphi</b></span>;[71] some modern historians have called it unlikely that a Spartan would use such a weapon.[72] With <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> dead, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> began to flee; although his bodyguard remained, they were annihilated.[66] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> claims that the reason for their discomfort was a lack of armour. Quickly the rout became general, with many <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleeing in disorder to their camp.[69] However, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artabazus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artabazos_I_of_Phrygia</b></span> (who had earlier commanded the Sieges of <span style='color: blue'><b>Olynthus</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Potidea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Potidaea</b></span>), had disagreed with <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> about attacking the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>,[63] and he had not fully engaged the forces under his command.[73] As the rout commenced, he led these men (40,000, according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>) away from the battlefield, on the road to <span style='color: blue'><b>Thessaly</b></span>, hoping to escape eventually to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span>.[73]
<br>
<br>On the opposite side of the battlefield the Athenians had triumphed in a tough <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thebes,_Greece</b></span>.[74] The other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fighting for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> had deliberately fought badly, according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>.[74] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thebes,_Greece</b></span> retreated from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, but in a different direction from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, allowing them to escape without further losses.[75] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, reinforced by the contingents who had not taken part in the main <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, then stormed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> camp.[66][76] Although the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> initially defended the wall vigorously, it was eventually breached; the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, packed tightly together in the camp, were slaughtered by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[77] Of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> who had retreated to the camp, scarcely 3,000 were left alive.[77]
<br>
<br>According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, only 43,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> survived the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>.[77] The number who died, of course, depends on how many there were in the first place; there would be 257,000 dead by <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>reckoning</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Devil_(Dungeons_&_Dragons)</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> claims that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> as a whole lost only 159 men.[77] Furthermore, he claims that only <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, Tegeans and Athenians died, since they were the only ones who fought.[77] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>, who had access to other sources, gives 1,360 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> casualties,[78] while both <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephorus</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Diodorus Siculus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Diodorus_Siculus</b></span> tally the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> casualties to over 10,000.[79]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> recounts several anecdotes about the conduct of specific <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> during the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Amompharetus</b></span>: The leader of a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battalion</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battalion</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, he refused to undertake the night-time retreat towards <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> before the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, since doing so would be shameful for a Spartan.[80] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> has an angry debate continuing between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Amompharetus</b></span> until dawn, whereupon the rest of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartan army</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> finally began to retreat, leaving <span style='color: blue'><b>Amompharetus</b></span>' division behind.[81] Not expecting this, <span style='color: blue'><b>Amompharetus</b></span> eventually led his men after the retreating <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>.[82] However, another tradition remembers <span style='color: blue'><b>Amompharetus</b></span> as winning great renown at <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>, and it has thus been suggested that <span style='color: blue'><b>Amompharetus</b></span>, far from being insubordinate, had instead volunteered to guard the rear.[66]
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Aristodemus</b></span>: The lone Spartan survivor of the slaughter of the 300 at the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> had, with a fellow <span style='color: blue'><b>Spartiate</b></span>, been dismissed from the army by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> because of an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>eye</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Eye</b></span> infection. However, his colleague had insisted on being led into <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, partially blind, by a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helot</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span>.[83] Preferring to return to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristodemus</b></span> was branded a coward and suffered a year of reproach before <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>.[66] Anxious to redeem his name, he charged the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> lines by himself, killing in a savage fury before being cut down.[84] Although the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> agreed that he had redeemed himself, they awarded him no special honour, because he failed to fight in the disciplined manner expected of a Spartan.[66]
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Callicrates</b></span>: Considered the "most beautiful man, not among the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> only, but in the whole <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek camp</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_Jupiter_trojans_(Greek_camp)</b></span>", <span style='color: blue'><b>Callicrates</b></span> was eager to distinguish himself that day as a warrior but was deprived of the chance by a stray arrow that pierced his side while standing in formation. When the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> commenced he insisted on making the charge with the rest, but collapsed within a short distance. His last words, according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, were, "I grieve not because I have to die for my country, but because I have not lifted my arm against the enemy."[85]
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> also recounts that King <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> I of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedonia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Republic_of_Macedonia</b></span> (an ancestor of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> I the Great,) who was allied to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> and present in their camp, secretly rode to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek camp</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_Jupiter_trojans_(Greek_camp)</b></span> with a warning that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> had decided to attack,[86] and that before the main <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> issued a challenge to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> to fight a special <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> between equal numbers of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, which was declined.[87] Some historians have called these stories improbable.[88]<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>[89</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Effects_of_Hurricane_Sandy_in_New_York</b></span>]
<br>
<br>According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span> occurred on the same afternoon as <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>. A <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet under the Spartan king <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leotychides</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leotychidas</b></span> had sailed to <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span> to challenge the remnants of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet.[90] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span>, whose ships were in a poor state of repair, had decided not to risk fighting and instead drew their ships up on the beach at the feet of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mount Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mycale</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>. An army of 60,000 men had been left there by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> and the fleet joined with them, building a palisade around the camp to protect the ships.[90] However, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leotychides</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leotychidas</b></span> decided to attack the camp with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> fleet's marines.[91] Seeing the small size of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> force, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> emerged from the camp but the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> again proved superior and destroyed much of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> force.[91] The ships were abandoned to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, who burned them, crippling <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>' <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sea power</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naval_warfare</b></span> and marking the ascendancy of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet.[91]
<br>
<br>With the twin victories of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>, the second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> was over. Moreover, the threat of future invasion was abated; although the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> remained worried that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> would try again, over time it became apparent that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> desire to conquer <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> was much diminished.[92]
<br>
<br>The remnants of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army, under the command of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artabazus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artabazos_I_of_Phrygia</b></span>, tried to retreat back to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>. Travelling through the lands of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thessaly</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedonia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Republic_of_Macedonia</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span> by the shortest road, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artabazus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artabazos_I_of_Phrygia</b></span> eventually made it back to <span style='color: blue'><b>Byzantium</b></span>, though losing many men to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thracian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thrace</b></span> attacks, weariness and hunger.[93] After the victory at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> fleet sailed to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> to break down the pontoon bridges, but found that this had already been done.[94] The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians remained to attack the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chersonesos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gallipoli</b></span>, still held by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[94] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> in the region, and their allies, made for Sestos, the strongest town in the region, and the Athenians laid <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span> to them there. After a protracted <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span> Sestos fell to the Athenians, marking the beginning of a new phase in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek counterattack</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>.[95] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> ended his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span> after the Siege of Sestos. Over the next 30 years the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, primarily the Athenian-dominated <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>, would expel (or help expel) the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean islands</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>.[95] Peace with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> came in 449 BC with the Peace of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Callias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Callias_II</b></span>, finally ending a half-century of warfare.[95]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span> have great significance in ancient history as the battles that decisively ended the second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, thereby swinging the balance of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> in favour of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. They kept <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> from conquering all of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, although they paid a high price by losing many of their men.[95] The Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> showed that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> could be defeated, and the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> saved <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> from immediate conquest, but it was <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span> that effectively ended that threat.[95] However, neither of these battles is nearly as well known as <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>.[96] The reason for this discrepancy is not entirely clear; it might, however, be a result of the circumstances in which the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> was fought. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The fame</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Fame</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> certainly lies in the doomed heroism of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> in the face of overwhelming numbers;[97] and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> perhaps because they were both fought against the odds, and in dire strategic situations. Conversely, the Battles of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span> were both fought from a relative position of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> strength, and against lesser odds; the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, in fact, sought out <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> on both occasions.[26][95]
<br>
<br>Militarily, the major lesson of both <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span> (since both were fought on land) was to re-emphasise the superiority of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> over the more lightly armed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> infantry, as had first been demonstrated at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>.[92] Taking on this lesson, after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> empire started recruiting and relying on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mercenaries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mercenary</b></span>.[98] One such <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mercenary</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mercenary</b></span> expedition, the "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Anabasis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Anabasis_of_Alexander</b></span> of the 10,000" as narrated by <span style='color: blue'><b>Xenophon</b></span>, further proved to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were militarily vulnerable even well within their own territory, and paved the way for the destruction of the Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> I the Great some decades later.

<br>A bronze column in the shape of intertwined snakes (the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Serpent column</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Serpent_Column</b></span>) was created from melted-down <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> weapons, acquired in the plunder of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> camp, and was erected at <span style='color: blue'><b>Delphi</b></span>.[99] It commemorated all the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states that had participated in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, listing them on the column, and thus confirming some of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' claims.[100] Most of it still survives in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hippodrome</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hippodrome_of_Constantinople</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Constantinople</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Byzantine_Empire</b></span> (present-day <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Istanbul</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Constantinople</b></span>), where it was carried by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Constantine</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Constantine_the_Great</b></span> during the founding of his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> on the Greek <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>colony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Colonies_in_antiquity</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Byzantium</b></span>.[101]

<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>main source</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Main_Source</b></span> for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> is the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, who has been called the 'Father of History',[102] was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> (then under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> overlordship). He wrote his 'Enquiries' (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> â€“ Historia; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>English</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kingdom_of_England</b></span> â€“ (The) <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span>) around 440â€“430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ending in 450 BC).[97] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented 'history' as we know it.[97] As <span style='color: blue'><b>Holland</b></span> has it: "For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>manifest destiny</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Manifest_destiny</b></span>, but rather explanations he could verify personally".[97]
<br>
<br>Some subsequent ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, starting with <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>.[103][104] Nevertheless, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> chose to begin his history where <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> left off (at the Siege of Sestos), and therefore evidently felt that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting.[104] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> criticised <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> in his essay "On The Malignity of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>", describing <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> as "Philobarbaros" (barbarian-lover), for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed.[105] A negative view of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> was passed on to <span style='color: blue'><b>Renaissance</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>, though he remained well read.[106] However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaeological finds which have repeatedly confirmed his version of events.[107] The prevailing modern view is that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> generally did a remarkable job in his Historia, but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>skepticism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Skepticism</b></span>.[107] Nevertheless, there are still some historians who believe <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> made up much of his story.[108]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Sicilian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Sicilian</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Diodorus Siculus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Diodorus_Siculus</b></span>, writing in the 1st century BC in his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bibliotheca Historica</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bibliotheca_historica</b></span>, also provides an account of the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>. This account is fairly consistent with <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s, but given that it was written much later, it may well have been derived from <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s version.[109] The Battle is also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Ctesias</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cnidus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Knidos</b></span>, and is alluded by other authors, such as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>playwright</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Theatre</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeschylus</b></span>. Archaeological evidence, such as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Serpent Column</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Serpent_Column</b></span> also supports some of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>
