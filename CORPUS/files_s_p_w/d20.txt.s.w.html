The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of Athens, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, with its famous <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Acropolis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Acropolis_of_Athens</b></span>, has come to symbolize the whole of the country in the popular imagination, and not without cause. Athens began as a small, Mycenaen community and grew to become a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> that, at its height, epitomized the best of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> virtues and enjoyed such prestige that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> refused to sack the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> or enslave the citizens, even after Athens' defeat in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span>. This set a model that would be followed by future conquerors who would defeat Athens but not destroy it.
<br>
<br>Evidence of human habitation on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Acropolis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Acropolis_of_Athens</b></span> and, below, in the area around the <span style='color: blue'><b>Agora</b></span>, dates back clearly as far as 5000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> and, probably, as early as 7000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. According to legend, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> King <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cecrops</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cecrops_I</b></span> named the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> after himself but the gods, seeing how beautiful it was, felt it deserved an immortal name. A contest was held among the gods on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Acropolis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Acropolis_of_Athens</b></span>, with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cecrops</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cecrops_I</b></span> and the citizenry looking on, to determine which deity would win the honor. <span style='color: blue'><b>Poseidon</b></span> struck a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>rock</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Rock_music</b></span> with his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>trident</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Trident</b></span> and, as water gushed forth, he assured the people that now they would never suffer <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>drought</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Drought</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Athena</b></span> was next in line and dropped a seed into the earth which sprouted swiftly as an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>olive tree</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Olive</b></span>. The people thought the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>olive tree</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Olive</b></span> more valuable than the water (as, according to some versions of the story, the water was salty, as was <span style='color: blue'><b>Poseidon</b></span>'s realm) and <span style='color: blue'><b>Athena</b></span> was chosen as patron and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> named for her. 
<br>
<br>As the soil was not conducive to large-scale agricultural programs, Athens turned to trade for its livelihood and, mainly, to sea trade. The early <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycenaean period</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mycenaean_Greece</b></span> (c. 1550 - 1100 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>) saw massive fortresses rise all over <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, and Athens was no exception. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The remains</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Remains</b></span> of a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycenaean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mycenaean_Greece</b></span> palace can still be seen today on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Acropolis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Acropolis_of_Athens</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Homer</b></span>'s <span style='color: blue'><b>Iliad</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Odyssey</b></span> portray the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycenaeans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mycenaean_Greece</b></span> as great warriors and seafaring people, and there is no doubt they traded widely throughout the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mediterranean region</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mediterranean_Sea</b></span>. In c. 1200 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sea Peoples</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sea_Peoples</b></span> invaded the Greek <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>archipelago</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archipelago</b></span> of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> from the south while, simultaneously, the <span style='color: blue'><b>Dorians</b></span> came down from the north into mainland <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. While the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sea Peoples</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sea_Peoples</b></span> made definite incursions into <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span> (the mainland region surrounding Athens) the <span style='color: blue'><b>Dorians</b></span> by-passed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>, allowing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycenaean culture</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mycenaean_Greece</b></span> to survive (although, like the rest of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, there seems to have been an economic and cultural downturn following these invasions). The Athenians, afterward, claimed for themselves a special status in that they spoke <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span>, instead of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Doric</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dorians</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and held to customs they felt were superior to their neighbors.
<br>
<br>The wealthy aristocrats held control of both the land and the government and, in time, poorer land owners became enslaved (or nearly so) through debt to the more wealthy. Further, there was a perceived lack of consistency among the other laws of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>. The first series of laws written to address these problems were provided by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>statesman</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Scholar-official</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Draco</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Draco_Malfoy</b></span> (also known as Dracon/Drakon) in c. 621 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> but were considered too severe (the penalty for most infractions was death), and so the great lawgiver <span style='color: blue'><b>Solon</b></span> was called upon to modify and revise them. <span style='color: blue'><b>Solon</b></span>, though an aristocrat himself, created a series of laws which equalized the political power of the citizenry and, in so doing, laid the groundwork for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span> in Athens in 594 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. After <span style='color: blue'><b>Solon</b></span> resigned from public office various factional leaders sought to seize power and the ultimate victor, <span style='color: blue'><b>Peisistratos</b></span>, recognized the value of <span style='color: blue'><b>Solon</b></span>'s revisions and kept them, in a modified form, throughout his reign as a benevolent <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span>. His son, <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span>, continued his policies until his younger brother, Hipparkhos, was assassinated over a love affair in 514 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. After this <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span> instituted a reign of terror which finally culminated in the overthrow of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peisistratid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peisistratos</b></span> tyranny in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> Revolt of 510 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> (backed by <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> and lead by the Spartan Kleomenes). In the aftermath of the coup, and after settling affairs with Spartan factions such as <span style='color: blue'><b>Isagoras</b></span>'s bid for power, <span style='color: blue'><b>Cleisthenes</b></span> was appointed to reform the government and the laws and, in 507 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, he instituted a new form of government which today is recognized as Democracy. According to the historian Waterfield, "The pride that followed from widespread involvement in public life gave Athenians the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>energy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Energy</b></span> to develop their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> both internally and in relation to their neighbors". This new form of government would provide the stability necessary to make Athens the cultural and intellectual center of the ancient world; a reputation which lasts even into the modern age.
<br>
<br>After the Athenians (with the help of Plataeans) defeated the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> in 490 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> and, again, after driving off a second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> in 480 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> (and soundly defeating the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Plataea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Plataea</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span> in 479 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>), Athens emerged as the supreme naval power in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. They formed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>, ostensibly to create a cohesive <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> network among city-states to ward off further <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> attacks, and, under the leadership of <span style='color: blue'><b>Pericles</b></span>, grew so powerful that the Athenian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> could effectively dictate the laws, customs, and trade of all her neighbors in <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span> and the islands of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The historian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Historian</b></span> Waterfield writes: 
<br>
<br>There is no little <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>irony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Irony</b></span> in the fact that one of the things we most admire in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ancient Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> is their love of freedom - and yet one of the chief manifestations of that love was their constant striving to control in some way the futures of their neighbors.
<br>
<br>Even so, under <span style='color: blue'><b>Pericles</b></span>, Athens entered her golden age and great thinkers, writers, and artists flourished in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, the `father of history', lived and wrote in Athens. <span style='color: blue'><b>Socrates</b></span>, the `father of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>philosophy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_philosophy</b></span>', taught in the marketplace. <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippocrates</b></span>, `the father of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>medicine</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medicine</b></span>', practiced there. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sculptor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_sculpture</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Phidias</b></span> created his great works for the <span style='color: blue'><b>Parthenon</b></span> on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Acropolis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Acropolis_of_Athens</b></span> and the Temple of <span style='color: blue'><b>Zeus</b></span> at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Opel_Olympia</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Democritus</b></span> envisioned an atomic universe. <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeschylus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Euripedes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Euripides</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristophanes</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sophocles</b></span> wrote their famous plays and <span style='color: blue'><b>Pindar</b></span> his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Odes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Canticle</b></span>. This legacy would continue as, later, <span style='color: blue'><b>Plato</b></span> would found his Academy outside the walls of Athens in 385 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> and, later, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristotle</b></span>'s <span style='color: blue'><b>Lyceum</b></span> would be founded in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> centre.
<br>
<br>The might of the Athenian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> encouraged an arrogance in the policy makers of the day which grew intolerable to her neighbors. When Athens sent troops to help <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> put down a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Helot</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span> rebellion, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> refused the gesture and sent the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> force back home in dishonor, thus provoking the war which had long been <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>brewing</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Brewing</b></span>. Later, when Athens sent their fleet to help defend its ally Cocyra (<span style='color: blue'><b>Corfu</b></span>) against a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corinth</b></span> invasion during the Battle of Sybota in 433 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, their action was interpreted by <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> as aggression instead of assistance, as <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> was an ally of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>.
<br>
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> (431-404 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>) between Athens and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> (though involving, directly or indirectly, all of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>) ended in disaster for Athens after her defeat. Her empire and her wealth gone, her walls destroyed, only her reputation as a great seat of learning and culture prevented the sack of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> and the enslavement of the populace. Athens struggled to throw off her condition as a subject state, and with some success, until they were defeated in 338 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Macedonians</b></span> forces under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Philip II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Philip_II_of_Macedon</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Chaeronea</b></span>. Athens was then subject to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Macedonians</b></span> rule until their defeat by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Romans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Republic</b></span> in 197 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> at the Battle of Cynocephalae after which <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> was methodically conquered by the Roman <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span>. It is a tribute to an enduring legacy that the Roman general <span style='color: blue'><b>Sulla</b></span>, who sacked Athens in 87-86 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, slaughtered the citizenry, and burned the port of <span style='color: blue'><b>Piraeus</b></span>, refused to allow his soldiers to burn the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> itself. In the modern age the name of Athens still conjures to the mind words and images of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>classical</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_antiquity</b></span> world and the heights of intellectual and poetic creativity, while the <span style='color: blue'><b>Parthenon</b></span> on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Acropolis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Acropolis_of_Athens</b></span> continues to symbolize the golden age of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ancient Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>
