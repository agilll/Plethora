<span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> was one of the most important <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states throughout the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Archaic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archaic_Greece</b></span> and Classical periods and was famous for its military prowess. The professional and well-trained Spartan <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> with their distinctive red cloaks, long hair, and lambda-emblazoned shields were probably the best and most feared fighters in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, fighting with distinction at such key battles as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> in the early 5th century <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> was also in constant rivalry with the other major <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> and became involved in two protracted and hugely damaging conflicts, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> of the mid- to late 5th century <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corinth</b></span> Wars of in the early 4th century <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>.   
<br>
<br>In <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek mythology</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_mythology</b></span> the founder of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> was <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lacedaemon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sparta</b></span>, a son of <span style='color: blue'><b>Zeus</b></span>, who gave his name to the region and his wife’s name to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> was also an important member of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> force which participated in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Trojan War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Trojan_War</b></span>. Indeed, the Spartan king <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Menelaos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Menelaus</b></span> instigated the war after the Trojan prince <span style='color: blue'><b>Paris</b></span> abducted his wife Helen, offered to <span style='color: blue'><b>Paris</b></span> by the goddess <span style='color: blue'><b>Aphrodite</b></span> as a prize for choosing her in a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>beauty contest</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Beauty_pageant</b></span> with fellow goddesses <span style='color: blue'><b>Athena</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Hera</b></span>. Helen was said to have been the most beautiful woman in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and Spartan women in general enjoyed a reputation not only for good looks but also spirited independence.   
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> was located in the fertile <span style='color: blue'><b>Eurotas</b></span> valley of <span style='color: blue'><b>Laconia</b></span> in the southeast <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>. The area was first settled in the <span style='color: blue'><b>Neolithic</b></span> period and an important settlement developed in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bronze Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bronze_Age</b></span>. Archaeological evidence, however, suggests that <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> itself was a new settlement created from the 10th century <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>.
<br>
<br>In the late 8th century <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> subjugated most of neighbouring <span style='color: blue'><b>Messenia</b></span> and its population was made to serve Spartan interests. <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> thus came to control some 8,500 km² of territory making the polis or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city-state</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Polis</b></span> the largest in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and a major player in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> politics. The conquered peoples of <span style='color: blue'><b>Messenia</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Laconia</b></span>, known as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>perioikoi</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Perioeci</b></span>, had no political rights in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> and were often made to serve with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartan army</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>. A second and lower social group was the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helots</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span>, semi-enslaved agricultural labourers who lived on Spartan-owned estates. Intermediary between the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helots</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>perioikoi</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Perioeci</b></span> were the liberated <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helots</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span> or neodamōdeis. Spartan citizens did not indulge in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>farming</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Agriculture</b></span> activities themselves but devoted their time to military training, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hunting</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hunter-gatherer</b></span>, war, and politics. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helots</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span> could keep a percentage of the produce they cultivated, but they were also regularly purged to keep them firmly in their social place and they could also be conscripted into military duties in times of war.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The relationship</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Relationship</b></span> between citizens and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helots</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span> was an uneasy one and there were sometimes uprisings, notably in the 7th century <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> which contributed to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>’s defeat to <span style='color: blue'><b>Argos</b></span> at Hysiae in 669 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> gained revenge on <span style='color: blue'><b>Argos</b></span> in c. 545 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> but then lost a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> with <span style='color: blue'><b>Tegea</b></span> shortly after. This regional instability brought about the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_League</b></span> (c. 505 to 365 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>) which was a grouping of <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Elis</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Tegea</b></span>, and other states (but never <span style='color: blue'><b>Argos</b></span>), where each member swore to have the same enemies and allies as <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>. Membership of the League did not necessitate the paying of tribute to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> but rather the provision of troops. The League would allow <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> to establish <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hegemony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_hegemony</b></span> over and dominate the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span> until the 4th century <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. In addition to local politics, from the 6th century <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> began to broaden her horizons by, for example, creating an alliance with <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span> and sending an expedition against <span style='color: blue'><b>Polycrates</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span> in c. 525 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span> (c. 520-490 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>), overthrew the tyrants of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> but the resulting <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span> put a stop to any Spartan ambitions in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> was, however, an ally with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> in the defence of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> against the invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>king Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>, and fought with distinction at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span> in 480 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> and at <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> one year later. From 480 to 460 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> regional rivalries and revolts by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helots</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span> damaged <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> and worse were to follow when rivalry with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> developed into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> from c. 460 to 446 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> and again from 431 to 404 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. The long wars were damaging to both sides but <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, with some <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> help, finally won the conflict when <span style='color: blue'><b>Lysander</b></span> destroyed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> fleet at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegospotami</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Aegospotami</b></span> in 405 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>’s position as the number one <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city-state</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Polis</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, though, was to be short-lived.
<br>
<br>Continued Spartan ambitions in central and northern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicily</b></span> once again dragged the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> into another protracted conflict, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corinth</b></span> Wars with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> from 396 to 387 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. The result of the conflict was the ‘King’s Peace’ where <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> ceded her empire (for which she in any case lacked the necessary bureaucratic apparatus to manage properly) to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> control but <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> was left to dominate <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. However, trying to crush <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> lost the crucial <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leuctra</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Leuctra</b></span> in 371 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> against the brilliant <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Theban</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Theban_hegemony</b></span> general <span style='color: blue'><b>Epaminondas</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia</b></span> then annexed parts of <span style='color: blue'><b>Messenia</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> became thereafter only a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>second-rate</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Second-rate</b></span> power.
<br>
<br>After briefly challenging <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Macedonians</b></span> control in the 3rd century <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> and being besieged by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pyrrhus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pyrrhus_of_Epirus</b></span> in 272 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> never regained her former glory and she was compelled to join the Achaean <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Confederacy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Confederation</b></span> in 195 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. Under Roman control <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> was permitted to leave the confederacy in 147 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> which prompted the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaean War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaean_War</b></span>. However, as a free <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> in the Roman world things did improve for <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> enjoyed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>good relations</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Good_Relations</b></span> with her conquerors but the end finally came for <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> in 396 CE when the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Visigoth</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Visigoths</b></span> king <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alaric</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alaric_I</b></span> sacked the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The Spartan political system was unusual in that it had two hereditary kings from two separate families. These monarchs were particularly powerful when one of them led the army on campaign. The kings were also priests of <span style='color: blue'><b>Zeus</b></span> and they sat on the council of elders known as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>gerousia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gerousia</b></span>. This body consisted of 28 over-60 years of age males who held the position for life. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>gerousia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gerousia</b></span> led the citizen assembly, probably proposing issues on which to vote and it was also the highest court in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>. The assembly (Ekklēsia) met once a month and was open to all citizens who voted by the simple method of shouting. There was also an executive committee of five <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ephors</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephor</b></span> (ephoroi) chosen by lot from the citizen body, able only to serve for a maximum of one year and who were ineligible for future office. Two of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ephors</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephor</b></span> also accompanied one of the kings when on campaign. Just how these different political elements interacted is not known for certain but clearly a degree of consensus was necessary for the state apparatus to function. It may also explain <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>’s reputation as being a conservative state slow to make decisions in foreign policy.  
<br>
<br>Like all <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> societies <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> was dominated by male citizens and the most powerful of those came from a select group of families. These were the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>landed aristocracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Landed_nobility</b></span>, and following reforms credited to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lycurgus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lycurgus_of_Sparta</b></span> in the 6th century <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> (or even earlier), citizens could not indulge in agricultural activities - this was the lot of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helots</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span> - but they had to devote themselves to athletic and military training and politics. <span style='color: blue'><b>Helots</b></span> could not own property and so could not rise to become full-citizens, and this lack of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>social mobility</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Social_mobility</b></span> would come back to haunt <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> in later centuries.  Reduced by constant wars in the 5th and 4th centuries <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, the Spartan <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> (homoioi) became dangerously small in number (8,000 in 490 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> to 700 in 371 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>), so much so, that non-Spartiate soldiers had to be enlisted and their loyalty and interest in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>’s ambitions was questionable.
<br>
<br>Women in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> had a better lot than in other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states. In <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> they could own property which they often gained through <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dowries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dowry</b></span> and inheritances. In fact, women became amongst the richest members of society, as their men were killed in the many wars, and eventually controlled 2/5th of Spartan land. In addition, Spartan women could also move around with reasonable freedom, they could enjoy athletics (done in the nude like men), and even drink <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>wine</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Wine</b></span>. All of these freedoms would have been unacceptable in other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>poleis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Polis</b></span>.  
<br>
<br>There were foreigners (xenoi) in Spartan society but these were not as welcome as in other city-states, and those that did live in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> were sometimes forcibly expelled by their overly suspicious and at times positively paranoid hosts.
<br>
<br>For all Spartan citizens there was a strong emphasis on military training and frugal living in communal mess halls where simple food such as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>barley</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Barley</b></span> meal, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cheese</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cheese</b></span>, figs and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>wine</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Wine</b></span> were the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>norm</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Norm_(social)</b></span>. From the age of seven, males had a militaristic upbringing known as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>agōgē</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Agoge</b></span> where they were separated into age groups and lived in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>barracks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Barracks</b></span>. These youths pursued rigorous athletic and military training which became even more demanding from the age of 20, when they joined common mess halls (syssition) where they often formed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>homoerotic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Homosexuality</b></span> relations with older, more experienced citizens. This tough training resulted in a professional <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> army capable of relatively sophisticated <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> manoeuvres and made them feared throughout <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, a fact perhaps evidenced by <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>’s notable lack of fortifications for most of its history.
<br>
<br>
<br>A peculiar feature of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> and their military was the great importance given to matters of religion. As <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> put it, they ‘considered the things of the gods more weighty than the things of men’. Pre- and post-battle sacrifices were a common feature of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> warfare in general but the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartan army</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> took things one step further and sacrificed before crossing rivers, for example, and even withheld from mobilising the army if an important religious festival was ongoing. Famous episodes where the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> put religion above warfare and even national crisis were <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span> during the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>.
