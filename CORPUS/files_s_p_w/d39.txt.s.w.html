The Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>: Μάχη τοῦ Μαραθῶνος, Machē tou Marathōnos) took place in 490 BC, during the first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. It was fought between the citizens of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, aided by <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>, and a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> force commanded by Datis and <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> was the culmination of the first attempt by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, under King <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>, to subjugate <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army decisively defeated the more numerous <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, marking a turning point in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion was a response to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> involvement in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>, when <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> had sent a force to support the cities of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> in their attempt to overthrow <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule. The Athenians and Eretrians had succeeded in capturing and burning <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>, but they were then forced to retreat with heavy losses. In response to this raid, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> swore to burn down <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>. According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> had his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>bow</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bow_and_arrow</b></span> brought to him and then shot an arrow "upwards towards heaven", saying as he did so: "<span style='color: blue'><b>Zeus</b></span>, that it may be granted me to take vengeance upon the Athenians!". <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> further writes that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> charged one of his servants to say "Master, remember the Athenians" three times before dinner each day.[4]
<br>
<br>At the time of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> were the two largest city-states in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. Once the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> was finally crushed by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> victory at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> in 494 BC, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> began plans to subjugate <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. In 490 BC, he sent a naval task force under Datis and <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> across the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span>, to subjugate the <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyclades</b></span>, and then to make punitive attacks on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>. Reaching <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span> in mid-summer after a successful campaign in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> proceeded to besiege and capture <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> force then sailed for <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>, landing in the bay near the town of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>. The Athenians, joined by a small force from <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>, marched to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, and succeeded in blocking the two exits from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Great_Plains</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>. The Athenians also sent a message asking for support to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>. When the messenger arrived in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> were involved in a religious festival and gave this as a reason for not coming to aid of the Athenians.
<br>
<br>The Athenians and their allies chose a location for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, with marshes and mountainous terrain, that prevented the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> from joining the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> infantry. <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> general, ordered a general attack against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> forces, composed primarily of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>missile</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Missile</b></span> troops. He reinforced his flanks, luring the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>' best fighters into his center. The inward wheeling flanks enveloped the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, routing them. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army broke in panic towards their ships, and large numbers were slaughtered. The defeat at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> marked the end of the first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> force retreated to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> then began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>; however, in 486 BC, his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> expedition. After <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> died, his son <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> restarted the preparations for a second invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, which finally began in 480 BC.
<br>
<br>The Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> was a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>watershed</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Drainage_basin</b></span> in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, showing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> could be beaten; the eventual <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> triumph in these wars can be seen to begin at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> also showed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> that they were able to win battles without the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, as they had heavily relied on <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> previously. This victory was largely due to the Athenians, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> raised <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> esteem of them. Since the following two hundred years saw the rise of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Classical Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> civilization, which has been enduringly influential in western society, the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> is often seen as a pivotal moment in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mediterranean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mediterranean_Sea</b></span> and European history.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>main source</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Main_Source</b></span> for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> is the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, who has been called the "Father of History",[5] was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> (then under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> overlordship). He wrote his Enquiries (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> – Historia; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>English</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kingdom_of_England</b></span> – (The) <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span>) around 440–430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ended in 450 BC).[6] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented "history" as we know it.[6] As <span style='color: blue'><b>Holland</b></span> has it: "For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>manifest destiny</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Manifest_destiny</b></span>, but rather explanations he could verify personally."[6]
<br>
<br>Some subsequent ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, starting with <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>.[7][8] Nevertheless, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> chose to begin his history where <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> left off (at the Siege of Sestos), and may therefore have felt that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting.[8] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> criticised <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> in his essay On the malice of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, describing <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> as "Philobarbaros" (barbarian-lover), for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed.[9] A negative view of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> was passed on to <span style='color: blue'><b>Renaissance</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>, though he remained well read.[10] However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaeological finds which have repeatedly confirmed his version of events.[11] The prevailing modern view is that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> generally did a remarkable job in his Historia, but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>skepticism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Skepticism</b></span>.[11] Nevertheless, there are still some historians who believe <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> made up much of his story.[12]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Sicilian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Sicilian</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Diodorus Siculus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Diodorus_Siculus</b></span>, writing in the 1st century BC in his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bibliotheca Historica</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bibliotheca_historica</b></span>, also provides an account of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, partially derived from the earlier <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephorus</b></span>. This account is fairly consistent with <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s.[13] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Ctesias</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cnidus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Knidos</b></span>, and are alluded by other authors, such as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>playwright</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Theatre</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeschylus</b></span>. Archaeological evidence, such as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Serpent Column</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Serpent_Column</b></span>, also supports some of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s specific claims.[14]
<br>
<br>The first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> had its immediate roots in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>, the earliest phase of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>. However, it was also the result of the longer-term interaction between the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. In 500 BC the Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> was still relatively young and highly expansionistic, but prone to revolts amongst its subject peoples.[15][16][17] Moreover, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> King <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> was a usurper, and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule.[15] Even before the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> had begun to expand the empire into <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>, subjugating <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span>, and forcing <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span> to become a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vassal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vassal</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[18] Attempts at further expansion into the politically fractious world of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ancient Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> may have been inevitable.[16] However, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> had directly threatened the integrity of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> empire, and the states of mainland <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> remained a potential menace to its future stability.[19] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> thus resolved to subjugate and pacify <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span>, and to punish those involved in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>.[19][20]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> had begun with an unsuccessful expedition against <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>, a joint venture between the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>.[21] In the aftermath, <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> decided to remove <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> from power, but before he could do so, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> abdicated, and declared <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span>.[21] The other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> cities followed suit, ejecting their Persian-appointed tyrants, and declaring themselves democracies.[21][22] <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> then appealed to the states of mainland <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> for support, but only <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> offered to send troops.[23]
<br>
<br>The involvement of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> arose from a complex set of circumstances, beginning with the establishment of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian Democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span> in the late 6th century BC.[23]

<br>In 510 BC, with the aid of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span>, King of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> people had expelled <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> ruler of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>.[24] With <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span>'s father <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peisistratus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peisistratos</b></span>, the family had ruled for 36 out of the previous 50 years and fully intended to continue <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span>'s rule.[24] <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span> fled to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> to the court of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> and promised control of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> if they were to help restore him.[25] In the meantime, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span> helped install a pro-Spartan tyranny under <span style='color: blue'><b>Isagoras</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, in opposition to <span style='color: blue'><b>Cleisthenes</b></span>, the leader of the traditionally powerful <span style='color: blue'><b>Alcmaeonidae</b></span> family, who considered themselves the natural heirs to the rule of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>.[26] <span style='color: blue'><b>Cleisthenes</b></span>, however, found himself being politically defeated by a coalition led by <span style='color: blue'><b>Isagoras</b></span> and decided to change the rules of the game by appealing to the demos (the people), in effect making them a new faction in the political arena. This tactic succeeded, but the Spartan King, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span>, returned at the request of <span style='color: blue'><b>Isagoras</b></span> and so <span style='color: blue'><b>Cleisthenes</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alcmaeonids</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alcmaeonidae</b></span> and other prominent <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> families were exiled from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>. When <span style='color: blue'><b>Isagoras</b></span> attempted to create a narrow <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oligarchic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Oligarchy</b></span> government, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> people, in a spontaneous and unprecedented move, expelled <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Isagoras</b></span>.[27] <span style='color: blue'><b>Cleisthenes</b></span> was thus restored to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> (507 BC), and at breakneck speed began to reform the state with the aim of securing his position. The result was not actually a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span> or a real civic state, but he enabled the development of a fully democratic government, which would emerge in the next generation as the demos realized its power.[28] The new-found freedom and self-governance of the Athenians meant that they were thereafter exceptionally hostile to the return of the tyranny of <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span>, or any form of outside subjugation, by <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, or anyone else.[27]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span> was not pleased with events, and marched on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartan army</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>.[29] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span>'s attempts to restore <span style='color: blue'><b>Isagoras</b></span> to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> ended in a debacle, but fearing the worst, the Athenians had by this point already sent an embassy to <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>, to request aid from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> empire.[30] <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> requested that the Athenians give him an 'earth and water', a traditional token of submission, to which the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> ambassadors acquiesced.[30] They were, however, severely censured for this when they returned to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>.[30] At some later point <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span> instigated a plot to restore <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span> to the rule of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>. This failed and <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span> again fled to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> and tried to persuade the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> to subjugate <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>.[31] The Athenians dispatched ambassadors to <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> to dissuade him from taking action, but <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> merely instructed the Athenians to take <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span> back as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span>.[23] The Athenians indignantly declined, and instead resolved to open war with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[31] Having thus become the enemy of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> was already in a position to support the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> cities when they began their revolt.[23] The fact that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> democracies were inspired by the example the Athenians had set no doubt further persuaded the Athenians to support the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>, especially since the cities of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> were originally <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> colonies.[23]
<br>
<br>The Athenians and Eretrians sent a task force of 25 triremes to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> to aid the revolt.[32] Whilst there, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army surprised and outmaneuvered <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>, marching to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> and burning the lower <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>.[33] This was, however, as much as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> achieved, and they were then repelled and pursued back to the coast by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> horsemen, losing many men in the process. Despite the fact that their actions were ultimately fruitless, the Eretrians and in particular the Athenians had earned <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>'s lasting enmity, and he vowed to punish both cities.[34] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> naval victory at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> (494 BC) all but ended the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>, and by 493 BC, the last hold-outs were vanquished by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet.[35] The revolt was used as an opportunity by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> to extend the empire's border to the islands of the eastern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span>[36] and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Propontis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sea_of_Marmara</b></span>, which had not been part of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> dominions before.[37] The pacification of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> allowed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> to begin planning their next moves; to extinguish the threat to the empire from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and to punish <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>.[38]
<br>
<br>In 492 BC, after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> had finally been crushed, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> dispatched an expedition to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> under the command of his son-in-law, <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> re-subjugated <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span> and made <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedonia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Republic_of_Macedonia</b></span> a fully subordinate part of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>; they had been vassals of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> since the late 6th century BC, but retained their general autonomy.[39] Not long after however, his fleet became wrecked by a violent storm, which brought a premature end to the campaign.[40] However, in 490 BC, following the successes of the previous campaign, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> decided to send a maritime expedition led by <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>, (son of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> to whom <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span> had fled) and Datis, a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>admiral</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Admiral</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> had been injured in the prior campaign and had fallen out of favor. The expedition was intended to bring the <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyclades</b></span> into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> empire, to punish <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span> (which had resisted a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> assault in 499 BC) and then to head to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> to force <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> to submit to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> or be destroyed.[41] After <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>island-hopping</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leapfrogging_(strategy)</b></span> across the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span>, including successfully attacking <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> task force arrived off <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span> in mid summer. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> then proceeded to besiege, capture and burn <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>. They then headed south down the coast of <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>, en route to complete the final objective of the campaign—punish <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>.

<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> sailed down the coast of <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>, and landed at the bay of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, roughly 25 miles (40 km) from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, on the advice of the exiled <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span> (who had accompanied the expedition).[42] Under the guidance of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> general with the greatest experience of fighting the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> army marched quickly to block the two exits from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Great_Plains</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, and prevent the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> moving inland.[43][44] At the same time, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>'s greatest runner, <span style='color: blue'><b>Pheidippides</b></span> (or Philippides in some accounts) had been sent to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> to request that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartan army</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> march to the aid of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>.[45] <span style='color: blue'><b>Pheidippides</b></span> arrived during the festival of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Carneia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Carnea</b></span>, a sacrosanct period of peace, and was informed that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartan army</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> could not march to war until the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>full moon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Full_moon</b></span> rose; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> could not expect reinforcement for at least ten days.[43] The Athenians would have to hold out at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> for the time being, although they were reinforced by the full muster of 1,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> from the small <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>; a gesture which did much to steady the nerves of the Athenians,[43] and won <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>unending</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Unending</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> gratitude to <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>.
<br>
<br>For approximately five days the armies therefore confronted each other across the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Great_Plains</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> in stalemate.[43] The flanks of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> camp were protected either by a grove of trees, or an abbatis of stakes (depending on the exact reading).[46][47] Since every day brought the arrival of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> closer, the delay worked in favor of the Athenians.[43] There were ten <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>strategoi</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Strategos</b></span> (generals) at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, elected by each of the ten tribes that the Athenians were divided into; <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> was one of these.[48] In addition, in overall charge, was the War-Archon (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>polemarch</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Polemarch</b></span>), <span style='color: blue'><b>Callimachus</b></span>, who had been elected by the whole citizen body.[49] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> suggests that command rotated between the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>strategoi</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Strategos</b></span>, each taking in turn a day to command the army.[50] He further suggests that each <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>strategos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Strategos</b></span>, on his day in command, instead deferred to <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span>.[50] In <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s account, <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> is keen to attack the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> (despite knowing that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> are coming to aid the Athenians), but strangely, chooses to wait until his actual day of command to attack.[50] This passage is undoubtedly problematic; the Athenians had little to gain by attacking before the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> arrived,[51] and there is no real evidence of this rotating generalship.[52] There does, however, seem to have been a delay between the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> arrival at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>; <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, who evidently believed that <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> was eager to attack, may have made a mistake whilst seeking to explain this delay.[52]
<br>
<br>As is discussed below, the reason for the delay was probably simply that neither the Athenians nor the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were willing to risk <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> initially.[51][53] This then raises the question of why the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> occurred when it did. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> explicitly tells us that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> attacked the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> (and the other sources confirm this), but it is not clear why they did this before the arrival of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>.[51] There are two main theories to explain this.[51]
<br>
<br>The first theory is that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> left <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> for an unspecified reason, and that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> moved to take advantage of this by attacking. This theory is based on the absence of any mention of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' account of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, and an entry in the <span style='color: blue'><b>Suda</b></span> dictionary.[51] The entry χωρίς ἰππεῖς ("without <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>") is explained thus:
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> left. When Datis surrendered and was ready for retreat, the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> climbed the trees and gave the Athenians the signal that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> had left. And when <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> realized that, he attacked and thus won. From there comes the above-mentioned quote, which is used when someone breaks ranks before <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>.[54]
<br>
<br>There are many variations of this theory, but perhaps the most prevalent is that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> were completing the time-consuming process of re-embarking on the ships, and were to be sent by sea to attack (undefended) <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> in the rear, whilst the rest of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> pinned down the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> army at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>.[43] This theory therefore utilises <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' suggestion that after <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army began to re-embark, intending to sail around <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cape Sounion</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sounion</b></span> to attack <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> directly.[55] Thus, this re-embarcation would have occurred before the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> (and indeed have triggered the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>).[53]
<br>
<br>The second theory is simply that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> occurred because the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> finally moved to attack the Athenians.[51] Although this theory has the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> moving to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>strategic offensive</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Offensive_(military)</b></span>, this can be reconciled with the traditional account of the Athenians attacking the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> by assuming that, seeing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> advancing, the Athenians took the tactical offensive, and attacked them.[51] Obviously, it cannot be firmly established which theory (if either) is correct. However, both theories imply that there was some kind of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> activity which occurred on or about the fifth day which ultimately triggered the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>.[51] It is also possible that both theories are correct: when the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> sent the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> by ship to attack <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, they simultaneously sent their infantry to attack at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, triggering the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek counterattack</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> mentions for several events a date in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>lunisolar calendar</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chinese_calendar</b></span>, of which each <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city-state</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Polis</b></span> used a variant. Astronomical computation allows us to derive an absolute date in the proleptic <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Julian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Julian_calendar</b></span> which is much used by historians as the chronological frame. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Philipp August Böckh</span> <span style='color: green'><b>August_Böckh</b></span> in 1855 concluded that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> took place on September 12, 490 BC in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Julian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Julian_calendar</b></span>, and this is the conventionally accepted date.[56] However, this depends on when exactly the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> held their festival and it is possible that the Spartan calendar was one month ahead of that of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>. In that case the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> took place on August 12, 490 BC.[56]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> does not give a figure for the size of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> army. However, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cornelius Nepos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cornelius_Nepos</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> all give the figure of 9,000 Athenians and 1,000 Plataeans;[57][58][59] while Justin suggests that there were 10,000 Athenians and 1,000 Plataeans.[60] These numbers are highly comparable to the number of troops <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> says that the Athenians and Plataeans sent to the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> 11 years later.[61] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span> noticed on the monument to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> the names of former slaves who were freed in exchange for military services.[62] Modern historians generally accept these numbers as reasonable.[43][63] The areas ruled by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> (<span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>) had a population of 315,000 at this time including slaves, which implies the full <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> army at the times of both <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> numbered about 3% of the population.[64]

<br>According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, the fleet sent by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> consisted of 600 triremes.[65] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> does not estimate the size of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army, only saying that they were a "large infantry that was well packed".[66] Among ancient sources, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>poet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Poetry</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Simonides</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Simonides_of_Ceos</b></span>, another near-contemporary, says the campaign force numbered 200,000; while a later writer, the Roman <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cornelius Nepos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cornelius_Nepos</b></span> estimates 200,000 infantry and 10,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>, of which only 100,000 fought in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, while the rest were loaded into the fleet that was rounding <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cape Sounion</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sounion</b></span>;[67] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span> both independently give 300,000, as does the <span style='color: blue'><b>Suda</b></span> dictionary.[59][68][69] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plato</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Lysias</b></span> give 500,000;[70][71] and Justinus 600,000.[72]
<br>
<br>Modern historians have proposed wide-ranging numbers for the infantry, from 20,000–100,000 with a consensus of perhaps 25,000;[73][74][75][76] estimates for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> are in the range of 1,000.[77]
<br>
<br>From a strategic point of view, the Athenians had some disadvantages at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>. In order to face the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, the Athenians had to summon all available <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>;[43] and even then they were still probably outnumbered at least 2 to 1.[47] Furthermore, raising such a large army had denuded <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> of defenders, and thus any secondary attack in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> rear would cut the army off from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>; and any direct attack on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> could not be defended against.[53] Still further, defeat at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> would mean the complete defeat of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, since no other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> army existed. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> strategy was therefore to keep the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army pinned down at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, blocking both exits from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Great_Plains</b></span>, and thus preventing themselves from being outmaneuvered.[43] However, these disadvantages were balanced by some advantages. The Athenians initially had no need to seek <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, since they had managed to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>confine</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Confine</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Great_Plains</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>. Furthermore, time worked in their favour, as every day brought the arrival of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> closer.[43][51] Having everything to lose by attacking, and much to gain by waiting, the Athenians remained on the defensive in the run up to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>.[51] Tactically, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> were vulnerable to attacks by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>, and since the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> had substantial numbers of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>, this made any offensive maneuver by the Athenians even more of a risk, and thus reinforced the defensive strategy of the Athenians.[53]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> strategy, on the other hand, was probably principally determined by tactical considerations. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> infantry was evidently lightly armoured, and no match for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> in a head-on confrontation (as would be demonstrated at the later battles of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>.[78]) Since the Athenians seem to have taken up a strong defensive position at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> hesitance was probably a reluctance to attack the Athenians head-on.[53]
<br>
<br>Whatever event eventually triggered the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, it obviously altered the strategic or tactical balance sufficiently to induce the Athenians to attack the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. If the first theory is correct (see above), then the absence of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> removed the main <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> tactical disadvantage, and the threat of being outflanked made it <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>imperative</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Imperative_mood</b></span> to attack.[53] Conversely, if the second theory is correct, then the Athenians were merely reacting to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> attacking them.[51] Since the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> force obviously contained a high proportion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>missile</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Missile</b></span> troops, a static defensive position would have made little sense for the Athenians;[79] the strength of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> was in the melee, and the sooner that could be brought about, the better, from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> point of view.[78] If the second theory is correct, this raises the further question of why the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, having hesitated for several days, then attacked. There may have been several strategic reasons for this; perhaps they were aware (or suspected) that the Athenians were expecting reinforcements.[51] Alternatively, since they may have felt the need to force some kind of victory—they could hardly remain at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> indefinitely.[51]
<br>
<br>"They crashed into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army with tremendous force", illustration by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Walter Crane</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Walter_Crane</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mary Macgregor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mary_MacGregor</b></span>, The Story of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> Told to Boys and Girls, <span style='color: blue'><b>London</b></span>: T.C. & E.C. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Jack</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Jack_Harkness</b></span>.
<br>The distance between the two armies at the point of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> had narrowed to "a distance not less than 8 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>stadia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_units_of_measurement</b></span>" or about 1,500 meters.[80] <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> ordered the two tribes forming the center of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> formation, the Leontis tribe led by <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue'><b>Antiochis</b></span> tribe led by Aristides, to be arranged in the depth of four ranks while the rest of the tribes at their flanks were in ranks of eight.[81][82] Some modern commentators have suggested this was a deliberate ploy to encourage a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>double envelopment</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pincer_movement</b></span> of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> centre. However, this suggests a level of training that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> are thought not to have possessed.[83] There is little evidence for any such tactical thinking in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> battles until <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leuctra</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Leuctra</b></span> in 371 BC.[84] It is therefore possible that this arrangement was made, perhaps at the last moment, so that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> line was as long as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> line, and would not therefore be outflanked.[53][85]
<br>
<br>When the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> line was ready, according to one source, the simple signal to advance was given by <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span>: "At them".[53] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> implies the Athenians ran the whole distance to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> lines, a feat under the weight of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> armory generally thought to be physically impossible.[86][87] More likely, they marched until they reached the limit of the archers' effectiveness, the "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>beaten zone</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Field_of_fire_(weaponry)</b></span>" (roughly 200 meters), and then broke into a run towards their enemy.[87] Another possibility is that they ran up to the 200 meter-mark in broken ranks, and then reformed for the march into <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> from there. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> suggests that this was the first time a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army ran into <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> in this way; this was probably because it was the first time that a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army had faced an enemy composed primarily of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>missile</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Missile</b></span> troops.[87] All this was evidently much to the surprise of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>; "... in their minds they charged the Athenians with madness which must be fatal, seeing that they were few and yet were pressing forwards at a run, having neither <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> nor archers".[88] Indeed, based on their previous experience of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> might be excused for this; <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> tells us that the Athenians at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> were "first to endure looking at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> dress and men wearing it, for up until then just hearing the name of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span> caused the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> to panic".[80] Passing through the hail of arrows launched by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army, protected for the most part by their armour, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> line finally made contact with the enemy army. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> wings quickly routed the inferior <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> levies on the flanks, before turning inwards to surround the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> centre, which had been more successful against the thin <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> centre.<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>[89</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Effects_of_Hurricane_Sandy_in_New_York</b></span>] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> ended when the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> centre then broke in panic towards their ships, pursued by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>[89</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Effects_of_Hurricane_Sandy_in_New_York</b></span>] Some, unaware of the local terrain, ran towards the swamps where unknown numbers drowned.[62][90] The Athenians pursued the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> back to their ships, and managed to capture seven ships, though the majority were able to launch successfully.[55][91] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> recounts the story that <span style='color: blue'><b>Cynaegirus</b></span>, brother of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>playwright</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Theatre</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeschylus</b></span>, who was also among the fighters, charged into the sea, grabbed one <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>trireme</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Trireme</b></span>, and started pulling it towards shore. A member of the crew saw him, cut off his hand, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Cynaegirus</b></span> died.[91]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> records that 6,400 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> bodies were counted on the battlefield, and it is unknown how many more perished in the swamps.[92] He also reported that the Athenians lost 192 men and the Plataeans 11.[92] Among the dead were the war <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>archon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archon</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Callimachus</b></span> and the general Stesilaos.[91]
<br>
<br>There are several explanations of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> success. Most scholars believe that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> had better equipment and used superior tactics. According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> were better equipped. They did not use bronze upper <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>body armour</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Body_armor</b></span> at this time, but that of leather or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>linen</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Linen</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx formation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> proved successful, because the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> had a long tradition in hand-to-hand combat, whereas the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> soldiers were accustomed to a very different kind of conflict. At <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, the Athenians thinned their centre in order to make their army equal in length to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army,[93] not as a result of a tactical planning.[94] It seems that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> centre tried to return, realizing that their wings had broken, and was caught in the flanks by the victorious <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> wings. Lazenby (1993) believes that the ultimate reason for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> success was the courage the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> displayed:
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> was won because ordinary, amateur soldiers found the courage to break into a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>trot</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Horse_gait</b></span> when the arrows begun to fall, instead of grinding to a halt, and when surprisingly the enemy wings fled, not to take the easy way out and follow them, but to stop and somehow come to the aid of the hard pressured centre.[95]
<br>
<br>According to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Vic Hurley</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vic_Hurley</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> defeat is explained by the "complete failure ... to field a representative army", calling the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> the "most convincing" example of the fact that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>infantry-bowmen</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sparabara</b></span> cannot defend any position while stationed in close-quarters and unsupported[96] (i.e. by fortifications, or failing to support them by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> and chariots, as was the common <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> tactic).

<br>In the immediate aftermath of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> says that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet sailed around <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cape Sounion</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sounion</b></span> to attack <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> directly.[55] As has been discussed above, some modern historians place this attempt just before the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>. Either way, the Athenians evidently realised that their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> was still under threat, and marched as quickly as possible back to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>.[97] The two tribes which had been in the centre of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> line stayed to guard the battlefield under the command of Aristides.[98] The Athenians arrived in time to prevent the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> from securing a landing, and seeing that the opportunity was lost, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> turned about and returned to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>.[97] Connected with this episode, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> recounts a rumour that this manoeuver by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> had been planned in conjunction with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alcmaeonids</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alcmaeonidae</b></span>, the prominent <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> aristocratic family, and that a "shield-signal" had been given after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>.[55] Although many interpretations of this have been offered, it is impossible to tell whether this was true, and if so, what exactly the signal meant.[99] On the next day, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartan army</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> arrived at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, having covered the 220 kilometers (140 mi) in only three days. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> toured the battlefield at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, and agreed that the Athenians had won a great victory.[100]

<br>In the meanwhile, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>; however, in 486 BC, his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> expedition.[17] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> then died whilst preparing to march on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</b></span>, and the throne of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> passed to his son <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>.[101] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> crushed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemy_V_Epiphanes</b></span>, and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[102] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>epic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Epic_poetry</b></span> second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> finally began in 480 BC, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> met with initial success at the battles of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span>.[103] However, defeat at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> would be the turning point in the campaign,[104] and the next year the expedition was ended by the decisive <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> victory at the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>.[105]

<br>The defeat at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> barely touched the vast resources of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> empire, yet for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> it was an enormously significant victory. It was the first time the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> had beaten the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, proving that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were not invincible, and that resistance, rather than subjugation, was possible.[106]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> was a defining moment for the young <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span>, showing what might be achieved through unity and self-belief; indeed, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> effectively marks the start of a "golden age" for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>.[107] This was also applicable to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> as a whole; "their victory endowed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> with a faith in their destiny that was to endure for three centuries, during which western culture was born".[6][108] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>John Stuart Mill</span> <span style='color: green'><b>John_Stuart_Mill</b></span>'s famous opinion was that "the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, even as an event in British history, is more important than the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Hastings</b></span>".[109] It seems that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>playwright</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Theatre</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeschylus</b></span> considered his participation at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> to be his greatest achievement in life (rather than his plays) since on his gravestone there was the following <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>epigram</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Epigram</b></span>:
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Euphorion</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Euphorion_of_Chalcis</b></span>'s son and fruitful <span style='color: blue'><b>Gela</b></span>'s pride.

<br>And long-haired <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>, who knew it all too well.[110]
<br>Militarily, a major lesson for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> was the potential of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span>.

<br>The most famous legend associated with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> is that of the runner <span style='color: blue'><b>Pheidippides</b></span> (or Philippides) bringing news to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, which is described below.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Pheidippides</b></span>' run to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> to bring aid has other legends associated with it. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> mentions that <span style='color: blue'><b>Pheidippides</b></span> was visited by the god Pan on his way to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> (or perhaps on his return journey).[43] Pan asked why the Athenians did not honor him and the awed <span style='color: blue'><b>Pheidippides</b></span> promised that they would do so from then on. The god apparently felt that the promise would be kept, so he appeared in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> and at the crucial moment he instilled the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> with his own brand of fear, the mindless, frenzied fear that bore his name: "panic". After the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, a sacred precinct was established for Pan in a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>grotto</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Grotto</b></span> on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>north slope</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alaska_North_Slope</b></span> of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Acropolis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Acropolis_of_Athens</b></span>, and a sacrifice was annually offered.[113]
<br>
<br>Similarly, after the victory the festival of the Agroteras Thysia ("sacrifice to the Agrotéra") was held at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Agrae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athens</b></span> near <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, in honor of <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemis</b></span> Agrotera ("<span style='color: blue'><b>Artemis</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Huntress</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_Amalgam_Comics_characters</b></span>"). This was in fulfillment of a vow made by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> before the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, to offer in sacrifice a number of goats equal to that of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> slain in the conflict. The number was so great, it was decided to offer 500 goats yearly until the number was filled. <span style='color: blue'><b>Xenophon</b></span> notes that at his time, 90 years after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, goats were still offered yearly.[114][115][116][117]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> mentions that the Athenians saw the phantom of King <span style='color: blue'><b>Theseus</b></span>, the mythical hero of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, leading the army in full <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> gear in the charge against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>,[118] and indeed he was depicted in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mural</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mural</b></span> of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Stoa Poikile</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Stoa_Poikile</b></span> fighting for the Athenians, along with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>twelve Olympian gods</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Twelve_Olympians</b></span> and other heroes.[119] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span> also tells us that:
<br>
<br>They say too that there chanced to be present in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> a man of rustic appearance and dress. Having slaughtered many of the foreigners with a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plough</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Plough</b></span> he was seen no more after the engagement. When the Athenians made enquiries at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oracle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delphi</b></span>, the god merely ordered them to honor Echetlaeus ("he of the Plough-tail") as a hero.[62]
<br>
<br>Another tale from the conflict is of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dog</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dog</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aelian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Claudius_Aelianus</b></span> relates that one <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> brought his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dog</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dog</b></span> to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> encampment. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dog</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dog</b></span> followed his master to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> and attacked the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> at his master's side. He also <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>informs</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Institute_for_Operations_Research_and_the_Management_Sciences</b></span> us that this <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dog</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dog</b></span> is depicted in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mural</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mural</b></span> of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Stoa Poikile</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Stoa_Poikile</b></span>.[120]
<br>
<br>According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> runner named <span style='color: blue'><b>Pheidippides</b></span> was sent to run from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> to ask for assistance before the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>. He ran a distance of over 225 kilometers (140 miles), arriving in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> the day after he left.[121] Then, following the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> army marched the 40 kilometers (25 miles) or so back to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> at a very high pace (considering the quantity of armour, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>fatigue</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battledress</b></span> after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>), in order to head off the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> force sailing around <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cape Sounion</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sounion</b></span>. They arrived back in the late afternoon, in time to see the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> ships turn away from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, thus completing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> victory.[122]
<br>
<br>Later, in popular imagination, these two events became confused with each other, leading to a legendary but inaccurate version of events. This myth has <span style='color: blue'><b>Pheidippides</b></span> running from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, to announce the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> victory with the word "nenikēkamen!" (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Attic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>: νενικήκαμεν; we've won!), whereupon he promptly died of exhaustion. Most accounts incorrectly attribute this story to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>[citation needed]; actually, the story first appears in <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>'s On the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Glory</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Perth_Glory_FC</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> in the 1st century AD, who quotes from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Heracleides</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Heracleides_of_Tarentum</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pontus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kingdom_of_Pontus</b></span>'s lost work, giving the runner's name as either Thersipus of Erchius or Eucles.[123] <span style='color: blue'><b>Lucian</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Samosata</b></span> (2nd century AD) gives the same story but names the runner Philippides (not <span style='color: blue'><b>Pheidippides</b></span>).[124] It should be noted that in some medieval <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>codices</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Codex</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> the name of the runner between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> before the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> is given as Philippides, and this name is also preferred in a few modern editions.[125]
<br>
<br>When the idea of a modern Olympics became a reality at the end of the 19th century, the initiators and organizers were looking for a great popularizing event, recalling the ancient glory of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[126] The idea of organizing a "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Marathon</b></span> race" came from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Michel Bréal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Michel_Bréal</b></span>, who wanted the event to feature in the first modern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympic Games</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Olympic_Games</b></span> in 1896 in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>. This idea was heavily supported by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pierre de Coubertin</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pierre_de_Coubertin</b></span>, the founder of the modern Olympics, as well as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[126] This would echo the legendary version of events, with the competitors running from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>. So popular was this event that it quickly caught on, becoming a fixture at the Olympic games, with major cities staging their own annual events.[126] The distance eventually became fixed at 26 miles 385 yards, or 42.195 km, though for the first years it was variable, being around 25 miles (40 km)—the approximate distance from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>
