The History of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>: Ἱστορίαι, "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span>") is a historical account of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> (431–404 BC), which was fought between the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_League</b></span> (led by <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>) and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> (led by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>). It was written by <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>, an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> historian who also happened to serve as an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> general during the war. His account of the conflict is widely considered to be a classic and regarded as one of the earliest scholarly works of history. The History is divided into eight books.
<br>
<br>Analyses of the History generally occur in one of two camps.[1] On the one hand, some scholars view the work as an objective and scientific piece of history. The judgment of J. B. <span style='color: blue'><b>Bury</b></span> reflects his traditional interpretation of the work: "[The History is] severe in its detachment, written from a purely intellectual point of view, unencumbered with platitudes and moral judgments, cold and critical."[2]
<br>
<br>On the other hand, in keeping with more recent interpretations that are associated with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>reader-response criticism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Reader-response_criticism</b></span>, the History can be read as a piece of literature rather than an objective record of the historical events. This view is embodied in the words of W. R. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Connor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_Assassin's_Creed_characters</b></span>, who describes <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> as "an artist who responds to, selects and skillfully arranges his material, and develops its symbolic and emotional potential."[3]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> is considered to be one of the great "fathers" of Western history, thus making his methodology the subject of much analysis in area of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>historiography</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Historiography</b></span>.[citation needed]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> is one of the first western historians to employ a strict standard of chronology, recording events by year, with each year consisting of the summer campaign season and a less active winter season. This method contrasts sharply with <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> also makes extensive use of speeches in order to elaborate on the event in question. While the inclusion of long <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>first-person</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Narration</b></span> speeches is somewhat alien to modern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>historical method</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Historical_method</b></span>, in the context of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ancient Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oral culture</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Oral_tradition</b></span> speeches are expected. These include addresses given to troops by their generals before battles and numerous political speeches, both by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and Spartan leaders, as well as debates between various parties. Of the speeches, the most famous is the funeral oration of <span style='color: blue'><b>Pericles</b></span>, which is found in Book Two. <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> undoubtedly heard some of these speeches himself while for others he relied on eyewitness accounts.
<br>
<br>These speeches are suspect in the eyes of Classicists, however, inasmuch as it is not sure to what degree <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> altered these speeches in order to most clearly elucidate the crux of the argument presented. Some of the speeches are probably fabricated according to his expectations of, as he puts it, "what was called for in each situation" (1.22.1).[4]
<br>
<br>Despite being an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and a participant in the conflict, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> is often regarded as having written a generally unbiased account of the conflict with respect to the sides involved in it. In the introduction to the piece he states, "my work is not a piece of writing designed to meet the taste of an immediate public, but was done to last for ever" (1.22.4).
<br>
<br>There are scholars, however, who doubt this. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ernst Badian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ernst_Badian</b></span>, for example has argued that <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> has a strong pro-Athenian bias.[5] In keeping with this sort of doubt, other scholars claim that <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> had an ulterior motive in his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, specifically to create an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>epic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Epic_poetry</b></span> comparable to those of the past such as the works of <span style='color: blue'><b>Homer</b></span>, and that this led him to create a nonobjective <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dualism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dualism</b></span> favoring the Athenians.[6] The work does display a clear bias against certain people involved in the conflict, such as <span style='color: blue'><b>Cleon</b></span>.[7]
<br>
<br>The gods play no active role in <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>' work. This is very different from <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, who frequently mentions the role of the gods, as well as a nearly ubiquitous divine presence in the centuries-earlier poems of <span style='color: blue'><b>Homer</b></span>. Instead, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> regards history as being caused by the choices and actions of human beings.
<br>
<br>Despite the absence of actions of the gods, religion and piety play critical roles in the actions of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, and to a lesser degree, the Athenians.[8] Thus natural occurrences such as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>earthquake</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Earthquake</b></span> and eclipses were viewed as religiously significant (1.23.3; 7.50.4)[9]
<br>
<br>Despite the absence of the gods from <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>' work, he still draws heavily from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek mythos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_mythology</b></span>, especially from <span style='color: blue'><b>Homer</b></span>, whose works are prominent in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek mythology</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_mythology</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> references <span style='color: blue'><b>Homer</b></span> frequently as a source of information, but always <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>adds</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Applied_Digital_Data_Systems</b></span> a distancing <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>clause</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Clause</b></span>, such as "<span style='color: blue'><b>Homer</b></span> shows this, if that is sufficient evidence," and "assuming we should <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>trust</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Trust_law</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Homer</b></span>'s poetry in this case too."[10]
<br>
<br>However, despite <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>' lack of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>trust</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Trust_law</b></span> in information that was not experienced firsthand, such as <span style='color: blue'><b>Homer</b></span>'s, he does use the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>poet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Poetry</b></span>'s epics to infer facts about the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Trojan War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Trojan_War</b></span>. For instance, while <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> considered the number of over 1,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> ships sent to <span style='color: blue'><b>Troy</b></span> to be a poetic exaggeration, he uses <span style='color: blue'><b>Homer</b></span>'s Catalog of Ships to determine the approximate number of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> soldiers who were present. Later, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> claims that since <span style='color: blue'><b>Homer</b></span> never makes reference to a united <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> state, the pre-Hellenic nations must have been so <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>disjointed</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Disjointed</b></span> that they could not organize properly to launch an effective campaign. In fact, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> claims that <span style='color: blue'><b>Troy</b></span> could have been conquered in half the time had the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> leaders allocated resources properly and not sent a large portion of the army on raids for supplies.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> makes sure to inform his reader that he, unlike <span style='color: blue'><b>Homer</b></span>, is not a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>poet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Poetry</b></span> prone to exaggeration, but instead a historian, whose stories may not give "momentary pleasure," but "whose intended meaning will be challenged by the truth of the facts."[11] By distancing himself from the storytelling practices of <span style='color: blue'><b>Homer</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> makes it clear that while he does consider <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mythology</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mythology</b></span> and epics to be evidence, these works cannot be given much credibility, and that it takes an impartial and empirically minded historian, such as himself, to accurately portray the events of the past.
<br>
<br>The first book of the History, after a brief review of early <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> history and some programmatic <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>historiographical</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Historiography</b></span> commentary, seeks to explain why the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> broke out when it did and what its causes were. Except for a few short excursuses (notably 6.54–58 on the Tyrant <span style='color: blue'><b>Slayers</b></span>), the remainder of the History (books 2 through 8) rigidly maintains its focus on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> to the exclusion of other topics.
<br>
<br>While the History concentrates on the military aspects of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span>, it uses these events as a medium to suggest several other themes closely related to the war. It specifically discusses in several passages the socially and culturally degenerative effects of war on humanity itself. The History is especially concerned with the lawlessness and atrocities committed by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> citizens to each other in the name of one side or another in the war. Some events depicted in the History, such as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Melian dialogue</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege_of_Melos</b></span>, describe early instances of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>realpolitik</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Realpolitik</b></span> or power politics.
<br>
<br>The History is preoccupied with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>interplay</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Interplay_Entertainment</b></span> of justice and power in political and military decision-making. <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>' presentation is <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>decidedly</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Decidedly</b></span> ambivalent on this theme. While the History seems to suggest that considerations of justice are artificial and necessarily capitulate to power, it sometimes also shows a significant degree of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>empathy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Empathy</b></span> with those who suffer from the exigencies of the war.
<br>
<br>For the most part, the History does not discuss topics such as the art and architecture of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The History emphasizes the development of military technologies. In several passages (1.14.3, 2.75–76, 7.36.2–3), <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> describes in detail various innovations in the conduct of siegeworks or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>naval warfare</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naval_warfare</b></span>. The History places great importance upon naval supremacy, arguing that a modern empire is impossible without a strong navy. He states that this is the result of the development of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>piracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Piracy</b></span> and coastal settlements in earlier <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Important in this regard was the development, at the beginning of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>classical</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_antiquity</b></span> period (c. 500 BC), of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>trireme</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Trireme</b></span>, the supreme <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>naval ship</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naval_ship</b></span> for the next several hundred years. In his emphasis on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sea power</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naval_warfare</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> resembles the modern naval theorist <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alfred</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alfred_the_Great</b></span> Thayer <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mahan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alfred_Thayer_Mahan</b></span>, whose influential work The Influence of Sea Power upon History helped set in motion the naval <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>arms race</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Arms_race</b></span> prior to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>World War I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>World_War_I</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The History explains that the primary cause of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> was the "growth in power of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, and the alarm which this inspired in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>" (1.23.6). <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> traces the development of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> power through the growth of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> in the years 479 BC to 432 BC in book one of the History (1.89–118). The legitimacy of the empire is explored in several passages, notably in the speech at 1.73–78, where an anonymous <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>legation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Papal_legate</b></span> defends the empire on the grounds that it was freely given to the Athenians and not taken by force. The subsequent expansion of the empire is defended by these Athenians, "...the nature of the case first compelled us to advance our empire to its present height; fear being our principal motive, though honor and interest came afterward." (1.75.3)
<br>
<br>The Athenians also argue that, "We have done nothing extraordinary, nothing contrary to human nature in accepting an empire when it was offered to us and then in refusing to give it up." (1.76) They claim that anyone in their position would act in the same fashion. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> represent a more traditional, circumspect, and less expansive power. Indeed, the Athenians are nearly destroyed by their greatest act of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>imperial overreach</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Imperial_overstretch</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sicilian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sicily</b></span> expedition, described in books six and seven of the History.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> correlates, in his description of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>426 BC Malian Gulf tsunami</span> <span style='color: green'><b>426_BC_Malian_Gulf_tsunami</b></span>, for the first time in the recorded history of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>natural science</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Science</b></span>, quakes and waves in terms of cause and effect.[12][13]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>' History is extraordinarily dense and complex. His particular <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ancient Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> prose is also very challenging, grammatically, syntactically, and semantically. This has resulted in much scholarly disagreement on a cluster of issues of interpretation.
<br>
<br>It is commonly thought that <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> died while still working on the History, since it ends in mid-sentence and only goes up to 410 BC, leaving six years of war uncovered. Furthermore, there is a great deal of uncertainty whether he intended to revise the sections he had already written. Since there appear to be some contradictions between certain passages in the History, it has been proposed that the conflicting passages were written at different times and that <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>' opinion on the conflicting matter had changed. Those who argue that the History can be divided into various levels of composition are usually called "analysts" and those who argue that the passages must be made to reconcile with one another are called "unitarians". This conflict is called the "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>strata</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Stratigraphy</b></span> of composition" debate. The lack of progress in this debate over the course of the twentieth century has caused many <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thucydidean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thucydides</b></span> scholars to declare the debate insoluble and to side-step the issue in their work.
<br>
<br>The History is notoriously reticent about its sources. <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> almost never names his informants and alludes to competing versions of events only a handful of times. This is in marked contrast to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, who frequently mentions multiple versions of his stories and allows the reader to decide which is true. Instead, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> strives to create the impression of a seamless and irrefutable narrative. Nevertheless, scholars have sought to detect the sources behind the various sections of the History. For example, the narrative after <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>' exile (4.108ff.) seems to focus on Peloponnesian events more than the first four books, leading to the conclusion that he had greater access to Peloponnesian sources at that time.
<br>
<br>Frequently, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> appears to assert knowledge of the thoughts of individuals at key moments in the narrative. Scholars have asserted that these moments are evidence that he interviewed these individuals after the fact. However, the evidence of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sicilian Expedition</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sicilian_Expedition</b></span> argues against this, since <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> discusses the thoughts of the generals who died there and whom he would have had no chance to interview. Instead it seems likely that, as with the speeches, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> is looser than previously thought in inferring the thoughts, feelings, and motives of principal characters in his History from their actions, as well as his own sense of what would be appropriate or likely in such a situation.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The historian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Historian</b></span> J. B. <span style='color: blue'><b>Bury</b></span> writes that the work of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> . . . "marks the longest and most decisive step that has ever been taken by a single man towards making history what it is today.”[14]
<br>
<br>Historian H. D. Kitto feels that <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> wrote about the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> not because it was the most significant war in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>antiquity</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> but because it caused the most suffering. Indeed, several passages of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>' book are written "with an intensity of feeling hardly exceeded by <span style='color: blue'><b>Sappho</b></span> herself."[15]
<br>
<br>In his Open Society and Its Enemies, Karl R. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Popper</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Karl_Popper</b></span> writes that <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> was the "greatest historian, perhaps, who ever lived." <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>' work, however, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Popper</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Karl_Popper</b></span> goes on to say, represents "an interpretation, a point of view; and in this we need not agree with him." In the war between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span> and the "arrested <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oligarchic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Oligarchy</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tribalism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tribalism</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>," we must never forget <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>' "involuntary bias," and that "his heart was not with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, his native <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>:"
<br>
<br>"Although he apparently did not belong to the extreme wing of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oligarchic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Oligarchy</b></span> clubs who conspired throughout the war with the enemy, he was certainly a member of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oligarchic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Oligarchy</b></span> party, and a friend neither of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> people, the demos, who had exiled him, nor of its <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>imperialist</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Imperialism</b></span> policy."
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>' History has been enormously influential in both ancient and modern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>historiography</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Historiography</b></span>. It was embraced by many of the author's contemporaries and immediate successors with enthusiasm; indeed, many authors sought to complete the unfinished history. For example, <span style='color: blue'><b>Xenophon</b></span> wrote his <span style='color: blue'><b>Hellenica</b></span> as a continuation of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>' work, beginning at the exact moment that <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>' History leaves off. <span style='color: blue'><b>Xenophon</b></span>'s work, however, is generally considered inferior in style and accuracy compared with <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'.[citation needed] In later <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>antiquity</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>' reputation suffered somewhat, with critics such as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dionysius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus</b></span> rejecting the History as turgid and excessively austere. <span style='color: blue'><b>Lucian</b></span> also parodies it (among others) in his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satire</b></span> The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>True Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>True_History</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Woodrow Wilson</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Woodrow_Wilson</b></span> read the History on his voyage across the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Atlantic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Atlantic</b></span> to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Versailles Peace Conference</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Paris_Peace_Conference,_1919</b></span>.[16]
<br>
<br>Most critics writing about the History, including this article, use a standard format to direct readers to passages in the text: book.chapter.section. For example, the notation that <span style='color: blue'><b>Pericles</b></span>' last speech runs from 2.60.1 to 2.64.6, this means that it can be found in the second book, from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sixtieth</span> <span style='color: green'><b>60th_United_States_Congress</b></span> chapter through the sixty-fourth.
