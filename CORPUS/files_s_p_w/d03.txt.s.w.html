<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ancient Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span>, also known as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, historic region of southwestern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> that is only roughly coterminous with modern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span>. The term <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> was used for centuries, chiefly in the West, to designate those regions where <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian language</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persian_language</b></span> and culture predominated, but it more correctly refers to a region of southern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span> formerly known as Persis, alternatively as Pārs or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Parsa</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persepolis</b></span>, modern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Fārs</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Fars_Province</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Parsa</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persepolis</b></span> was the name of an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Indo-European</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Indo-European_languages</b></span> nomadic people who migrated into the region about 1000 BC. The first mention of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Parsa</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persepolis</b></span> occurs in the annals of Shalmanesar II, an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyrian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Assyria</b></span> king, in 844 BC. During the rule of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> dynasty (559–330 BC), the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ancient Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> first encountered the inhabitants of Persis on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iranian plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iranian_Plateau</b></span>, when the Achaemenids—natives of Persis—were expanding their political <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sphere</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spherical_Earth</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenids</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were the dominant dynasty during <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_language</b></span> history until the time of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span>, and the use of the name <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> was gradually extended by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and other peoples to apply to the whole <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iranian plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iranian_Plateau</b></span>. This tendency was reinforced with the rise of the Sāsānian dynasty, also native to Persis, whose culture dominated the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iranian plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iranian_Plateau</b></span> until the 7th century AD. The people of this area have traditionally referred to the region as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span>, Land of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aryans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Indo-Iranians</b></span>, and in 1935 the government of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span> requested that the name <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span> be used in lieu of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span>. The two terms, however, are often used interchangeably when referring to periods preceding the 20th century.

<br>
<br>The early history of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span> may be divided into three phases: (1) the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>prehistoric</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Prehistory</b></span> period, beginning with the earliest evidence of humans on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iranian plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iranian_Plateau</b></span> (c. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>100,000 BC</span> <span style='color: green'><b>An_Unearthly_Child</b></span>) and ending roughly at the start of the 1st millennium BC, (2) the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>protohistoric</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Protohistory</b></span> period, covering approximately the first half of the 1st millennium BC, and (3) the period of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> dynasty (6th to 4th century BC), when <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span> entered the full light of written history. The civilization of <span style='color: blue'><b>Elam</b></span>, centred off the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Plateau</b></span> in lowland Khūzestān, is an exception, for written history began there as early as it did in neighbouring <span style='color: blue'><b>Mesopotamia</b></span> (c. 3000 BC).
<br>
<br>The sources for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>prehistoric</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Prehistory</b></span> period are entirely archaeological. Early excavation in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span> was limited to a few sites. In the 1930s archaeological exploration increased, but work was abruptly halted by the outbreak of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>World War II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>World_War_II</b></span>. After the war ended, interest in Iranian archaeology revived quickly, and, from 1950 until archaeological study was dramatically curtailed after 1979, numerous excavations revolutionized the study of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>prehistoric</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Prehistory</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span>.
<br>
<br>For the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>protohistoric</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Protohistory</b></span> period the historian is still forced to rely primarily on archaeological evidence, but much information comes from written sources as well. None of these sources, however, is both local and contemporary in relation to the events described. Some sources are contemporary but belong to neighbouring civilizations that were only tangentially involved in events in the Iranian plateau—for example, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyrian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Akkadian_language</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Akkadian_language</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cuneiform records</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cuneiform_Records</b></span> from lowland <span style='color: blue'><b>Mesopotamia</b></span>. Some are local but not contemporary, such as the traditional Iranian legends and tales that supposedly speak of events in the early 1st millennium BC. And some are neither contemporary nor local but are nevertheless valuable in reconstructing events in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>protohistoric</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Protohistory</b></span> period (e.g., the 5th-century-BC <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>).
<br>
<br>For the study of the centuries of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> dynasty, there is sufficient documentary material so that this period is the earliest for which archaeology is not the primary source of data. Contributing to the understanding of the period are, among other sources, economic texts from <span style='color: blue'><b>Mesopotamia</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Elam</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span>; historical inscriptions such as that of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> (the Great) at Behistun (modern Bīsotūn); contemporary and later <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>classical</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_antiquity</b></span> authors; and later Iranian legends and literature.
<br>
<br>Enigmatic evidence of human presence on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iranian plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iranian_Plateau</b></span> as early as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lower Paleolithic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lower_Paleolithic</b></span> times comes from a surface find in the Bākhtarān valley. The first well-documented evidence of human habitation is in deposits from several excavated <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cave</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cave</b></span> and rock-shelter sites, located mainly in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zagros Mountains</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zagros_Mountains</b></span> of western <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span> and dated to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Middle Paleolithic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Middle_Paleolithic</b></span> or <span style='color: blue'><b>Mousterian</b></span> times (c. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>100,000 BC</span> <span style='color: green'><b>An_Unearthly_Child</b></span>). There is every reason to assume, however, that future excavations will reveal <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lower Paleolithic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lower_Paleolithic</b></span> habitation in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue'><b>Mousterian</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>flint tool</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Stone_tool</b></span> industry found there is generally characterized by an absence of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Levalloisian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Levallois_technique</b></span> technique of chipping <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>flint</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Stone_tool</b></span> and thus differs from the well-defined <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Middle Paleolithic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Middle_Paleolithic</b></span> industries known elsewhere in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Middle East</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Middle_East</b></span>. The economic and social level associated with this industry is that of fairly small, peripatetic <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hunting</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hunter-gatherer</b></span> and gathering groups spread out over a thinly settled landscape.
<br>
<br>Locally, the <span style='color: blue'><b>Mousterian</b></span> is followed by an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Upper Paleolithic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Upper_Paleolithic</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>flint</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Stone_tool</b></span> industry called the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Baradostian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Baradostian_culture</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Radiocarbon dates</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Radiocarbon_dating</b></span> suggest that this is one of the earliest <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Upper Paleolithic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Upper_Paleolithic</b></span> complexes; it may have begun as early as 36,000 BC. Its relationship to neighbouring industries, however, remains unclear. Possibly, after some cultural and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>typological</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Biological_anthropology</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>discontinuity</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Continuous_function</b></span>, perhaps caused by the maximum cold of the last phase of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Würm glaciation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Last_glacial_period</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Baradostian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Baradostian_culture</b></span> was replaced by a local <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Upper Paleolithic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Upper_Paleolithic</b></span> industry called the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zarzian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zarzian_culture</b></span>. This tool tradition, probably dating to the period 12,000 to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>10,000 BC</span> <span style='color: green'><b>10th_millennium_BC</b></span>, marks the end of the Iranian <span style='color: blue'><b>Paleolithic</b></span> sequence.
<br>
<br>Evidence indicates that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Middle East</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Middle_East</b></span> in general was one of the earliest areas in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Old World</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Old_World</b></span> to experience what the Australian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>archaeologist</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archaeology</b></span> V. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Gordon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mike_Gordon</b></span> Childe called the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Neolithic revolution</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Neolithic_Revolution</b></span>. That revolution witnessed the development of settled village agricultural life based firmly on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>domestication</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Domestication</b></span> of plants and animals. <span style='color: blue'><b>Iran</b></span> has yielded much evidence on the history of these important developments. From the early <span style='color: blue'><b>Neolithic</b></span> Period (sometimes called the <span style='color: blue'><b>Mesolithic</b></span>, or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Middle Stone Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mesolithic</b></span>) comes evidence of significant shifts in tool manufacture, settlement patterns, and subsistence methods, including the fumbling beginnings of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>domestication</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Domestication</b></span> of both plants and animals, at such <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>western Iranian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Western_Iranian_languages</b></span> sites as Āsīāb, Gūrān, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ganj Dareh</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ganj_Dareh</b></span> (Ganj Darreh), and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ali Kosh</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ali_Kosh</b></span>. Similar developments in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zagros Mountains</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zagros_Mountains</b></span>, on the Iraqi side of the modern border, are also traceable at sites such as Karīm Shahīr and Zawi Chemi–Shanidar. This phase of early experimentation with sedentary life and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>domestication</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Domestication</b></span> was soon followed by a period of fully developed village <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>farming</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Agriculture</b></span> as defined at important <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zagros</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zagros_Mountains</b></span> sites such as Jarmo, Sarāb, upper <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ali Kosh</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ali_Kosh</b></span>, and upper Gūrān. All these sites date wholly or in part to the 8th and 7th millennia BC.
<br>
<br>By approximately 6000 BC these patterns of village <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>farming</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Agriculture</b></span> were widely spread over much of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iranian plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iranian_Plateau</b></span> and in lowland Khūzestān. Tepe Sabz in Khūzestān, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hajji Firuz</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hajji_Firuz</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Azerbaijan</b></span>, Godin III Tepe VII in northeastern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lorestān</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lorestan_Province</b></span>, Tepe VII <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sialk</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tepe_Sialk</b></span> I on the rim of the central salt desert, and Tepe VII <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Yahya</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Yahya_Khan</b></span> VI C–E in the southeast are all sites that have yielded evidence of fairly sophisticated patterns of agricultural life (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Roman numerals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_numerals</b></span> identify the level of excavation). Though distinctly different, all show general cultural connections with the beginnings of settled village life in neighbouring areas such as <span style='color: blue'><b>Afghanistan</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Baluchistan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Balochistan</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Central Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Central_Asia</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Mesopotamia</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Rather less is known of the cultures in this time range in <span style='color: blue'><b>Iran</b></span> than of contemporary cultures elsewhere in the ancient <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Middle East</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Middle_East</b></span>. Research has tended to concentrate on the <span style='color: blue'><b>Neolithic</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>protohistoric</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Protohistory</b></span> periods, and the scattered evidence for important cultural and artistic developments in the <span style='color: blue'><b>Chalcolithic</b></span> Period (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Copper Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chalcolithic</b></span>) and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Early Bronze Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bronze_Age</b></span> resists coherent summary. It is clear that trends that began in the late <span style='color: blue'><b>Neolithic</b></span> Period continued in the millennia that followed and that the rugged, broken landscape of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iranian plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iranian_Plateau</b></span> forced people into a variety of relatively isolated cultures. In no instance, with the important exception of <span style='color: blue'><b>Elam</b></span> (see The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Elamites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Elam</b></span>, below), did <span style='color: blue'><b>Iran</b></span> participate in the developments that led to fully urban civilization in lowland <span style='color: blue'><b>Mesopotamia</b></span> to the west or in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Indus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Indus_Valley_Civilisation</b></span> valley to the east. Throughout <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>prehistory</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Prehistory</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iranian plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iranian_Plateau</b></span> remained at the economic and cultural level of village life achieved in the <span style='color: blue'><b>Neolithic</b></span> Period. The separate cultural areas on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Plateau</b></span> are as yet barely understood by the modern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>archaeologist</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archaeology</b></span> in any terms other than through the painted <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pottery</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pottery</b></span> assemblages found at several sites throughout <span style='color: blue'><b>Iran</b></span>. Though they developed in comparative isolation, each of these areas does yield some evidence of cultural contact with its immediate neighbours and, in some striking cases, with developments in the centres of higher civilization in <span style='color: blue'><b>Mesopotamia</b></span>. Trade would appear to be the principal mechanism by which such contacts were maintained, and often <span style='color: blue'><b>Elam</b></span> appears to have acted as an intermediary between <span style='color: blue'><b>Sumer</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span> on the one hand and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Plateau</b></span> cultures on the other. Trade across the northern part of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Plateau</b></span>, through the sites of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tepe Hissar</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tepe_Hissar</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sialk</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tepe_Sialk</b></span> I, most probably involved <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>transshipping</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Transshipment</b></span> semiprecious stones such as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>lapis lazuli</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lapis_lazuli</b></span> from <span style='color: blue'><b>Afghanistan</b></span> to <span style='color: blue'><b>Mesopotamia</b></span>. The appearance of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>proto-Elamite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Proto-Elamite</b></span> tablets in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sialk</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tepe_Sialk</b></span> IV may <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>bear witness</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bear_Witness</b></span> to such trade. So also may the appearance of similar <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>proto-Elamite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Proto-Elamite</b></span> tablets at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tepe Yahya</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tepe_Yahya</b></span> south of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Kermān</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kerman</b></span> and in the great central desert provide evidence of trade connections between <span style='color: blue'><b>Mesopotamia</b></span> and the east—in this case a trade that may have centred on specific items such as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>steatite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Soapstone</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>copper</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Copper</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Parsa</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persepolis</b></span> perhaps also participated in such trade networks, as is suggested by the appearance there, alongside strictly local ceramics, of wares that have clear <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mesopotamian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mesopotamia</b></span> affinities. In the west-central <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zagros</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zagros_Mountains</b></span>, outside influences from both the north and the west can be traced in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ceramic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pottery</b></span> record; such is also the case for local cultures in <span style='color: blue'><b>Azerbaijan</b></span> to the northwest. In general, however, these millennia represent a major dark age in Iranian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>prehistory</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Prehistory</b></span> and warrant considerably more attention than they have received.
<br>
<br>The beginning of this period is generally characterized by an even more marked isolation of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Plateau</b></span> than earlier, while the latter half of the period is one of major new disruptions, heretofore unique in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iranian history</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span>, that laid the groundwork for developments in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>protohistoric</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Protohistory</b></span> period. In northwestern and central western <span style='color: blue'><b>Iran</b></span>, local cultures, as yet barely defined beyond their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ceramic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pottery</b></span> parameters, developed in relative isolation from events elsewhere. All occupation had ceased at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tepe Sialk</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tepe_Sialk</b></span>, but the painted <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pottery</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pottery</b></span> cultures characteristic of earlier <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hissar</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hisar_district</b></span> and of the sites in the Gorgān lowland in the northeast continued. Little <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mesopotamian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mesopotamia</b></span> influence is evident, though some contacts between <span style='color: blue'><b>Elam</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Plateau</b></span> remained. Beginning perhaps as early as 2400 BC but more probably somewhat later, a radical transformation occurred in the culture of the northeast: earlier painted potteries were entirely replaced by a distinctive gray or gray-black <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ceramic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pottery</b></span> associated with a variety of other artifacts, primarily weapons and ornaments in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>copper</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Copper</b></span> or bronze, which were also unique. Whether this cultural change represents a strictly local development or testifies to an important intrusion of new peoples into the area is still under debate. In any case, none of these developments can be traced to <span style='color: blue'><b>Mesopotamia</b></span> or to other areas to the west, regions which had previously been the sources of outside influences on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iranian plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iranian_Plateau</b></span>. Somewhat later the local cultures of central and northwestern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span> were apparently influenced by developments in northern <span style='color: blue'><b>Mesopotamia</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Assyria</b></span>, along patterns of contact that had been well established in earlier periods. Yet this contact, as it is observed at Godin III, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hasanlu</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Teppe_Hasanlu</b></span> VI, and Dinkha Tepe, did not cause any major <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dislocation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dislocation</b></span> of local cultural patterns. In the second half of the 2nd millennium, however, western Iran—at first perhaps gradually and then with striking suddenness—came under the influence of the gray and gray-black ware cultures that had developed earlier in the northeast. There the impact of these influences was such as to definitely suggest a major cultural <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dislocation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dislocation</b></span> and the introduction of a whole new culture—and probably a new people—into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zagros</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zagros_Mountains</b></span>. It was this development that marked the end of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bronze Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bronze_Age</b></span> in western <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span> and ushered in the early <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>protohistoric</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Protohistory</b></span> period.
<br>
<br>Whereas the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iranian plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iranian_Plateau</b></span> did not experience the rise of urban, literate civilization in the late 4th and early 3rd millennia on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mesopotamian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mesopotamia</b></span> pattern, lowland Khūzestān did. There <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Elamite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Elam</b></span> civilization was centred. Geographically, <span style='color: blue'><b>Elam</b></span> included more than Khūzestān; it was a combination of the lowlands and the immediate highland areas to the north and east. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Elamite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Elam</b></span> strength was based on an ability to hold these various areas together under a coordinated government that permitted the maximum interchange of the natural resources unique to each region. Traditionally this was done through a federated governmental structure.
<br>
<br>Closely related to that form of government was the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Elamite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Elam</b></span> system of inheritance and power distribution. The normal pattern of government was that of an overlord ruling over <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vassal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vassal</b></span> princes. In earliest times the overlord lived in <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span>, which functioned as a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>federal capital</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Islamabad</b></span>. With him ruled his brother closest in age, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>viceroy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Viceroy</b></span>, who usually had his seat of government in the native <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of the currently ruling dynasty. This <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>viceroy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Viceroy</b></span> was <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>heir presumptive</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Heir_presumptive</b></span> to the overlord. Yet a third official, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>regent</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Regent</b></span> or prince of <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span> (the district), shared power with the overlord and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>viceroy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Viceroy</b></span>. He was usually the overlord’s son or, if no son was available, his nephew. On the death of the overlord, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>viceroy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Viceroy</b></span> became overlord. The prince of <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span> remained in office, and the brother of the old <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>viceroy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Viceroy</b></span> nearest to him in age became the new <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>viceroy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Viceroy</b></span>. Only if all brothers were dead was the prince of <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span> promoted to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>viceroy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Viceroy</b></span>, thus enabling the overlord to name his own son (or nephew) as the new prince of <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span>. Such a complicated system of governmental checks, balances, and power inheritance often broke down, despite <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>bilateral descent</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bilateral_descent</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>levirate marriage</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Levirate_marriage</b></span> (the compulsory marriage of a widow to her deceased husband’s brother). What is remarkable is how often the system did work; it was only in the Middle and Neo-Elamite periods that sons more often succeeded fathers to power.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Elamite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Elam</b></span> history can be divided into three main phases: the Old, Middle, and Late, or Neo-Elamite, periods. In all periods <span style='color: blue'><b>Elam</b></span> was closely involved with <span style='color: blue'><b>Sumer</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mesopotamia</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Assyria</b></span>, sometimes through peaceful trade but more often through war. In like manner, <span style='color: blue'><b>Elam</b></span> was often a participant in events on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iranian plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iranian_Plateau</b></span>. Both involvements were related to the combined need of all the lowland civilizations to control the warlike peoples to the east and to exploit the economic resources of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Plateau</b></span>.
<br>
<br>
<br>The earliest kings in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Old Elamite period</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Elam</b></span> may date to approximately 2700 BC. Already conflict with <span style='color: blue'><b>Mesopotamia</b></span>, in this case apparently with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ur</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Third_Dynasty_of_Ur</b></span>, was characteristic of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Elamite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Elam</b></span> history. These early rulers were succeeded by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Awan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Awan_dynasty</b></span> (Shūstar) dynasty. The 11th king of this line entered into treaty relations with the great <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Naram-Sin</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naram-Sin_of_Akkad</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Akkad</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Akkadian_Empire</b></span> (reigned c. 254–c. 2218 BC). Yet a new ruling house soon appeared, the Simash dynasty (Simash may have been in the mountains of southern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lorestān</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lorestan_Province</b></span>). The outstanding event of this period was the virtual conquest of <span style='color: blue'><b>Elam</b></span> by <span style='color: blue'><b>Shulgi</b></span> of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>3rd dynasty</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Third_Dynasty_of_Egypt</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ur</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Third_Dynasty_of_Ur</b></span> (c. 2094–c. 2047 BC). Eventually the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Elamites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Elam</b></span> rose in rebellion and overthrew the 3rd <span style='color: blue'><b>Ur</b></span> dynasty, an event long remembered in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mesopotamian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mesopotamia</b></span> dirges and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>omen</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Omen</b></span> texts. About the mid 19th century BC, power in <span style='color: blue'><b>Elam</b></span> passed to a new dynasty, that of Eparti. The third king of this line, Shirukdukh, was active in various military coalitions against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>rising power</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Rising_Power</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span>, but <span style='color: blue'><b>Hammurabi</b></span> was not to be denied, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Elam</b></span> was crushed in 1764 BC. The Old <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span> kingdom, however, fell into rapid decline following the death of <span style='color: blue'><b>Hammurabi</b></span>, and it was not long before the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Elamites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Elam</b></span> were able to gain revenge. Kutir-Nahhunte I attacked Samsuiluna (c. 1749–c. 1712 BC), <span style='color: blue'><b>Hammurabi</b></span>’s son, and dealt so serious a defeat to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylonia</b></span> that the event was remembered more than <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>1,000 years</span> <span style='color: green'><b>1,000_Years</b></span> later in an inscription of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyrian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Assyria</b></span> king <span style='color: blue'><b>Ashurbanipal</b></span>. It may be assumed that with this <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>stroke</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Stroke</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Elam</b></span> once again gained independence. The end of the Eparti dynasty, which occurred possibly in the late 16th century BC, is buried in silence.
<br>
<br>After two centuries for which sources reveal nothing, the Middle <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Elamite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Elam</b></span> period opened with the rise to power of the Anzanite dynasty, whose homeland probably lay in the mountains northeast of modern Khūzestān. Political expansion under Khumbannumena (c. 1285–c. 1266 BC), the fourth king of this line, proceeded apace, and his successes were commemorated by his assumption of the title Expander of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span>. He was succeeded by his son, Untash-Gal (Untash [d] Gal, or Untash-Huban), a contemporary of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Shalmaneser I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Shalmaneser_I</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Assyria</b></span> (c. 1274–c. 1245 BC) and the founder of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of Dūr Untash (modern Choghā Zanbīl). In the years immediately following Untash-Gal’s reign, <span style='color: blue'><b>Elam</b></span> increasingly found itself in real or potential conflict with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>rising power</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Rising_Power</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Assyria</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tukulti-Ninurta I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tukulti-Ninurta_I</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Assyria</b></span> campaigned in the mountains north of <span style='color: blue'><b>Elam</b></span> in the latter part of the 13th century BC. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Elamites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Elam</b></span> under Kidin-Khutran, the second king after Untash-Gal, countered with a successful and devastating raid on <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylonia</b></span>. In the end, however, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyrian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Assyria</b></span> power seems to have been too great. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tukulti-Ninurta I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tukulti-Ninurta_I</b></span> managed to expand, for a brief time, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyrian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Assyria</b></span> control well to the south in <span style='color: blue'><b>Mesopotamia</b></span>. Kidin-Khutran faded into obscurity, and the Anzanite dynasty came to an end.
<br>
<br>After a short period of dynastic troubles, the second half of the Middle <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Elamite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Elam</b></span> period opened with the reign of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Shutruk-Nahhunte</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Shutruk-Nakhunte</b></span> I (c. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>1160 BC</span> <span style='color: green'><b>1160s_BC</b></span>). Two equally powerful and two rather less impressive kings followed this founder of a new dynasty, whose home was probably <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span>, and in this period <span style='color: blue'><b>Elam</b></span> became one of the great military powers of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Middle East</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Middle_East</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tukulti-Ninurta I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tukulti-Ninurta_I</b></span> died about 1208 BC, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Assyria</b></span> fell into a period of internal weakness and dynastic conflict. <span style='color: blue'><b>Elam</b></span> was quick to take advantage of this situation by campaigning extensively in the Diyālā River area and into the very heart of <span style='color: blue'><b>Mesopotamia</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Shutruk-Nahhunte</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Shutruk-Nakhunte</b></span> I captured <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span> and carried off to <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>stela</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Stele</b></span> on which was inscribed the famous law code of <span style='color: blue'><b>Hammurabi</b></span>. Shilkhak-In-Shushinak, brother and successor of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Shutruk-Nahhunte</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Shutruk-Nakhunte</b></span>’s eldest son, Kutir-Nahhunte I, still anxious to take advantage of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyrian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Assyria</b></span> weakness, campaigned as far north as the area of modern Kirkūk. In <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylonia</b></span>, however, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>2nd dynasty</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Second_Dynasty_of_Egypt</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Isin</b></span> led a native revolt against such control as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Elamites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Elam</b></span> had been able to exercise there, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Elamite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Elam</b></span> power in central <span style='color: blue'><b>Mesopotamia</b></span> was eventually broken. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Elamite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Elam</b></span> military empire began to shrink rapidly. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Nebuchadrezzar</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nebuchadnezzar_II</b></span> I of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Neo-Babylonian_Empire</b></span> (c. 1119–c. 1098 BC) attacked <span style='color: blue'><b>Elam</b></span> and was just barely thwarted. A second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Neo-Babylonian_Empire</b></span> attack succeeded, however, and the whole of <span style='color: blue'><b>Elam</b></span> was apparently overrun, ending the Middle <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Elamite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Elam</b></span> period.
<br>
<br>It is noteworthy that during the Middle <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Elamite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Elam</b></span> period the old system of succession to, and distribution of, power appears to have broken down. Increasingly, son succeeded father, and less is heard of divided authority within a federated system. This probably reflects an effort to increase the central authority at <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span> in order to conduct effective military campaigns abroad and to hold <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Elamite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Elam</b></span> foreign conquests. The old system of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>regionalism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dialect</b></span> balanced with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>federalism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Federalism</b></span> must have suffered, and the fraternal, sectional strife that so weakened <span style='color: blue'><b>Elam</b></span> in the Neo-Elamite period may have had its roots in the centrifugal developments of the 13th and 12th centuries BC.
<br>
<br>A long period of darkness separates the Middle and Neo-Elamite periods. In 742 BC a certain Huban-Nugash is mentioned as king in <span style='color: blue'><b>Elam</b></span>. The land appears to have been divided into separate principalities, with the central power fairly weak. During the next century the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Elamites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Elam</b></span> constantly attempted to interfere in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mesopotamian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mesopotamia</b></span> affairs, usually in alliance with <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span>, against the constant pressure of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Neo-Assyrian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Assyria</b></span> expansion. At times they were successful with this policy, both militarily and diplomatically, but on the whole they were forced to give way to increasing <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyrian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Assyria</b></span> power. Local <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Elamite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Elam</b></span> dynastic troubles were from time to time compounded by both <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyrian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Assyria</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylonia</b></span> interference. Meanwhile the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyrian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Assyria</b></span> army whittled away at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Elamite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Elam</b></span> power and influence in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Luristan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Luristan_bronze</b></span>. In time these internal and external pressures produced a near total collapse of any meaningful central authority in <span style='color: blue'><b>Elam</b></span>. In an effort to clean up a political and diplomatic mess that had become a chronic <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>headache</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Headache</b></span> for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyrians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Assyria</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Ashurbanipal</b></span>’s armies mounted a series of campaigns between 692 and 639 BC that utterly destroyed <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span>, pulling down buildings, looting, and sowing the land of <span style='color: blue'><b>Elam</b></span> with salt.
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>protohistoric</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Protohistory</b></span> period and the kingdom of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>
<br>The beginning of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iron Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Near_East</b></span> is marked by major dislocations of cultural and historical patterns in western <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span> (almost nothing is known of the eastern half of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Plateau</b></span> in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iron Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Near_East</b></span>). The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iron Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Near_East</b></span> itself is divided into three periods: <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iron Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Near_East</b></span> I (c. 1300–c. 1000 BC), <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iron Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Near_East</b></span> II (c. 1000–c. 800/750 BC), and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iron Age III</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iron_Age</b></span> (c. 750–c. 550 BC). The latter is the archaeological equivalent of what historically can be called the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Median_language</b></span> period.
<br>
<br>Though isolated groups of speakers of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Indo-European languages</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Indo-European_languages</b></span> had appeared and disappeared in western <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span> in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>2nd millennium BC</span> <span style='color: green'><b>2nd_millennium_BC</b></span>, it was during the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iron Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Near_East</b></span> that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Indo-European</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Indo-European_languages</b></span> Iranians rose to be the dominant force on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Plateau</b></span>. By the mid-9th century BC two major groups of Iranians appeared in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cuneiform</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cuneiform_script</b></span> sources: the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. Of the two the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span> were the more widespread and, from an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyrian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Neo-Assyrian_Empire</b></span> point of view, the more important group. When <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyrian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Neo-Assyrian_Empire</b></span> armies raided as far east as modern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hamadān</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hamadan</b></span>, they found only <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>. In the more western <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zagros</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zagros_Mountains</b></span> they encountered <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span> mixed with non-Iranian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>indigenous peoples</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Indigenous_peoples</b></span>. Early in the 1st millennium Iranian <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span> already controlled almost all of the eastern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zagros</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zagros_Mountains</b></span> and were infiltrating, if not actually pushing steadily into, the western <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zagros</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zagros_Mountains</b></span>, in some areas right up to the edge of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Plateau</b></span> and to the borders of lowland <span style='color: blue'><b>Mesopotamia</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persian_people</b></span> also appear in roughly the same areas, though their exact location remains controversial. At times they seem to have settled in the north near Lake <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Urmia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lake_Urmia</b></span>, at times in the central western <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zagros</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zagros_Mountains</b></span> near modern Kermānshāh, later certainly in the southwestern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zagros</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zagros_Mountains</b></span> somewhere near the borders of <span style='color: blue'><b>Elam</b></span>, and eventually, of course, in the region of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Fārs</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Fars_Province</b></span>. It has been argued that these various locations represent a nomadic tribe on the move; more likely they represent more than one group of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persian_people</b></span>. What is reasonably clear from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cuneiform</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cuneiform_script</b></span> sources is that these <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persian_people</b></span> (and no doubt other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iranian peoples</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iranian_peoples</b></span> not identified by name) were moving into western <span style='color: blue'><b>Iran</b></span> from the east. They probably followed routes along the southern face of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Elburz Mountains</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alborz</b></span> and, as they entered the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zagros</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zagros_Mountains</b></span>, spread out to the northwest and southeast following the natural topography of the mountains. Where they could, they infiltrated farther west—for example, along the major pass across the mountains from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hamadān</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hamadan</b></span> to Kermānshāh. In doing so, they met resistance from the local settled populations, who often appealed to <span style='color: blue'><b>Urartu</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Assyria</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Elam</b></span> for assistance in holding back the newcomers. Such appeals were, of course, most welcome to these great powers, who were willing to take advantage of the situation both to advance their interests at each other’s expense and to control the Iranian threat to themselves.
<br>
<br>It has been suggested that the introduction of gray and gray-black <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pottery</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pottery</b></span> into western <span style='color: blue'><b>Iran</b></span> from the northeast, which signals the start of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iron Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iron_Age</b></span>, is the archaeological manifestation of this pattern of a gradual movement of Iranians from east to west. The case is by no means proved, but it is a reasonable reading of the combined evidence. If it is so, then the earliest Iranians in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zagros Mountains</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zagros_Mountains</b></span> can be dated to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iron Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iron_Age</b></span> I times, about 1300 BC. Archaeologically, the culture of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iron Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iron_Age</b></span> II times can be seen as having evolved out of that of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iron Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iron_Age</b></span> I period, and, though the development is less clear, the same can be said of the relationship between the cultures of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iron Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iron_Age</b></span> II and III. The spread of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iron Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iron_Age</b></span> I and II cultures in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zagros</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zagros_Mountains</b></span> is restricted and would appear to correspond fairly well with the distribution of Iranians known from the written documents. The distribution of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iron Age III</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iron_Age</b></span> culture, on the other hand, is, at least by the 7th century BC, much more widespread and covers almost the whole of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zagros</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zagros_Mountains</b></span>. Thus, the argument that links these archaeological patterns with the Iranian migration into the area associates the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iron Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Near_East</b></span> I and II cultures with the early penetration of the Iranians into the more eastern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zagros</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zagros_Mountains</b></span> and with their infiltration westward along the major routes crosscutting the main <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mountain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mountain</b></span> alignments. Those areas where traces of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iron Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Near_East</b></span> I and II cultures do not appear were the regions still under the control of non-Iranian indigenous groups supported by <span style='color: blue'><b>Urartu</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Assyria</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Elam</b></span>. The widespread <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iron Age III</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iron_Age</b></span> culture is then associated with the rise to power of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> kingdom in the 7th and early 6th centuries BC and the Iranianization of the whole of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zagros Mountains</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zagros_Mountains</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Traditionally, the creator of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> kingdom was one <span style='color: blue'><b>Deioces</b></span>, who, according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, reigned from 728 to 675 BC and founded the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> capital <span style='color: blue'><b>Ecbatana</b></span> (modern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hamadān</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hamadan</b></span>). Attempts have been made to associate Dāiukku, a local <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zagros</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zagros_Mountains</b></span> king mentioned in a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cuneiform</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cuneiform_script</b></span> text as one of the captives deported to <span style='color: blue'><b>Assyria</b></span> by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sargon II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sargon_II</b></span> in 714 BC, with the <span style='color: blue'><b>Deioces</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, but such an association is highly unlikely. To judge from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyrian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Neo-Assyrian_Empire</b></span> sources, no <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> kingdom such as <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> describes for the reign of <span style='color: blue'><b>Deioces</b></span> existed in the early 7th century BC; at best, he is reporting a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> legend of the founding of their kingdom.
<br>
<br>According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Deioces</b></span> was succeeded by his son <span style='color: blue'><b>Phraortes</b></span> (reigned 675–653 BC), who subjugated the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persian_people</b></span> and lost his life in a premature attack against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyrians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Neo-Assyrian_Empire</b></span>. Some of this tale may be true. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyrian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Neo-Assyrian_Empire</b></span> texts speak of a <span style='color: blue'><b>Kashtariti</b></span> as the leader of a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>conglomerate</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chaebol</b></span> group of <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Scythians</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Mannaeans</b></span>, and miscellaneous other local <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zagros</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zagros_Mountains</b></span> peoples that seriously threatened the peace of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyria</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Neo-Assyrian_Empire</b></span>’s eastern borderlands during the reign of <span style='color: blue'><b>Esarhaddon</b></span> (680–669 BC). It is possible that <span style='color: blue'><b>Phraortes</b></span> is this <span style='color: blue'><b>Kashtariti</b></span>, though the suggestion cannot be proved either historically or linguistically. That a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> king in this period exerted political and military control over the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persian_people</b></span> is entirely reasonable, though it cannot be proved.
<br>
<br>Beginning as early as the 9th century BC and with increasing impact in the late 8th and early 7th centuries, groups of nomadic warriors entered western <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span>, probably from across the <span style='color: blue'><b>Caucasus</b></span>. Dominant among these groups were the <span style='color: blue'><b>Scythians</b></span>, and their entrance into the affairs of the western <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Plateau</b></span> during the 7th century may perhaps mark one of the turning points in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iron Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iron_Age</b></span> history. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> speaks in some detail of a period of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Scythian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Scythians</b></span> domination, the so-called <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Scythian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Scythians</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>interregnum</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Interregnum</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> dynasty history. His dating of this event remains uncertain, but traditionally it is seen as falling between the reigns of <span style='color: blue'><b>Phraortes</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyaxares</b></span> and covering the years 653 to 625 BC. Whether such an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>interregnum</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Interregnum</b></span> ever actually occurred and, if it did, whether it should not be dated later than this are open questions. What is clear is that by the mid 7th century BC there were a great many <span style='color: blue'><b>Scythians</b></span> in western <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span>, that they—along with the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span> and other groups—posed a serious threat to <span style='color: blue'><b>Assyria</b></span>, and that their appearance threw previous power alignments quite out of balance.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> reports how, under <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyaxares</b></span> of Media (625–585 BC), the <span style='color: blue'><b>Scythians</b></span> were overthrown when their kings were induced at a supper party to get so drunk that they were then easily slain. It is more likely that about this time either the <span style='color: blue'><b>Scythians</b></span> withdrew voluntarily from western <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span> and went off to plunder elsewhere or they were simply absorbed into a rapidly developing confederation under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hegemony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hegemony</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyaxares</b></span> is a fully historical figure who appears in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cuneiform</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cuneiform_script</b></span> sources as Uvakhshatra. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> speaks of how <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyaxares</b></span> reorganized the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> army into units built around specialized armaments: spearmen, archers, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>. The unified and reorganized <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span> were a match for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyrians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Assyria</b></span>. They attacked one of the important <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyrian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Assyria</b></span> border cities, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Arrapkha</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Arrapha</b></span>, in 615 BC, surrounded <span style='color: blue'><b>Nineveh</b></span> in 614 but were unable to capture it, and instead successfully stormed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyrian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Assyria</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>religious capital</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Religious_capital</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ashur</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Assur</b></span>. An alliance between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylonia</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span> was sealed by the betrothal of <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyaxares</b></span>’ granddaughter to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylonia</b></span> King <span style='color: blue'><b>Nabopolassar</b></span>’s son, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Nebuchadrezzar</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nebuchadnezzar_II</b></span> II (605–562 BC). In 612 the attack on <span style='color: blue'><b>Nineveh</b></span> was renewed, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> fell in late August (the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylonia</b></span> arrived rather too late to participate fully in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>). The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylonia</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span> together pursued the fleeing <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyrians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Assyria</b></span> westward into <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Syria</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Eber-Nari</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyrian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Assyria</b></span> appeals to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> for help came to naught, and the last <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyrian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Assyria</b></span> ruler, Ashur-uballiṭ II, disappeared from history in 609.
<br>
<br>The problem, of course, was how to divide the spoils among the victors. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cuneiform</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cuneiform_script</b></span> sources are comparatively <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>silent</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Silent_film</b></span>, but it would seem that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylonia</b></span> fell heir to all of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyrian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Assyria</b></span> holdings within the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Fertile Crescent</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Fertile_Crescent</b></span>, while their allies took over all of the highland areas. The <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span> gained control over the lands in eastern <span style='color: blue'><b>Anatolia</b></span> that had once been part of <span style='color: blue'><b>Urartu</b></span> and eventually became embroiled in war with the <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydians</b></span>, the dominant political power in western <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>. In 585 BC, probably through the mediation of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylonia</b></span>, peace was established between Media and <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span>, and the Halys (Kızıl) River was fixed as the boundary between the two kingdoms. Thus a new balance of power was established in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Middle East</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Middle_East</b></span> among <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydians</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylonia</b></span>, and, far to the south, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span>. At his death <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyaxares</b></span> controlled vast territories: all of <span style='color: blue'><b>Anatolia</b></span> to the Halys; the whole of western <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span> eastward, perhaps as far as the area of modern Tehrān; and all of southwestern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span>, including <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Fārs</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Fars_Province</b></span>. Whether it is appropriate to call these holdings a kingdom is debatable; one suspects that authority over the various peoples, Iranian and non-Iranian, who occupied these territories was exerted in the form of a confederation such as is implied by the ancient Iranian royal title, king of kings.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> followed his father, <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyaxares</b></span>, on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> throne (585–550 BC). Comparatively little is known of his reign. All was not well with the alliance with <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span>, and there is some evidence to suggest that <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylonia</b></span> may have feared <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> power. The latter, however, was soon in no position to threaten others, for <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> was himself under attack. Indeed, <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Medians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> were soon overthrown by the rise to power in the Iranian world of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> (the Great) of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The ruling dynasty of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> that was settled in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Fārs</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Fars_Province</b></span> in southwestern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span> (possibly the Parsumash of the later <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyrian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Assyria</b></span> records) traced its ancestry back to an eponymous ancestor, Hāxamanish, or <span style='color: blue'><b>Achaemenes</b></span>. There is no historical evidence of such a king’s existence. Traditionally, three rulers fell between <span style='color: blue'><b>Achaemenes</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>: <span style='color: blue'><b>Teispes</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_I</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Teispes</b></span>, freed of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> domination during the so-called <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Scythian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Scythians</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>interregnum</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Interregnum</b></span>, is thought to have expanded his kingdom and to have divided it on his death between his two sons, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Ariaramnes</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> may have been the king of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> who appears in the records of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ashurbanipal</b></span> swearing allegiance to <span style='color: blue'><b>Assyria</b></span> after the devastation of <span style='color: blue'><b>Elam</b></span> in the campaigns of 642–639 BC, though there are chronological problems involved with this equation. When <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> control over the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> was supposedly reasserted under <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyaxares</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_I</b></span> is thought to have been given a reunited <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> to administer as a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vassal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vassal</b></span>. His son, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>, married the daughter of <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> and in 559 inherited his father’s position within the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> confederation.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> certainly warranted his later title, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> the Great. He must have been a remarkable personality, and certainly he was a remarkable king. He united under his authority several <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> and Iranian groups who apparently had not been under his father’s control. He then initiated diplomatic exchanges with <span style='color: blue'><b>Nabonidus</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span> (556–539 BC), which justifiably worried <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>. Eventually he openly rebelled against the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>, who were beaten in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> when considerable numbers of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> troops deserted to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> standard. Thus in 550 the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> became the first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> empire, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> kings appeared on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>international</span> <span style='color: green'><b>International_law</b></span> scene with a suddenness that must have frightened many.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> immediately set out to expand his conquests. After apparently convincing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylonia</b></span> that they had nothing to fear from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, he turned against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> under the rule of the fabulously wealthy <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> appeals to <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span> were to no <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>avail</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Avail</b></span>. He then took <span style='color: blue'><b>Cilicia</b></span>, thus cutting the routes over which any help might have reached the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span> attacked, and an indecisive <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> was fought in 547 BC on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Halys River</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kızılırmak_River</b></span>. Since it was late in the campaigning season, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> thought the war was over for that year, returned to their capital at <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>, and dispersed the national levy. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>, however, kept coming. He caught and besieged the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>citadel</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Citadel</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> and captured <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span> in 546. Of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states along the western coast of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>, heretofore under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> control, only <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> surrendered without a fight. The others were systematically reduced by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> armies led by subordinate generals. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> himself was apparently busy elsewhere, possibly in the east, for little is known of his activities between the capture of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> and the beginning of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Neo-Babylonian_Empire</b></span> campaign in 540.
<br>
<br>Nowhere did <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> display his political and military genius better than in the conquest of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Neo-Babylonian_Empire</b></span>. The campaign actually began when he lulled the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Neo-Babylonian_Empire</b></span> into inactivity during his war with <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span>, which, since it was carried to a successful conclusion, deprived the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Neo-Babylonian_Empire</b></span> of a potential ally when their turn came. Then he took full advantage of internal disaffection and discontent within <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Neo-Babylonian_Empire</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Nabonidus</b></span> was not a popular king: he had paid too little attention to home affairs and had alienated the native <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Neo-Babylonian_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>priesthood</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Priest</b></span>. The writer of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Deutero-Isaiah</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Book_of_Isaiah</b></span>, speaking for many of the captive <span style='color: blue'><b>Jews</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Neo-Babylonian_Empire</b></span>, undoubtedly represented the hopes of many of <span style='color: blue'><b>Nabonidus</b></span>’s subjects that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> was a potential deliverer. With the stage thus set, the military campaign against <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span> came almost as an anticlimax. The fall of the greatest <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Middle East</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Middle_East</b></span> was swift; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> marched into town in the late summer of 539 BC, seized the hands of the statue of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city god</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tutelary_deity</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Marduk</b></span> as a signal of his willingness to rule as a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylon</b></span> and not as a foreign conqueror, and was hailed by many as the legitimate successor to the throne. In one stride <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> carried <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> power to the borders of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span>, for with <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span> came all that it had seized from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyrians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Assyria</b></span> and gained in the sequel.
<br>
<br>Little is known of the remainder of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>’s reign. The rapidity with which his son and successor, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span>, initiated a successful campaign against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> suggests that preparations for such an attack were well advanced under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>. But the founder of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> power was forced to turn east late in his reign to protect that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>frontier</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Frontier</b></span> against warlike tribes who were themselves in part Iranians and who threatened the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Plateau</b></span> in the same manner as had the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> more than a millennium earlier. One of the recurrent themes of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iranian history</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span> is the threat of peoples from the east. How much <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> conquered in the east is uncertain. What is clear is that he lost his life in 529 BC, fighting somewhere in the region of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Oxus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Amu_Darya</b></span> (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Amu Darya</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Amu_Darya</b></span>) and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Jaxartes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Syr_Darya</b></span> (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Syr Darya</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Syr_Darya</b></span>) rivers.
<br>
<br>On the death of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> the Great, the empire passed to his son, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span> (reigned 529–522 BC). There may have been some degree of unrest throughout the empire at the time of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>’s death, for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span> apparently felt it necessary to secretly kill his brother, <span style='color: blue'><b>Bardiya</b></span> (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Smerdis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bardiya</b></span>), in order to protect his rear while leading the campaign against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> in 525. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pharaoh</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pharaoh</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ahmose II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Amasis_II</b></span> of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>26th dynasty</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Twenty-sixth_Dynasty_of_Egypt</b></span> sought to shore up his defenses by hiring <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_language</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mercenaries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mercenary</b></span> but was betrayed by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span> successfully managed to cross the hostile <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sinai Desert</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sinai_Peninsula</b></span>, traditionally <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span>’s first and strongest line of defense, and brought the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Psamtik III</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Psamtik_III</b></span>, son and successor of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ahmose II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Amasis_II</b></span>, to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Pelusium</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> lost and retired to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Memphis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Memphis_Tigers_men's_basketball</b></span>, which subsequently fell to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. Three subsidiary campaigns were then mounted, all of which are reported as failures: one against <span style='color: blue'><b>Carthage</b></span>, though the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenician</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span> sailors, who were the backbone of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> navy, declined to sail against their own <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>colony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Colonies_in_antiquity</b></span>; one against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oasis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Oasis</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Amon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Amun</b></span> (in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> desert west of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Nile</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nile_Delta</b></span>), which, according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, was defeated by a massive <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sandstorm</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dust_storm</b></span>; and one led by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span> himself to <span style='color: blue'><b>Nubia</b></span>. This latter effort was partly successful, but the army suffered badly from a lack of proper provisions on the return march. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</b></span> was then garrisoned at three major points: Daphnae in the east delta, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Memphis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Memphis_Tigers_men's_basketball</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Elephantine</b></span>, where <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Jewish</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Jews</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mercenaries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mercenary</b></span> formed the main body of troops.
<br>
<br>In 522 BC news reached <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span> of a revolt in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span> led by an impostor claiming to be <span style='color: blue'><b>Bardiya</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span>’ brother. Several provinces of the empire accepted the new ruler, who bribed his subjects by remitting taxes for three years. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span> died—possibly by his own hand but more probably from infection following an accidental <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sword</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sword</b></span> wound—as he hastened home to regain control. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>, a leading general in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span>’ army and one of the princes of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> family, raced homeward with the troops in order to crush the rebellion in a manner profitable to himself.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span> has been rather <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mistreated</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mistreated_(song)</b></span> in the sources, partly because of the prejudices of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>’s <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> informers and partly because of the propagandist motives of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span> is reported to have ruled the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> harshly and to have desecrated their religious ceremonies and shrines. His military campaigns out of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> were all reported as failures. He was accused of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>suicide</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Suicide</b></span> in the face of revolt at home. It was even suggested that he was mad. There is, however, little solid contemporary evidence to support these charges.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>, called the Great, tells in detail the story of the overthrow of the false <span style='color: blue'><b>Bardiya</b></span> and of the first year of his own rule in his famous royal inscription cut on a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>rock</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Rock_music</b></span> face at the base of Mount Bīsotūn, a few miles east of modern Kermānshāh. Some historians consider <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>’s account to be mere <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>propaganda</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Propaganda</b></span> and argue instead that <span style='color: blue'><b>Bardiya</b></span> was not an imposter. According to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>, six leading <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> nobles assisted in slaying the imposter and together proclaimed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>rightful heir</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Rightful_Heir</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> was a member of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> royal house. His great-grandfather was <span style='color: blue'><b>Ariaramnes</b></span>, son of <span style='color: blue'><b>Teispes</b></span>, who had shared power in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> with his brother <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Ariaramnes</b></span>’ son, <span style='color: blue'><b>Arsames</b></span>, and his grandson, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hystaspes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vishtaspa</b></span> (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>’s father), had not been kings in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, as unified royal power had been placed in the hands of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_I</b></span> by <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyaxares</b></span>. Neither is named a king in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>’s own inscriptions. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hystaspes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vishtaspa</b></span> was, however, an important royal prince and apparently the governor of Persis. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> himself was in the mold of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great—a powerful personality and a dynamic ruler.
<br>
<br>It took more than a year (522–521 BC) of hard fighting to put down the revolts associated with <span style='color: blue'><b>Bardiya</b></span>’s claim to the throne and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>’s succession to power. Almost every province of the empire was involved in the conflict, including <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> and, most particularly, Media. A balanced policy of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>clemency</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pardon</b></span> backed by the swift and thorough punishment of any captured rebel leader, in combination with a well-coordinated and carefully timed distribution of loyal forces, eventually brought peace to the empire and undisputed power to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>. He then turned his attention to the organization and consolidation of his inheritance, and it was for this role—that of lawgiver and organizer—that he himself, to judge from his inscriptions, most wished to be remembered.
<br>
<br>Such activities, however, did not prevent <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> from following an active expansionist policy. Campaigns to the east confirmed gains probably made by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great and added large sections of the northern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Indian subcontinent</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Indian_subcontinent</b></span> to the list of Persian-controlled provinces. Expansion in the west began about <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>516 BC</span> <span style='color: green'><b>516_BC</b></span> when <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> moved against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> as a first step toward an attack on the <span style='color: blue'><b>Scythians</b></span> along the western and northern shores of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Black</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Black_Sea</b></span>. The real strategic purpose behind this move probably was to disrupt and, if possible, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>interrupt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Interrupt</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> trade with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Black</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Black_Sea</b></span> area, which supplied much grain to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. Crossing into <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span> for the first time, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> campaigned with comparatively little success to the north of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Danube River</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Danube</b></span>. He retreated in good order, however, with only limited losses, and a bridgehead across the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> was established.

<br>Perhaps partly in response to these developments or perhaps for more purely internal reasons, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities on the west coast of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> revolted against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule in 500 BC. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> were apparently taken by surprise, and at first the rebellion prospered. The <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> received some limited assistance from the Athenians and in 498 felt strong enough to make another offensive. With one hand <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> negotiated; with the other he assembled a counterattack. The first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> military efforts proved only partially successful, however, and the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> enjoyed another respite in the years 496–495. A renewed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> offensive in 494 was successful. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet was badly beaten off <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> land army began a systematic reduction of the rebel cities. About 492 <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>, a son-in-law of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>, was made special commissioner to <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>. He suppressed local tyrants and returned democratic government to many cities. In time the wounds caused by the revolt and its suppression healed, and by 481 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> was able to levy troops in this region with little trouble.
<br>
<br>By 492 BC <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> had also recovered <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedonia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Republic_of_Macedonia</b></span>, first gained in the campaign against the <span style='color: blue'><b>Scythians</b></span> and lost during the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>. There followed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> that led to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>’s defeat at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> late in the summer of 490 BC. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The great king</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Great_King</b></span> was forced to retreat and to face the fact that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> problem, which had probably seemed to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> a minor issue on the western extremity of the empire, would require a more concerted and massive effort. Thus began preparations for an invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> on a grand, coordinated scale. These plans were interrupted in 486 by two events: a serious revolt in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</b></span>, and the death of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> (reigned 486–465 BC), <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>’s eldest son by Queen <span style='color: blue'><b>Atossa</b></span>, was born after his father had come to the throne; he had been designated official heir perhaps as early as 498, and while <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>crown prince</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Crown_prince</b></span> he had ruled as the king’s governor in <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span>. The new king quickly suppressed the revolt in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</b></span> in a single campaign in 484. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> then broke with the policy followed by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> of ruling foreign lands with a fairly light hand, and, in a manner compatible with local traditions, he ruthlessly ignored <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> forms of rule and imposed his will on the rebellious province in a thoroughly <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> style. Plans for the invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> begun under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> were then still further delayed by a major revolt in <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylonia</b></span> about 482 BC, which also was suppressed with a heavy hand.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> then turned his attention westward to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. He wintered in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> in 481–480 and thence led a combined land and sea invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Northern Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Northern_Greece</b></span> fell to the invaders in the summer of 480, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> stand at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span> in August of 480 came to naught, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> land forces marched on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, taking and burning the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Acropolis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Acropolis_of_Athens</b></span>. But the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet lost the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>, and the impetus of the invasion was blunted. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>, who had by then been away from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> rather long for a king with such widespread responsibilities, returned home and left <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> in charge of further operations. The real end of the invasion came with the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Plataea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Plataea</b></span>, the fall of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia</b></span> (a stronghold of pro-Persian forces), and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> naval loss at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span> in 479. Of the three, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> loss at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Plataea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Plataea</b></span> was perhaps the most decisive. Up until <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> was killed, the issue of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> was probably still in doubt, but, once leaderless, the less organized and less disciplined <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> forces collapsed. <span style='color: blue'><b>Time</b></span> and again in later years this was to be the pattern in such encounters, for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> never solved the military problem posed by the disciplined <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The formation of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>, the rise of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>imperialism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Imperialism</b></span>, troubles on the west coast of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>, and the end of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> military ambitions in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> followed rapidly in the decade after <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Plataea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Plataea</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> probably lost interest in the proceedings and sank deeper and deeper into the comforts of life in his capital cities of <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Ecbatana</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Persepolis</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Harem</b></span> intrigues, which were steadily to sap the strength and vitality of the Achaemenian <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span>, led to the king’s assassination in 465 BC.
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia</b></span> to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius III</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_III</b></span>
<br>The death of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> was a major turning point in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> history. Occasional flashes of vigour and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>intelligence</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Intelligence</b></span> by some of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>’ successors were too infrequent to prevent eventual collapse but did allow the empire to die gradually. It is a tribute to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_I</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius III</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_III</b></span> that the empire they constructed was as resilient as it proved to be after <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The three kings that followed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> on the throne—Artaxerxes I (reigned 465–425 BC), <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_II_of_Persia</b></span> (425–424), and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius II Ochus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_II</b></span> (423–404)—were all comparatively weak as individuals and as kings, and such successes as the empire enjoyed during their reigns were mainly the result of the efforts of subordinates or of the troubles faced by their adversaries. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia</b></span> faced several rebellions, the most important of which was that of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_ancient_Egypt</b></span> in 459, not fully suppressed until 454. An <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>advantageous</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Advantageous</b></span> peace (the Peace of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Callias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Callias_II</b></span>) with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> was signed in 448 BC, whereby the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> agreed to stay out of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> and the Athenians agreed to leave <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenids</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> broke the peace in 439 in an attack on <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span>, and in its aftermath the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> made some military gains in the west. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_II_of_Persia</b></span> ruled only about <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>45 days</span> <span style='color: green'><b>45_Days</b></span> and was killed while in a drunken stupor by the son of one of his father’s concubines. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The assassin</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Jody_Hamilton</b></span> was himself killed by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_II</b></span>, who rose to the throne through palace intrigue. Several revolts marred his reign, including one in Media, which was rather close to home.
<br>
<br>The major event of these three reigns was the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> between <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, which was fought, with occasional pauses, over the latter decades of the 5th century BC. The situation was ripe for exploitation by the famous <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> archers, the gold coins of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenids</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> that depicted an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>archer</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archery</b></span> on their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>obverse</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Obverse_and_reverse</b></span> and that were used with considerable skill by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> in bribing first one <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> state and then another. Initially the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> encouraged <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> against <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> and from this gained the Peace of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Callias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Callias_II</b></span>. Then, after the disastrous <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> campaign against <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicily</b></span> in 413, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> intervened on <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>’s side. By the treaty of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> in 412, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> recovered complete freedom in western <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> in return for agreeing to pay for seamen to man the Peloponnesian fleet. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> gold and Spartan soldiers brought about the fall of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> in 404 BC. Despite the fact that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> played the two sides against each other to their own advantage, they should have done better. One observes a certain lack of control from <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span> by the king in these proceedings, and the two principal governors in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> who were involved, <span style='color: blue'><b>Tissaphernes</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pharnabazus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pharnabazus_II</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespontine Phrygia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hellespontine_Phrygia</b></span>, seemed to have permitted a personal power rivalry to stand in the way of a really coordinated <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> intervention in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> war. When <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</b></span> revolted in 405 BC, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> was unable to do much about it, and from that point forward <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</b></span> remained essentially an independent state.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia</b></span> came to the throne in 404 and reigned until 359 BC. The main events of his long rule were the war with <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> that ended with a peace favourable to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>; the revolt and loss to the empire of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</b></span>; the rebellion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Younger, brother of the king; and the uprising known as the revolt of the satraps.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, triumphant over <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, built a small empire of its own and was soon involved in a war against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, the principal issue again being the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>. While <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> played one <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> governor in <span style='color: blue'><b>Anatolia</b></span> against the other, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> spent gold in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> to raise rebellion on <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>’s home ground. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> rebuilt their fleet and placed a competent <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>admiral</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Admiral</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Conon</b></span>, in command. The contest continued from 400 to 387, with <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> forced to act on an ever-shrinking front. A revitalized <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, supported by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, created a balance of power in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, and eventually <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia</b></span> was able to step in, at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>’ request, and dictate the so-called King’s Peace of 387–386 BC. Once again the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> gave up any claim to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> and further agreed to maintain the status <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>quo</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Quo_(Status_Quo_album)</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> itself.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Younger, though caught in an assassination attempt at the time of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia</b></span>’ coronation, was nevertheless forgiven and was returned to the command of a province in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>. But he revolted again in 401 BC and, supported by 10,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mercenaries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mercenary</b></span>, marched eastward to contest the throne. He was defeated and killed at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cunaxa</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Cunaxa</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Mesopotamia</b></span> that summer. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mercenaries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mercenary</b></span>, however, were not broken and, though harried, left the field in good order and began their famous march, recorded in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Anabasis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Anabasis_of_Alexander</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Xenophon</b></span>, north to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Black</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Black_Sea</b></span> and home. Probably no other event in late <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> history revealed more clearly to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> the essential internal weakness of the Achaemenian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> than the escape of so large a body of men from the very heart of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> domain.
<br>
<br>Since 379 BC <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia</b></span> had been gathering <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mercenaries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mercenary</b></span> in order to mount a campaign against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_ancient_Egypt</b></span>. An attack in 373 failed against the native <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>30th dynasty</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thirtieth_Dynasty_of_Egypt</b></span>. On the heels of this failure came the revolt of the satraps, or provincial governors. Several satraps rose against the central power, and one, Aroandas (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Orontes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Orontes_I</b></span>), a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Armenia</b></span>, went so far as to stamp his own gold coinage as a direct challenge to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia</b></span>. The general plan of the rebels appears to have been for a combined attack. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The rebel</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Rebel_Media</b></span> satraps were to coordinate their march eastward through <span style='color: blue'><b>Syria</b></span> with an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> attack, under the king <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tachos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Teos_of_Egypt</b></span>, and support by Greek <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mercenaries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mercenary</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> attack was called off because of a revolt in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</b></span> by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tachos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Teos_of_Egypt</b></span>’s brother, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia</b></span> managed to defeat the satraps who were left alone to face the king’s wrath. Several of the satraps, including Aroandas, were actually forgiven and returned to their governorships. In general the impression is that, in the end, rather than fight the central authority, the satraps were willing to return to their own provinces and plunder there in the name of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia</b></span>. Perhaps they saw that they actually had more authority and more control over real events in their own provincial territories than <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia</b></span> had in his empire.

<br>Plot and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>counterplot</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Counterplot</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>harem</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Harem</b></span> intrigue, and murder brought <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes III</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_III</b></span> to the throne in 359 BC. He promptly exterminated many of his relatives who might have challenged his rule—all to no <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>avail</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Avail</b></span>, for revolts continued to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>rock</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Rock_music</b></span> the empire. A fresh attempt to win back <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_ancient_Egypt</b></span> was repulsed in 351. This setback encouraged revolt in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sidon</b></span> and eventually in all of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Palestine</span> <span style='color: green'><b>State_of_Palestine</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Phoenicia</b></span>. Parts of <span style='color: blue'><b>Cilicia</b></span> joined the rebellion, but the revolt there was crushed in 345, the same year it had begun. Peace was achieved only temporarily; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mercenaries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mercenary</b></span> from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Argives</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Argos</b></span>, as well as from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>, gathered for a new attempt on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_ancient_Egypt</b></span>. Led by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes III</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_III</b></span> himself, it succeeded in 343 BC. But the local <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> dynasty fled south to <span style='color: blue'><b>Nubia</b></span>, where it maintained an independent kingdom that kept alive the hopes of a dynastic revival. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> then misplayed its hand in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> by refusing aid to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>rising power</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Rising_Power</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Philip II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Philip_II_of_Macedon</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span>. In 339 BC <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> troops were fighting alone in <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span> against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Macedonians</b></span>, and in the following year, at the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Chaeronea</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Philip II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Philip_II_of_Macedon</b></span> extended his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hegemony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Theban_hegemony</b></span> over all of Greece—a united <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> that was to prove impervious to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> gold.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes III</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_III</b></span> was poisoned by his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>physician</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Physician</b></span> at the order of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>eunuch</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Eunuch</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Bagoas</b></span>. The latter made <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes III</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_III</b></span>’ youngest son, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Arses</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Arses_of_Persia</b></span>, king (338–336 BC) in hopes of being the power behind the throne, but <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Arses</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Arses_of_Persia</b></span> did not bend easily to <span style='color: blue'><b>Bagoas</b></span>’s will. He attempted to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>poison</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Poison</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>kingmaker</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kingmaker</b></span> but was himself killed in retaliation. <span style='color: blue'><b>Bagoas</b></span> then engineered the accession of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius III</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_III</b></span>, a 45-year-old former <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Armenia</b></span>. So many members of the royal house had been murdered in the court intrigue that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius III</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_III</b></span> probably held the closest <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>blood</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Blood</b></span> claim to the throne by virtue of being the grandnephew of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius III</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_III</b></span> was able to put down yet another rebellion in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</b></span> under Khababash in 337–336 BC, but the beginning of the end of the Achaemenian <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span> came soon afterward, in May 334, when he lost the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Granicus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_the_Granicus</b></span> to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Persepolis</b></span> fell to the invader in April 330, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius III</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_III</b></span>, the last <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, was murdered in the summer of the same year while fleeing the conqueror. His unfinished tomb at <span style='color: blue'><b>Persepolis</b></span> bears witness to his lack of preparation.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> did not win his victories easily, however, and the catalog of troubles that marked the latter part of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> Empire—rebellions, murders, weak kings trapped in the harems, missed chances, and foolish policies—cannot be the whole story. The sources, mostly <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_language</b></span>, are often prejudiced against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> and tend to view events from but a single point of view. No government could have lasted so long, found its way somehow through so many difficulties, and in the end actually have fought so hard against the conqueror without having much virtue with which to balance its vices.
<br>
<br>The culture that developed under the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenids</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> was in reality the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>collective societies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Copyright_collective</b></span> and cultures of the many subject peoples of the empire. From this <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mosaic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mosaic</b></span> it is sometimes difficult to sort out that which is distinctively <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> or distinctively a development of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> period and therefore perhaps an early Iranian contribution to general Middle Eastern society and culture.
<br>
<br>The languages of the empire were as varied as its peoples. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span>, at least originally, spoke <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Old Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Old_Persian</b></span>, a southwestern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dialect</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dialect</b></span> of Iranian (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> was a northwestern Iranian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dialect</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dialect</b></span>), and were a nonliterate society. Their language was first written when <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius III</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_III</b></span> commanded that a script suitable for this purpose be invented so that he might inscribe the record of his rise to power at Bīsotūn (the inscriptions in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Old Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Old_Persian</b></span> attributed to earlier kings were likely written during the reign of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius III</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_III</b></span> or are later historical forgeries). That few could read <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Old Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Old_Persian</b></span> might be the reason why <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius III</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_III</b></span> at Bīsotūn established the tradition that royal inscriptions should be trilingual in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Old Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Old_Persian</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Akkadian_language</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Elamite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Elamite_language</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Old Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Old_Persian</b></span> was never a working written language of the empire. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Elamite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Elamite_language</b></span>, written on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>clay</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Clay_tablet</b></span> tablets, appears to have been the language of many of the administrators in Persis and, it may be assumed, in <span style='color: blue'><b>Elam</b></span>. Archives of administrative documents in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Elamite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Elamite_language</b></span> have been found at <span style='color: blue'><b>Persepolis</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aramaic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Old_Aramaic_language</b></span>, however, was the language of much of the empire and was probably the language most used in the imperial bureaucracy. The beginnings of the strong influence of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aramaic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Old_Aramaic_language</b></span> on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, which is so evident in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Middle Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Middle_Persian</b></span> of Sāsānian times, can already be seen in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Old Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Old_Persian</b></span> royal inscriptions of late <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> times. (See also <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iranian languages</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iranian_languages</b></span>.)
<br>
<br>Little is known of Iranian social organization in the period. In general, it was based on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>feudal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Feudalism</b></span> lines that were drawn in part by economic and social functions. Traditional <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Indo-Iranian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Indo-Iranians</b></span> society consisted of three classes: the warriors or aristocracy, the priests, and the farmers or herdsmen. Crosscutting these divisions was a tribal structure based on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>patrilineal descent</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Patrilineality</b></span>. The title king of kings, used even in the 20th century by the shahs of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span>, implies that the central authority exercised power through a pyramidal structure that was controlled at levels below the supreme authority by individuals who were themselves, in a certain sense, kings. Traditionally, the king was elected from a particular family by the warrior class; he was sacred, and a certain royal charisma attached to his person.
<br>
<br>Such a method of organizing and controlling society undoubtedly changed under the influences and demands of imperial power and underwent much modification as Iranians increasingly borrowed social and political ideas from the peoples they ruled. Even in later times, nevertheless, there is evidence that the original Iranian concepts of kingship and social organization were still honoured and remained the ideals of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian culture</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Culture_of_Iran</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Iranian religion in the pre-Achaemenian and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> periods is a subject on which there is little scholarly agreement. When the Iranians first entered the dim light of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>protohistoric</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Protohistory</b></span> period, they were certainly <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>polytheists</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Polytheism</b></span> whose religious beliefs and practices closely paralleled other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Indo-Iranian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Indo-Iranians</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Indo-European</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Proto-Indo-European_religion</b></span> groups at the same stage in history. Their gods were associated with natural phenomena, with social, military, and economic functions, and with abstract concepts such as justice and truth. Their religious practices included, among others, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>animal sacrifice</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Animal_sacrifice</b></span>, a reverence for fire, and the drinking of the juice of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>haoma</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Haoma</b></span> plant, a natural intoxicant.
<br>
<br>Probably about 600 BC there arose in the northeast of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Plateau</b></span> the great Iranian religious <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>prophet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Prophet</b></span> and teacher <span style='color: blue'><b>Zoroaster</b></span> (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zarathushtra</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zoroaster</b></span>). The history of the religion that he founded is even more complicated and controversial than the history of pre-Zoroastrian Iranian religion. Yet certain features of his religious reform stand out. He was an ethical <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>prophet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Prophet</b></span> of the highest rank, stressing constantly the need to act righteously and to speak the truth and abhor the lie. In his teaching, the lie was almost personified as the <span style='color: blue'><b>Druj</b></span>, chief in the kingdom of the demons, to which he relegated many of the earlier <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Indo-Iranian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Indo-Iranians</b></span> deities. His god was <span style='color: blue'><b>Ahura</b></span> Mazdā, who, it seems likely, was a creation, in name and attributes, of <span style='color: blue'><b>Zoroaster</b></span>. Though in a certain sense technically <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>monotheistic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Monotheism</b></span>, early <span style='color: blue'><b>Zoroastrianism</b></span> viewed the world in strongly <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dualistic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dualism</b></span> terms, for <span style='color: blue'><b>Ahura</b></span> Mazdā and the Lie were deeply involved in a struggle for the human <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>soul</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Soul</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Zoroaster</b></span>, as might be expected, attempted to reform earlier Iranian religious practices and beliefs. He first rejected and then perhaps allowed in a modified form the practice of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>haoma</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Haoma</b></span> cult, clearly condemned the practice of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>animal sacrifice</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Animal_sacrifice</b></span>, and elevated to central importance in the ritual a reverence for fire. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Fire worship</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Fire_worship</b></span>, however, is a misnomer, because the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zoroastrians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zoroastrianism</b></span> have never worshiped fire but rather have revered it as the symbol par excellence of truth.
<br>
<br>The crucial question is: Were the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenids</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zoroastrians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zoroastrianism</b></span> or at least followers of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>prophet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Prophet</b></span> in the terms in which they understood his message? Possibly <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great was, probably <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> was, and almost certainly <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> and his successors were. Such a simple answer to the question is possible, however, only if it is understood that <span style='color: blue'><b>Zoroastrianism</b></span> as a religion had already undergone considerable development and modification since <span style='color: blue'><b>Zoroaster</b></span>’s lifetime, influenced by the beliefs and practices and by the religions of those people of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Middle East</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Middle_East</b></span> with whom the expanding Iranians had <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>intimate contact</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Intimate_Contact</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The god of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> kings was the great <span style='color: blue'><b>Ahura</b></span> Mazdā, from whom they understood they had received their empire and with whose aid they accomplished all deeds. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> and his successors mention other deities by name, but <span style='color: blue'><b>Ahura</b></span> Mazdā remains supreme. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> names only <span style='color: blue'><b>Ahura</b></span> Mazdā in his inscriptions. More significant, however, is <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>’s tone, which is entirely compatible with the moral tone of <span style='color: blue'><b>Zoroaster</b></span> and, in some instances, even compatible with details of <span style='color: blue'><b>Zoroaster</b></span>’s <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>theology</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Christian_theology</b></span>. During the reigns of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>, the archaeological record reveals that religious rituals were in force that were also compatible with an evolved and evolving <span style='color: blue'><b>Zoroastrianism</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>haoma</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Haoma</b></span> cult was practiced at <span style='color: blue'><b>Persepolis</b></span>, but <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>animal sacrifice</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Animal_sacrifice</b></span> is not attested. More important, fire clearly played a central role in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> religion.
<br>
<br>There may have been religious overtones in the quarrel between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_I</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> on the one hand and the false Bardiya—a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>magus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Magi</b></span>, or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> priest—on the other. Certainly there were religious as well as political motivations behind <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>’ suppression of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>daeva</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Daeva</b></span> (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>deva</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Deva_(Hinduism)</b></span>) worshipers and the destruction of their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Egyptian_temple</b></span>. It is possible that there was some conflict among the royal <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenids</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, who were followers of one form of <span style='color: blue'><b>Zoroastrianism</b></span>, the supporters of a different version of <span style='color: blue'><b>Zoroastrianism</b></span> as practiced by other Iranians, believers in older forms of Iranian religion, and believers in foreign religions, which in the light of <span style='color: blue'><b>Zoroaster</b></span>’s teachings were reprehensible. Compromises and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>syncretism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Syncretism</b></span>, however, probably could not be prevented. Though the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zoroastrian calendar</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zoroastrian_calendar</b></span> was adopted as the official calendar of the empire in the reign of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia</b></span>, by the time of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia</b></span> the ancient Iranian god <span style='color: blue'><b>Mithra</b></span> and the goddess <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Anāhitā</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anahita</b></span> (Anahīti) had been accepted in the royal religion alongside <span style='color: blue'><b>Ahura</b></span> Mazdā.
<br>
<br>Thus, in a sense, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> kings were <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zoroastrians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zoroastrianism</b></span>, but <span style='color: blue'><b>Zoroastrianism</b></span> itself was probably no longer exactly the religion <span style='color: blue'><b>Zoroaster</b></span> had attempted to establish. What the religion of the people beyond court circles may have been is almost impossible to say. One suspects that a variety of ancient Iranian cults and beliefs were prevalent. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>magi</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Magi</b></span>, the traditional priests of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>, may have wielded more influence in the countryside than they did at court, and popular beliefs and practices may have been more deeply influenced by contact with other peoples and other religions. Later <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>classical</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_antiquity</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Zoroastrianism</b></span>, as known in the Sāsānian period, was an amalgam of such popular cults, of the religion of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> court, and of the teachings of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>prophet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Prophet</b></span> in their purer form. (See also <span style='color: blue'><b>Zoroastrianism</b></span>.)

<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> art, like <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> religion, was a blend of many elements.

The stone-cutters who wrought the stone, those were <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> and Sardians.

<br>
<br>This was an imperial art on a scale the world had not seen before. Materials and artists were drawn from all the lands ruled by the great king, and thus tastes, styles, and motifs became mixed together in an eclectic art and architecture that in itself mirrored the empire and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>’ understanding of how that empire ought to function. Yet the whole was entirely <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. Just as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenids</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were tolerant in matters of local government and custom as long as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> controlled the general policy and administration of the empire, so also were they tolerant in art so long as the finished and total effect was <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. At <span style='color: blue'><b>Pasargadae</b></span>, the capital of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_I</b></span> in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> homeland (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Fārs</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Fars_Province</b></span>), and at <span style='color: blue'><b>Persepolis</b></span>, the neighbouring <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> founded by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> the Great and used by all his successors, one can trace to a foreign origin almost all the details in the construction and embellishment of the architecture and the sculptured reliefs, but the conception, planning, and overall finished product are distinctly <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> and could not have been created by any of the foreign groups who supplied the king of kings with artistic talent. This was true also of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>decorative arts</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Decorative_arts</b></span>, at which the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> excelled: fine <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>metal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Metalworking</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tableware</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tableware</b></span>, jewelry, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>seal cutting</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Seal_carving</b></span>, weaponry and its decoration, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pottery</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pottery</b></span>.
<br>
<br>It has been suggested that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> called on the subject peoples for artists because they were themselves crude barbarians with little taste and needed quickly to create an imperial art to match their sudden rise to political power. Yet excavations at sites from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>protohistoric</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Protohistory</b></span> period show this not to have been the case. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> may have been the leader of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> tribes not yet as sophisticated nor as civilized as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylonia</b></span> or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span>, but, when he chose to build <span style='color: blue'><b>Pasargadae</b></span>, he had a long artistic tradition behind him that was probably already distinctly Iranian and that was in many ways the equal of any. To show this, two examples suffice: the tradition of the columned hall in architecture and fine gold work. The former can now be seen as belonging to an architectural tradition on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iranian plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iranian_Plateau</b></span> that extended back through the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> period to at least the beginning of the 1st millennium BC. The rich <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> gold work, which inscriptions suggest may have been a specialty of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>, was in the tradition of the delicate metalwork found in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iron Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iron_Age</b></span> II times at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hasanlu</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Teppe_Hasanlu</b></span> VI and still earlier at <span style='color: blue'><b>Marlik</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Persepolis</b></span>, primarily the creation of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>, is one of the great artistic legacies of the ancient world, with its carefully proportioned and well-organized ground plan, rich architectural ornament, and magnificent decorative reliefs.
<br>The organization and achievement of the Achaemenian <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span>
<br>At the centre of the empire sat the king of kings. Around him was gathered a court composed of powerful hereditary landholders, the upper echelons of the army, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>harem</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Harem</b></span>, religious functionaries, and the bureaucracy that administered the whole. This court lived mainly in <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span> but went in the hot summer months to <span style='color: blue'><b>Ecbatana</b></span> (modern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hamadān</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hamadan</b></span>), probably in the spring to <span style='color: blue'><b>Persepolis</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Fārs</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Fars_Province</b></span>, and perhaps sometimes to <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span>. In a smaller version it traveled with the king when he was away in the provinces.
<br>
<br>The provinces, or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrapies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span>, were ruled by satraps (governors), technically appointed by the central authority but who often became hereditary subkings, particularly in the later years of the empire. They were surrounded and assisted in their functions by a court modeled on that of the central government and were powerful officials. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The great king</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Great_King</b></span> was nevertheless theoretically able to maintain considerable control in local affairs. He was the last court of appeal in judicial matters. He directly controlled the standing military forces stationed in the provinces, though as time went on the military and civil authority in the provinces tended to become combined under the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span>. The king was also aided in keeping control in the provinces by the so-called king’s eyes or, better, the king’s ears—officials from the central government who traveled throughout the empire and who reported directly back to the king on what they learned. The number of provinces and their boundaries varied greatly from time to time; at the beginning of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>’s reign there were 20 provinces. In general, as time went on, the number increased, partly because of the need to reassert control over the satraps by decreasing their power base, partly because the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>feudal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Feudalism</b></span> structure that underlay <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> society required rewarding more and more people with a role in government, and partly because the original 20 provinces were undoubtedly simply too large to permit efficient administration.
<br>
<br>The army was a particularly important element within the empire. It, too, developed and changed with time. After <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tribal levy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Conscription</b></span>, based on the responsibility of all male <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> to fight for the king, was replaced by a professional <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>standing army</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Standing_army</b></span> supplemented by a troop levy from the subject peoples in times of intensive military activity. The elite of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>standing army</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Standing_army</b></span> were the 10,000 immortals, composed of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>, 1,000 of whom were the personal guard of the king. The person who controlled this elite guard, as did <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> on the death of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_I</b></span>, usually controlled all. The troops of the imperial levy fought alongside the regular army in national units, were armed according to their individual customs, but were usually officered by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. Permanent bodies of troops were stationed at strategic points throughout the empire, and, to judge from the garrison at <span style='color: blue'><b>Elephantine</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</b></span>, these were actually military colonies, firmly settled into the local countryside. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mercenaries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mercenary</b></span> were used with increasing frequency in later years, and many <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fought <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>faithfully</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Flat_module</b></span> for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> silver.
<br>
<br>Both the civil and the military administration, as well as public and private trade, were greatly facilitated by the famous royal <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> road system. Communications throughout the empire were better than any previous Middle Eastern power had maintained. The famous road from <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span> to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> in western <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> is the best known of these imperial highways. It was an all-weather road maintained by the state. Over it ran a governmental <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>postal system</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chapar_Khaneh</b></span> based on relay stations with remounts and fresh riders located a day’s ride apart. The speed with which a message could travel from the provinces to the king at <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span> was remarkable.
<br>
<br>On the whole, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule sat lightly on the subject peoples, at least under the early <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenids</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. It was a conscious policy of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> to permit conquered nations to retain their own religions, customs, methods of doing business, and even to some extent forms of government. This policy was exemplified by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>’s attitude toward the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylonia</b></span>, which led to his being accepted as the rightful successor of <span style='color: blue'><b>Nabonidus</b></span>, his willingness to permit the <span style='color: blue'><b>Jews</b></span> to return to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Palestine</span> <span style='color: green'><b>State_of_Palestine</b></span> and to their own way of life, and his successors’ concern that this promise be honoured; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_I</b></span>’ behaviour in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> and his acceptance by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> as founder of a legitimate new <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> dynasty; and the policy adopted under <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> toward the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> cities following their rebellion. Perhaps even in the later empire, rebellious peoples, governments, and leaders were too often forgiven and not suppressed with the thoroughness sometimes characteristic of other regimes. Lapses in this policy, such as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>’ violent reaction to rebellion in <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span>, stand out in the record.
<br>
<br>Law played an important role in the administration of the empire, and stories of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> justice abound in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> sources. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> particularly wished to be remembered as the great lawgiver, and law reform was one of the cornerstones in his program for reorganizing the empire. To judge from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylon</b></span> evidence, two sets of law, possibly administered by two sets of courts, were in force in the provinces. One was the local law, undoubtedly based on custom and previous local codifications; the other was the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, or imperial, law, based ultimately on the authority of the great king. A new word for law appeared in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Middle East</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Middle_East</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> times, the Iranian dāta, and was borrowed by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Semitic languages</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Semitic_languages</b></span> used in the empire. In <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylonia</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aramaic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aramaic_language</b></span>, sources give evidence for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> judges called by the Iranian word dāta-bar. These were probably the judges of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>imperial courts</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Imperial_Courts</b></span>.
<br>
<br>With legal reform came reform and unification of tax structures. The tax structure of the empire was apparently based on the principle that all of the conquered lands were the actual property of the king. Thus taxes were rather rents, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> and their land, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Fārs</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Fars_Province</b></span>, by virtue of not being a conquered people or land, were always tax-free. Each province was required to pay yearly a fixed amount in gold or silver, and each <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vassal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vassal</b></span> state paid a fixed tribute in kind. Again going on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylonia</b></span> evidence, in previous times agricultural taxes had been levied in fixed amounts regardless of the fluctuating quality of the harvest, but under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> all land was surveyed, an estimate of its yield (based on an average of the harvests over several years) was from time to time established, and taxes were levied in fixed amounts based on a percentage of that average yield. This was not quite an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>income tax</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Income_tax</b></span>, since it was not based on a percentage of each year’s production, but it was at least a reasonable figure based on a reasonable production average.
<br>
<br>Breakdowns often occurred in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenids</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>’ effort to maintain a productive balance between local social structures, customs, laws, and government and the demands of the empire. The failure of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> to find such a balance when dealing with what was for them an extremely strange system of social and political organization—the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> polis, or city-state—probably lay at the heart of their never-ending troubles in <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> as much as did the power and ambitions of mainland <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. Yet even the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span>, at the best of times, often realized the mutual advantages and benefits of the king’s peace and a unified western <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> under a tolerant central administration.
<br>
<br>The economy of the empire was very much founded on that king’s peace; it was when the peace broke down with ever-increasing frequency during the last century of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule that the economy of the empire went into a decline that undoubtedly contributed significantly to the eventual political and military collapse. Wealth in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> world was very much founded on land and on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>agriculture</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Agriculture</b></span>. Land was the principal reward that the king had available for those who gave service or who were in positions of great political or military power in the empire. Under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> there was a measure of land called a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>bow</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bow_and_arrow</b></span> that was originally a unit considered sufficient to support one bowman, who then paid his duty for the land in military service. At the other end of the scale were enormous family estates, which often increased in size over the years and which were or became hereditary holdings. They were often administered by absentee landlords. Such major landholdings were, as one would expect, usually in the hands of Iranians, but <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>non-Iranians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aniran</b></span> were also able to amass similar wealth and power, thereby testifying once again to the inherent tolerance with which the empire was administered. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenids</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> themselves took a positive role in encouraging <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>agriculture</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Agriculture</b></span> by investing state funds and effort in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>irrigation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Irrigation</b></span> and the improvement of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>horticulture</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Horticulture</b></span>.
<br>
<br>They also invested in and endeavoured to promote trade, a major source of imperial wealth. The effect of the state-maintained road system on the encouragement of trade has already been mentioned. Equal attention was paid to developing seaborne trade. State-sponsored voyages of exploration were undertaken in order to search for new markets and new resources. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> completed a project, begun by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span>, that connected the <span style='color: blue'><b>Nile</b></span> to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Red Sea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Red_Sea</b></span> by a canal, so that routes across the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Arabian Sea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Arabian_Sea</b></span> and into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian Gulf</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persian_Gulf</b></span> could be used to link the eastern and western ends of his empire. As part of the same program, port development on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian Gulf</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persian_Gulf</b></span> coast was encouraged. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Imperial</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> standardized weights and measures, efforts to develop and use coinage, and standardizing that coinage in the king’s name were all policies intended to encourage commerce and economic activity within the realm.
<br>
<br>Banking also played a role in the economy. Documents have survived from a family banking business in Babylonia—the house of Murashu and sons of Nippur—covering the years c. 455–403 BC; the firm evidently prospered greatly by lending money and by acting as a middleman in the system of tax collection. Interest rates were high, but borrowers were numerous.
<br>
<br>As time went on, there were clearly more and more such borrowers, for the later empire is marked by a general economic decline. The principal cause of this decline was the unsettled political conditions, but other, more indirect causes were unwise government interference in the economy, overtaxation, and the removal of too much <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hard money</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hard_currency</b></span> from the economy. Gold and silver tended to drain into the treasury of the central government from the provinces, and too little found its way back into general circulation. Disastrous <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>inflation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Inflation</b></span> was the result. The large sums of money paid to foreign <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mercenaries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mercenary</b></span> and as bribes to foreign governments must also have contributed to an unfavourable balance of payments that in turn stimulated <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>inflation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Inflation</b></span>. Such conditions hardly strengthened the empire and must have contributed, in ways that cannot be documented with certainty, to the political unrest that was their own main cause.
<br>
<br>Ultimately, the achievement of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> Persians was that they ruled with such creative tolerance over an area and a time that, for both the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Middle East</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Middle_East</b></span> and for <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>, included the end of the ancient and the beginning of the modern world. In one sense, the ancient <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Middle East</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Middle_East</b></span> died when <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> marched into <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span>. Others would argue that its death came when <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> burned <span style='color: blue'><b>Persepolis</b></span>. The question remains open. What is clear is that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> Empire—the largest anyone had ever yet tried to hold together and one that was not surpassed until Rome reached its height—was a profound force in western <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> and in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Europe</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Europe</b></span> during an important period of ferment and transition in human history. That era was one of major developments in art, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>philosophy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_philosophy</b></span>, literature, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>historiography</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Historiography</b></span>, religion, exploration, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>economics</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Economics</b></span>, and science, and those developments provided the direct background for the further changes, along similar lines, that made the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenistic period</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hellenistic_period</b></span> so important in history. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hellenistic_period</b></span> probably would not have been possible, at least not in the form we know it, if it had had to build directly on the rather more narrow and less ambitious bases of the individual civilizations of <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</b></span>, or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. In a sense, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> passed on a concept of empire that, much modified by others, has remained something of a model of how it is possible for diverse peoples with variant customs, languages, religions, laws, and economic systems to flourish with mutual profit under a central government. In narrower terms, but for the Iranians themselves no less important, the Achaemenian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> is seen as the beginning of the Iranian nation, one of the pivotal peoples in the modern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Middle East</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Middle_East</b></span>
