The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> (or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>) was an alliance of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states led by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and formed in 478 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> to liberate eastern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule and as a defence to possible revenge attacks from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> following the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> victories at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Plataea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Plataea</b></span> in the early 5th century <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. The alliance of over 300 cities would eventually be so dominated by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> that, in effect, it evolved into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> became increasingly more aggressive in its control of the alliance and, on occasion, constrained membership by military force and compelled continued tribute which was in the form of money, ships or materials. Following <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>’ defeat at the hands of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> in 404 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> the League was dissolved.
<br>
<br>The name <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> is a modern one, the ancient sources refer to it as simply ‘the alliance’ (symmachia) or ‘<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and its allies’. The name is appropriate because the treasury of the alliance was located on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sacred island</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sacred_Island</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Delos</b></span> in the <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyclades</b></span>. The number of members of the League changed over time but around 330 are recorded in tribute lists; sources which are known to be incomplete. The majority of states were from <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> and the islands but most parts of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> were represented and later there were even some non-Greek members such as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Carian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Carians</b></span> city-states. Prominent members included:
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Byzantium</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Chios</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Lesbos</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Lindos</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Paros</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thasos</b></span>
<br>
<br>Initially members swore to hold the same enemies and allies by taking an oath. It is likely that each <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city-state</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Polis</b></span> had an equal vote in meetings held on <span style='color: blue'><b>Delos</b></span>. Members were expected to give tribute (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phoros</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoros</b></span>) to the treasury which was used to build and maintain the naval fleet led by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>. Significantly too, the treasury was controlled by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> treasurers, the ten Hellenotamiae. The tribute in the early stages was 460 talents (raised in 425 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> to 1,500), a figure decided by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>statesman</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Winston_Churchill</b></span> and general Aristides. An alternative to providing money was to give ships and/or materials (especially timber) and grain.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> enjoyed some notable military victories such as at <span style='color: blue'><b>Eion</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thracian Chersonese</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gallipoli</b></span>, and most famously, at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Eurymedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Giants_(Greek_mythology)</b></span> in 466 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, all against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> forces. As a consequence <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> garrisons were removed from <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Chersonesus</b></span>. In 450 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> the League seemed to have achieved its aim if the Peace of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Kallias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Callias_III</b></span> is to be considered genuine. Here the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were limited in their field of influence and direct hostilities ended between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Other successes of the League were not military but economic and political, making them more difficult to determine in their significance and real effect for all members. <span style='color: blue'><b>Piracy</b></span> was practically eliminated in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span>, inter-city trade increased, a common coinage was introduced (the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> silver <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tetradrachm</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tetradrachm</b></span>), taxation became centralised, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span> as a form of government was promoted, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>judiciary</span> <span style='color: green'><b>European_Court_of_Justice</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> was accessible to member’s citizens, and such tools as measurement standards became uniform across the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span>. The primary beneficiary of all of these was certainly <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and the massive re-building project of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>, begun by <span style='color: blue'><b>Pericles</b></span> and which included the <span style='color: blue'><b>Parthenon</b></span>, was partially funded by the League treasury.
<br>
<br>The League and its requirement of tribute was not always to the liking of its members and some did try and leave, especially as the threat from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> gradually receded and the calls for tribute increased. A notable example is <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span> who sought to secede c. 467 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> responded in dramatic fashion by attacking the island and making it a semi-dependency, albeit with a lower tribute. <span style='color: blue'><b>Thasos</b></span> was another member who disagreed with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and wanted to keep control of its mines and trade centres. Again, the Athenians responded with force in 465 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> and lay <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span> to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> for three years. Eventually, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thasos</b></span> capitulated. 
<br>
<br>Already looking like an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>, two further episodes changed the League forever. In 460 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>First Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>First_Peloponnesian_War</b></span> broke out between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, and their allies. For the first time the League was being used against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> was off the agenda. Then c. 454 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> used the excuse of a failed League expedition in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</b></span> (to aid the anti-Persian prince <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Inarus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Inaros_II</b></span>) to move the League treasury to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The League became, thenceforth, ever more difficult to keep in toe. In 446 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> lost the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Koroneia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Koroneia,_Boeotia</b></span> and had to repress a major revolt in <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span>. An even more serious episode occurred when fighting between <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Miletos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> (both League members) was escalated by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> into a war. Again the Athenians’ superior resources brought them victory in 439 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. Yet another revolt broke out in Poteidaia in 432 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> which brought <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> in direct opposition to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>’s own alliance, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_League</b></span>. This second and much more damaging <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> (432-404 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>) against a Persian-backed <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> would eventually, after 30 years of gruelling and resource-draining conflicts, bring <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> to her knees and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ring</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Wrestling_ring</b></span> the death knell for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>. Such disastrous defeats as the 415 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sicilian Expedition</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sicilian_Expedition</b></span> and the brutal execution of all males on rebellious Melos the previous year were indicators of the desperate times. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>’ <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>glory days</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Little_Mix_discography</b></span> were gone and with them, so too, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The benefits of the League had been, certainly, mostly for the Athenians, nevertheless, it is significant that the realistic alternative – Spartan rule – would not have been and, from 404 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, was not any more popular for the lesser states of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. This is perhaps indicated by their willingness to re-join with, albeit a weaker and more militarily passive, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Second Athenian Confederacy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Second_Athenian_Empire</b></span> from 377 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>
