The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Olympic_Games?lang=en'>ancient Olympic Games</a> were a sporting event held every four years at the sacred site of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opel_Olympia?lang=en'>Olympia</a>, in the western <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnese?lang=en'>Peloponnese</a>, in honour of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zeus?lang=en'>Zeus</a>, the supreme god of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greek_religion?lang=en'>Greek religion</a>. Involving participants and spectators from all over <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> and even beyond, the Games were the most important cultural event in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>ancient Greece</a> and were held from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/776_BC?lang=en'>776 BCE</a> to 393 CE, a run of 293 consecutive Olympiads. So important were the Games in the ancient world that they were even used as a basis for the calendar.  
<br>
<br>Sporting events were originally associated with funeral rituals, particularly those of heroes and the fallen in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medieval_warfare?lang=en'>battle</a>, for example, the games for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patroclus?lang=en'>Patroklos</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer?lang=en'>Homer</a>â€™s <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iliad?lang=en'>Iliad</a>. At <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opel_Olympia?lang=en'>Olympia</a>, in particular, some mythological accounts credit <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zeus?lang=en'>Zeus</a> with beginning the Games to celebrate his victory over <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cronus?lang=en'>Kronos</a> whilst other accounts state the hero <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pelops?lang=en'>Pelops</a> began them in honour of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oenomaus?lang=en'>Oinomaos</a>. In any case, sport, a healthy body and the competitive spirit were a large part of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> education and so it is hardly surprising that organised athletic competitions would at some point be created, as they had been in the earlier <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minoan_civilization?lang=en'>Minoan</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mycenaean_Greece?lang=en'>Mycenaean</a> civilizations.
<br>
<br>The first Olympics were held from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/776_BC?lang=en'>776 BCE</a> at the first <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Full_moon?lang=en'>full moon</a> after the summer <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Winter_solstice?lang=en'>solstice</a> (around the middle of July) in honour of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zeus?lang=en'>Zeus</a>. The winner of the first and only event, the stadion foot-race was Koroibos of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elis?lang=en'>Elis</a> and from then on every victor was recorded and each <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Olympic_Games?lang=en'>Olympiad</a> named after them, thus giving us the first accurate chronology of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>ancient Greek</a> world. An <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Olympic_Games?lang=en'>Olympiad</a> was not only the name of the event itself but also of the period between games. During a three-month pan-Hellenic truce, athletes and as many as 40,000 spectators came from all over <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> to participate in the Games at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opel_Olympia?lang=en'>Olympia</a>. Later, other games would be organised at other sacred sites such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delphi?lang=en'>Delphi</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isthmian_Games?lang=en'>Isthmia</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nemean_Games?lang=en'>Nemea</a> but the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Olympic_Games?lang=en'>Olympian Games</a> would remain the most prestigious.
<br>
<br>The Games started with a procession which went from the host town of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elis?lang=en'>Elis</a> to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opel_Olympia?lang=en'>Olympia</a>, led by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hellanodikai?lang=en'>Hellanodikai</a> (judges) and on arrival at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opel_Olympia?lang=en'>Olympia</a> all athletes and officials swore an oath to follow the established rules of the competitions and to compete with honour and respect. The most important religious ceremony of the event was the sacrifice of 100 oxen, known as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hecatomb?lang=en'>hecatomb</a>, at the altar of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zeus?lang=en'>Zeus</a>, carried out when the sporting events were over.
<br>
<br>Heralds (spondophoroi) were sent from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elis?lang=en'>Elis</a> to advertise the coming of the Games across <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>. Spectators came from not only the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> mainland but also the islands, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magna_Graecia?lang=en'>Magna Graecia</a>. To facilitate the movement of spectators and athletes and in respect of the religious importance of the Games a sacred truce (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ekecheiria?lang=en'>ekecheiria</a>) was called across <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>. Initially, the truce was for one month but in later centuries it was extended to three. No wars were permitted, no arms could be carried in the territory of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elis?lang=en'>Elis</a> and no hindrance was to be given to any spectator, athlete or theoriai - (the official missions representing particular cities) travelling to the games from wherever they came from and whichever territory they had to cross.
<br>
<br>The site of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opel_Olympia?lang=en'>Olympia</a> must have been positively buzzing during a Games with mass crowds of excited spectators staying in make-shift camp sites (only later was accommodation provided for the visitors) and admiring the masses of fine statues and buildings at the site. Food vendors, craftsmen, musicians, poets and philosophers took full advantage of the crowds to publicise their wares or ideas. Just how many spectators attended each Games is unknown but we do know that around 45,000 spectators consisting of men, slaves and foreigners sat and watched from the embankments of the stadium which hosted the main events. Spectators actively participated in the events through their boisterous support of the athletes and after each event they showered flowers and laurel leaves on the victors.
<br>
<br>Women were not permitted to participate in or watch the events although young girls were allowed in the crowd. There was a single exception to this rule, the priestess of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Demeter?lang=en'>Demeter</a> Chamyne. A famous breach of the men only rule was the case of Kallipateira. She had trained her son Peisirodos and when he won his race his mother, celebrating a little too exuberantly in the crowd, loosened her clothes and revealed her sex. She escaped the prescribed punishment of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Capital_punishment?lang=en'>death penalty</a> because she came from a family of great Olympic victors but from then on all trainers had to be naked - like the athletes - to avoid such an occurrence in the future. 
<br>
<br>Athletes trained under the watchful <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_eye?lang=en'>eye</a> of a professional trainer (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gymnastes?lang=en'>gymnastes</a>) or physical trainer (paidotribes) who knew how to best develop particular muscles, the best diet and the correct amount of exercises to be done. Trainers were often thanked by their more successful athletes by the dedication of a statue of them at the site. Athletes also had an aleiptes who rubbed them down with oil and massaged them both before exercising and after.
<br>
<br>The athletes competed naked, probably for complete freedom of movement. Events were open to all free <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> males and the list of victors illustrates just how pan-Hellenic the Games were with athletes coming from all parts of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> and in Roman times the no-foreigner rule for athletes was relaxed. Victors were those who beat all other competitors. There are practically no records of times and distances achieved by victorious athletes as these were simply not considered important, the idea was to be first amongst the best, not to beat records. 
<br>
<br>For the first 12 Olympics the stadion foot-race was the only event and it remained the most prestigious event throughout the history of the Games. The race was ran over one length (a stadion) of the stadium track, 600 ancient feet or 192 m and preliminary heats were held with heat winners going into the final. Athletes were grouped by lot and in the interest of fairness this was also the way pairings were matched in the other events. The eventual winner of the stadion would even give his name to that particular Games and so be remembered for all time.
<br>
<br>Over time other events were added to the Games to bring the total programme to 18 events spread over five days:
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greek_units_of_measurement?lang=en'>diaulos</a> - the two stadium <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse?lang=en'>lengths</a> foot-race, added in 724 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anno_Domini?lang=en'>BCE</a>.
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dolichos_(race)?lang=en'>dolichos</a> - longer foot-races 7 to 20 stadium <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse?lang=en'>lengths</a>, added in 720 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anno_Domini?lang=en'>BCE</a>.
<br>wrestling - added in 708 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anno_Domini?lang=en'>BCE</a>. Competitors had to throw their opponent to the ground three times to gain victory. 
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pentathlon?lang=en'>pentathlon</a> - also added in 708 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anno_Domini?lang=en'>BCE</a>. All done in a single day, the event order was: jumping (in a soft soil pit using hand-weights or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Halteres?lang=en'>halteres</a> and accompanied to music), discuss (in stone, iron or bronze), stadion, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Javelin?lang=en'>javelin</a> (in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wood?lang=en'>wood</a> and thrown using a leather thong), and wrestling. Just how an athlete won the overall event is unclear, three event victories may have guaranteed overall victory.
<br>boxing - added in 688 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anno_Domini?lang=en'>BCE</a>. Athletes wore straps of leather (himantes) around their hands, initially as protection but they evolved into destructive weapons with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metalworking?lang=en'>metal</a> pieces added. Rules were limited to no low-blows and no holding. Serious injuries were common and deaths not unknown.
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chariot_racing?lang=en'>tethrippon</a> - the four-horse <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chariot_racing?lang=en'>chariot race</a> added in 680 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anno_Domini?lang=en'>BCE</a>, run over ten or twelve circuits of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hippodrome?lang=en'>hippodrome</a>. A version using foals over 8 circuits was added in 384 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anno_Domini?lang=en'>BCE</a>.
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Keles?lang=en'>keles</a> - a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse_racing?lang=en'>horse race</a> added in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/640s_BC?lang=en'>648 BCE</a> and run over 6 cicuits. A version for foals was added in 256 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anno_Domini?lang=en'>BCE</a>.
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pankration?lang=en'>pankration</a> - a mix of boxing and wrestling also added in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/640s_BC?lang=en'>648 BCE</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pankration?lang=en'>pankration</a> was a brutal event and the only moves not allowed were biting and gouging, although competitors did not wear the damaging leather thongs of the boxers.
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplitodromos?lang=en'>hoplitodromos</a> - the race in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>hoplite</a> armour (helmet, shield and spear) between 2 and 4 stadium <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse?lang=en'>lengths</a> was added in 520 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anno_Domini?lang=en'>BCE</a> and was usually the last event of the Games.
<br>apene - a race with chariots pulled by two mules, added in 500 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anno_Domini?lang=en'>BCE</a> (dropped from 444 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anno_Domini?lang=en'>BCE</a>).
<br>kalpe - a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harness_racing?lang=en'>trotting horse</a> race for mares, added in 496 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anno_Domini?lang=en'>BCE</a> (dropped from 444 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anno_Domini?lang=en'>BCE</a>).
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chariot_racing?lang=en'>synoris</a> - the two-horse <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chariot_racing?lang=en'>chariot race</a> run over eight circuits of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hippodrome?lang=en'>hippodrome</a>, added in 408 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anno_Domini?lang=en'>BCE</a>. A version using foals over three circuits was added in 268 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anno_Domini?lang=en'>BCE</a>.
<br>competitions for trumpeters and heralds - added in 396 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anno_Domini?lang=en'>BCE</a>. This was held on the first day and the winners - those whose sound carried the furthest - were also given the honour of announcing the victors on the final day at the official prize-giving event.
<br>
<br>Athletes had to arrive at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opel_Olympia?lang=en'>Olympia</a> one month before the Games for training and, further, they had to declare that they had been in training for at least <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ten_Months?lang=en'>ten months</a>. Non-Greeks, slaves, murderers, those convicted of defiling temples and all those who had not respected the truce were excluded from participating. Indeed, cities could be included in the latter category, for example, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> in 420 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anno_Domini?lang=en'>BCE</a>.   
<br>
<br>The events were supervised by trained judges from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elis?lang=en'>Elis</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hellanodikai?lang=en'>Hellanodikai</a> (or agonothetai) who also had various assistants such as the alytai (police officers). For the first 49 Olympics there was only one judge but he was joined by others to reach a peak of twelve, distributed amongst the various events. Originally, the office was hereditary and for life but later judges were selected from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elis?lang=en'>Elis</a> by lot. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hellanodikai?lang=en'>Hellanodikai</a> had the power to disqualify and fine athletes for any infringement of the rules and, wearing their purple cloaks, they were given special seats of honour in the stadium. The decisions of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hellanodikai?lang=en'>Hellanodikai</a> could never be revoked but the judges were themselves subject to judgment from a council of elders and should an athlete successfully appeal, the judge concerned could be fined.
<br>
<br>Rules were very rarely broken and when they were penalties were imposed ranging from exclusion and fines to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flagellation?lang=en'>flogging</a>. Fines were paid both to the sanctuary and the wronged athlete. If an offender did not pay the fine then the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> he represented had to or else be excluded from the next Games. Revenue from fines was in part used to erect statues of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zeus?lang=en'>Zeus</a> known as zanes and a number of  the bases of these statues can still be seen at the site today.
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hellanodikai?lang=en'>Hellanodikai</a> also gave out the victory crown (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Olive_wreath?lang=en'>kotinos</a>) of wild olive leaves and an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Olive?lang=en'>olive branch</a> cut from the scared tree (Kallistephanos) to each event winner. The olive was significant because the trees of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opel_Olympia?lang=en'>Olympia</a> were believed to have been originally planted by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heracles?lang=en'>Hercules</a>. Another prize could be a red woollen ribbon which was worn on the upper arm or around the head, especially for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chariot_racing?lang=en'>chariot</a> racers as it was the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse?lang=en'>horse</a> owner who actually received the olive crown.
<br>
<br>Victors were welcomed back to their hometowns as heroes after the Games. Typically entering the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> in a procession where they rode a four-horse <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chariot_racing?lang=en'>chariot</a>, the victors had huge banquets held in their honour and they could receive additional benefits such as exemption from tax and invitations to join the political elite. Cities also received prestige from victories at the Games and for this reason they sometimes offered financial incentives for athletes such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solon?lang=en'>Solon</a>â€™s 500 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_drachma?lang=en'>drachmas</a> prize (a substantial sum considering one <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sheep?lang=en'>sheep</a> cost one <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_drachma?lang=en'>drachma</a> at the time).
<br>
<br>However, the real prize for athletes was glory, fame and, in a very real sense, historical <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immortality?lang=en'>immortality</a>. This was achieved through renown whilst still alive but was perpetuated after death via victorâ€™s lists, personal statues and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epinikion?lang=en'>victory odes</a> written in the victorâ€™s honour.
<br>
<br>There were many great athletes who won fame and glory in multiple Games. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crotone?lang=en'>Kroton</a> from southern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Italy?lang=en'>Italy</a> won three consecutive stadion races from 488 to 480 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anno_Domini?lang=en'>BCE</a>. Phanas of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pellene?lang=en'>Pellene</a> managed to win three events in the Olympics of 521 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anno_Domini?lang=en'>BCE</a> - the stadion, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greek_units_of_measurement?lang=en'>diaulos</a> and the race in armour. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> of Rhodes went even better and managed to win all three events in four consecutive Olympics between 164 and 152 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anno_Domini?lang=en'>BCE</a>. A feat almost matched by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hermogenes_of_Priene?lang=en'>Hermogenes</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xanthos?lang=en'>Xanthos</a>, known as â€˜the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse?lang=en'>horse</a>â€™ who won eight running events over three Olympics between 81 and 89 CE. Milon of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crotone?lang=en'>Kroton</a> won the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wrestling?lang=en'>wrestling competition</a> five times from 532 to 516 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anno_Domini?lang=en'>BCE</a> and the runner Astylos of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crotone?lang=en'>Kroton</a> won six crowns across the three Olympics of 488, 484 and 480 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anno_Domini?lang=en'>BCE</a>. Finally, Herodoros of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Megara?lang=en'>Megara</a> won an incredible ten consecutive <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shofar?lang=en'>trumpet</a> competitions from 328 to 292 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anno_Domini?lang=en'>BCE</a>.
<br>
<br>The Games and their prestige also attracted famous competitors from outside the sporting world. The great <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens?lang=en'>Athenian</a> general and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scholar-official?lang=en'>statesman</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alcibiades?lang=en'>Alcibiades</a> won three <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chariot_racing?lang=en'>chariot races</a> in 416 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anno_Domini?lang=en'>BCE</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_II_of_Macedon?lang=en'>Philip II</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Macedonia?lang=en'>Macedon</a> won the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse_racing?lang=en'>horse race</a> in 356 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anno_Domini?lang=en'>BCE</a> and repeated his winning streak in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chariot_racing?lang=en'>chariot races</a> of the 352 and 348 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anno_Domini?lang=en'>BCE</a> Games. Also, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire?lang=en'>Roman emperor</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nero?lang=en'>Nero</a> famously won every event he entered in 65 CE. These powerful political leaders even sought to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat?lang=en'>milk</a> the prestige of their successes at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opel_Olympia?lang=en'>Olympia</a> by minting coins to commemorate their victories.
<br>
<br>The first woman to win the crown of victory was <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cynisca?lang=en'>Kyniska</a> in 392 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anno_Domini?lang=en'>BCE</a>. Although women were not permitted to compete, they could own horses and it was the owner who won the olive crown prize. Many other women went on to emulate <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cynisca?lang=en'>Kyniska</a> and Spartan women, in particular, enjoyed a high reputation in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Equestrianism?lang=en'>equestrian</a> events at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opel_Olympia?lang=en'>Olympia</a>.  
<br>
<br>The Games continued through the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hellenistic_period?lang=en'>Hellenistic period</a> with more buildings added to the site, greater comforts offered for the spectators and an increase in the professionalism and event specialisation of the athletes. In Roman times, although there were some changes to tradition such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sulla?lang=en'>Sulla</a>â€™s moving of the 80 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anno_Domini?lang=en'>BCE</a> Games to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome?lang=en'>Rome</a>, the Games continued to be popular and their prestige increased under <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philhellenism?lang=en'>hellenophile</a> emperors such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hadrian?lang=en'>Hadrian</a>. However, it was <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_emperor?lang=en'>Emperor</a>
