<span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> was an important ancient <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> and capital of the kingdom of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span>, located in western <span style='color: blue'><b>Anatolia</b></span>, present-day Sartmustafa, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Manisa province</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Manisa_Province</b></span> in western <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Turkey</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ottoman_Empire</b></span>. Its strategic location made it a central point connecting the interior of <span style='color: blue'><b>Anatolia</b></span> to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> coast. During its history, control of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> changed many times, but it always kept a high status among cities.
<br>
<br>Around 612 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, the greatest <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> in the world at that time, <span style='color: blue'><b>Nineveh</b></span>, was besieged and sacked by an allied army of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>, rebelling Chaldeans, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylonia</b></span>, putting an end to the Assyrian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span>. This event shaped a new political map: <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span> became the imperial centre of <span style='color: blue'><b>Mesopotamia</b></span> and the kingdom of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span> became the dominant power in western <span style='color: blue'><b>Anatolia</b></span> with <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> as its capital.
<br>
<br>The life of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> began as a hilltop <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>citadel</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Citadel</b></span> where the king of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span> lived. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> developed into a two part town: the lower town, located along the banks of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pactolus river</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pactolus</b></span>, where the ordinary citizens lived, and the upper town for the wealthy citizens, royal members, and the palace. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> wrote that the lower town was a modest place with many of its houses made of reeds from the river and with no surrounding wall.
<br>
<br>To the west, <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span> had the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek colonies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Colonies_in_antiquity</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>. After the fall of <span style='color: blue'><b>Assyria</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span> was free to turn its attention to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> cities, which became dominated by <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> rulers, however, admired the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and treated the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> cities leniently. Moreover, <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span>, the last <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> king, even paid for the construction of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_temple</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemis</b></span>, which became one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Thus, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> coast city-states and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> remained on peaceful terms with very tight cultural and commercial relations. <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> was a centre for the traffic of goods and ideas between <span style='color: blue'><b>Mesopotamia</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> settlements, a crossroad of trade, and an ideal meeting point for the exchange of ideas, beliefs, customs, knowledge, and new insights. This rich exchange was one of the factors that, around 600 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, allowed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> cities to turn into the intellectual leaders of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> world.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> (1.31) claims that on one occasion <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> was visited by <span style='color: blue'><b>Solon</b></span>, a famous <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> lawmaker and statesman and one of the seven proverbial wise men of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ancient Hellas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, who met <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> king. This meeting between <span style='color: blue'><b>Solon</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span> is certainly a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>fiction</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Time_travel_in_fiction</b></span>: <span style='color: blue'><b>Solon</b></span>, if we <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>trust</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Trust_law</b></span> the current accepted chronology, must have been dead several years before 560 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, the year when <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span> became king of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span>. Nevertheless, according to the story <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span> was <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>overjoyed</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Overjoyed_(Stevie_Wonder_song)</b></span> to have such an important visitor and was anxious to display his wealth to the well-travelled <span style='color: blue'><b>Solon</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span> finally asked <span style='color: blue'><b>Solon</b></span> who, of all the men he had met in his travels, he would call the most happy. <span style='color: blue'><b>Solon</b></span> replied, “<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tellus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Earth</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>.” This made <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span> upset since he expected to be named first. <span style='color: blue'><b>Solon</b></span> added that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tellus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Earth</b></span> had lived well and happily, had a beautiful family, and had died gloriously for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span> agreed this was a good life and asked <span style='color: blue'><b>Solon</b></span> who else he would consider to be among the happiest of men he had met, hoping he would at least be named second. <span style='color: blue'><b>Solon</b></span> answered “<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleobis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kleobis_and_Biton</b></span> and Biton”, two <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> brothers who had enough resources to live, great fitness levels, and who had died honourably. <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span>, angered now, shouted, "My <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> guest, are you disparaging my own happiness as though it were nothing?, Do you think me less than a common man?" <span style='color: blue'><b>Solon</b></span> replied that no person can be judged fortunate until their death: "I cannot yet tell you the answer you asked for until I learn how you have ended your life."
<br>
<br>When <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>, King of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, invaded <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> in 547 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, it became obvious that the lack of a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>defensive wall</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Defensive_wall</b></span> protecting the lower <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> was not a wise choice. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> king <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span> simply retreated to the upper town, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army controlled the lower <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> with very little resistance. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army finally found an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>unguarded</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Unguarded_(Amy_Grant_album)</b></span> spot in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>citadel</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Citadel</b></span>’s defences, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> came under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> control for the next two centuries.
<br>
<br>During the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> occupation, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> did not change much: A <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> garrison was built on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>acropolis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Acropolis</b></span> while the lower town settlements remained unchanged. An altar of <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemis</b></span> is mentioned by <span style='color: blue'><b>Xenophon</b></span>, possibly in the southern portion of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>acropolis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Acropolis</b></span>, in the settlements along the river, where some time later a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_temple</b></span> to the goddess was built.
<br>
<br>Once <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> was taken, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> also occupied the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> cities. About 500 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> cities dismissed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> authorities and declared their independence, triggering the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> as the leading state, the first of many military conflicts between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. A <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army marched upon <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> and burned it to the ground. This is how <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> reports the incident:
<br>
<br>When the Athenians, the Eretrians, and the rest of the allies had arrived and were present in <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> organized an expedition against <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>. they <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>journeyed</span> <span style='color: green'><b>JourneyEd</b></span> inland in massive force, with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ephesians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephesus</b></span> as their guides. They travelled along the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cayster River</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Küçükmenderes_River</b></span>, crossed over Mount <span style='color: blue'><b>Tmolus</b></span>, and came to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>, where they captured the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> without resistance from anyone whatsoever. They took control of everything except the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>acropolis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Acropolis</b></span>. For <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> [the brother of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> king, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>] himself defended the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>acropolis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Acropolis</b></span> with a rather large force of men.
<br>
<br>Although they had taken the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>, they were unable to plunder it because most of the houses in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> were constructed of reeds [...] and when a soldier set one of these houses on fire, the flames spread rapidly from house to house until they engulfed the entire <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>.
<br>
<br>A number of changes took place in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> surrendered to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> in 334 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. A new lower town was built to the north of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Acropolis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pergamon</b></span> and the old town was gradually abandoned, with the sole exception of the Temple of <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemis</b></span> and its surrounding area, where a few citizens continued to live. The new lower town had the east-west road as its axis which connected the interior to the coast.
<br>
<br>A number of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenistic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hellenistic_period</b></span> public buildings were built in the new town including a stadium and a theatre. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> was walled at some point before the year 215 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> as attested to by ancient reports that, when the troops led by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Seleucid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Seleucid_Empire</b></span> ruler <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Antiochus III</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Antiochus_III_the_Great</b></span> assaulted <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> that year, they penetrated across a section of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> wall near the theatre. <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> was then made <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Seleucid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Seleucid_Empire</b></span>’s administrative centre for the <span style='color: blue'><b>Anatolia</b></span> region.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> came under Roman rule in 133 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. During this time, it remained an important <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> and was the principal centre of a judicial district that included almost 30 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phrygian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phrygia</b></span> settlements. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> was eventually made a provincial capital when <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span> was re-established as an administrative centre.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tacitus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pliny_the_Elder</b></span> reports an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>earthquake</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Earthquake</b></span> that affected the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> in 17 CE:
<br>
<br>That same year twelve famous cities of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> fell by an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>earthquake</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Earthquake</b></span> in the night, so that the destruction was all the more unforeseen and fearful. Nor were there the means of escape usual in, such a disaster, by rushing out into the open country, for there people were swallowed up by the yawning earth. Vast mountains, it is said, collapsed; what had been level ground seemed to be raised aloft, and fires blazed out amid the ruin. The calamity fell most fatally on the inhabitants of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>, and it attracted to them the largest share of sympathy.
<br>
<br>During the second and early 3rd century CE, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> expanded to the west. At the beginning of the 5th century a wall enclosing 156 hectares was built. Then in the year 616 CE, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>' life came to an end. A <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army penetrated the Roman defensive lines that had been deployed in eastern <span style='color: blue'><b>Anatolia</b></span>. Soon after, part of that region fell to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, including <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> fortifications could not do much to stop the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> troops, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> was sacked and devastated so completely that no attempt to restore the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> has been recorded. This incident constitutes the end of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>’ civic life. A military detachment regained the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>citadel</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Citadel</b></span> in 660 CE, but the town itself remained empty and all subsequent references to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> are to the castle on the hill, never to the town.
<br>
<br>Since 1958 CE, the universities of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Harvard</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Harvard_University</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cornell</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cornell_University</b></span> have been performing annual excavations at <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>. As part of these works, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>’ <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>gymnasium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gym</b></span> has been restored and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>synagogue</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Synagogue</b></span> was discovered in 1962 CE, a building measuring over 91.4 metres (300 feet) in length. Some of the important finds from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>archaeological site</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archaeological_site</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> are kept in the Archaeological Museum of <span style='color: blue'><b>Manisa</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Turkey</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ottoman_Empire</b></span>, including many Roman mosaics and sculptures and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pottery</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_art</b></span> from different periods in the history of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>
