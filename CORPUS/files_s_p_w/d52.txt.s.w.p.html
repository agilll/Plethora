The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_War</a> (431–404 BC) was an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> war fought by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Delian_League</a> led by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> against the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_League?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_League</a> led by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>. Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases. In the first phase, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_War</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> launched repeated invasions of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attica?lang=en'>Attica</a>, while <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnese?lang=en'>Peloponnese</a> and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire. This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC, with the signing of the Peace of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicias?lang=en'>Nicias</a>. That treaty, however, was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnese?lang=en'>Peloponnese</a>. In 415 BC, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syracuse_Orange_football?lang=en'>Syracuse_Orange_football</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily?lang=en'>Sicily</a>; the attack failed disastrously, with the destruction of the entire force, in 413 BC. This ushered in the final phase of the war, generally referred to either as the Decelean War, or the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a> War. In this phase, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>, now receiving support from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>, supported rebellions in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>' subject states in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegean_Sea?lang=en'>Aegean_Sea</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a>, undermining <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>' empire, and, eventually, depriving the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> of naval supremacy. The destruction of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>' fleet at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Aegospotami?lang=en'>Battle_of_Aegospotami</a> effectively ended the war, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> surrendered in the following year. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia?lang=en'>Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia</a> demanded that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> should be destroyed and all its citizens should be enslaved, but <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> refused.
<br>
<br>The term "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_War</a> " was never used by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>, by far its major historian: that the term is all but universally used today is a reflection of the Athens-centric sympathies of modern historians. As prominent historian J. B. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bury?lang=en'>Bury</a> remarks, the Peloponnesians would have considered it the "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attic_War?lang=en'>Attic_War</a>".[1]
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_War</a> reshaped the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> world. On the level of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_law?lang=en'>International_law</a> relations, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, the strongest <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polis?lang=en'>Polis</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> prior to the war's beginning, was reduced to a state of near-complete subjection, while <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> became established as the leading power of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>. The economic costs of the war were felt all across <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>; <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poverty?lang=en'>Poverty</a> became widespread in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnese?lang=en'>Peloponnese</a>, while <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> found itself completely devastated, and never regained its pre-war prosperity.[2][3] The war also wrought subtler changes to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> society; the conflict between democratic <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oligarchy?lang=en'>Oligarchy</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>, each of which supported friendly political factions within other states, made <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Civil_war?lang=en'>Civil_war</a> a common occurrence in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> world.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> warfare, meanwhile, originally a limited and formalized form of conflict, was transformed into an all-out struggle between city-states, complete with atrocities on a large scale. Shattering religious and cultural taboos, devastating vast swathes of countryside, and destroying whole cities, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_War</a> marked the dramatic end to the fifth century BC and the golden age of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>.[4]
<br>
<br>As the preeminent <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> historian, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>, wrote in his influential History of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_War</a>, "The growth of the power of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, and the alarm which this inspired in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>, made war inevitable."[5] Indeed, the nearly fifty years of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> history that preceded the outbreak of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_War</a> had been marked by the development of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> as a major power in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mediterranean_Sea?lang=en'>Mediterranean_Sea</a> world. Its empire began as a small group of city-states, called the Delian League—from the island of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delos?lang=en'>Delos</a>, on which they kept their treasury—that came together to ensure that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greco-Persian_Wars?lang=en'>Greco-Persian_Wars</a> were truly over. After defeating the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> invasion of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> in the year 480 BC, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> led the coalition of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> city-states that continued the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greco-Persian_Wars?lang=en'>Greco-Persian_Wars</a> with attacks on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> territories in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegean_Sea?lang=en'>Aegean_Sea</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a>. What then ensued was a period, referred to as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pentecontaetia?lang=en'>Pentecontaetia</a> (the name given by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>), in which <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> increasingly became in fact an empire,[6] carrying out an aggressive war against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> and increasingly dominating other city-states. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> proceeded to bring under its control all of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> except for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> and its allies, ushering in a period which is known to history as the Athenian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire?lang=en'>Roman_Empire</a>. By the middle of the century, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> had been driven from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegean_Sea?lang=en'>Aegean_Sea</a> and forced to cede control of a vast range of territories to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>. At the same time, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> greatly increased its own power; a number of its formerly independent allies were reduced, over the course of the century, to the status of tribute-paying subject states of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Delian_League</a>. This tribute was used to support a powerful fleet and, after the middle of the century, to fund massive <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public_works?lang=en'>Public_works</a> programs in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, causing resentment.[7]
<br>
<br>Friction between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> and the Peloponnesian states, including <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>, began early in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pentecontaetia?lang=en'>Pentecontaetia</a>; in the wake of the departure of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> attempted to prevent the reconstruction of the walls of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> (without the walls, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> would have been <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Defenseless?lang=en'>Defenseless</a> against a land attack and subject to Spartan control), but was rebuffed.[8] According to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>, although the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> took no action at this time, they "secretly felt aggrieved".[9] Conflict between the states flared up again in 465 BC, when a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helots?lang=en'>Helots</a> revolt broke out in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> summoned forces from all of their allies, including <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, to help them suppress the revolt. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> sent out a sizable contingent (4,000 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a>), but upon its arrival, this force was dismissed by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a>, while those of all the other allies were permitted to remain. According to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> acted in this way out of fear that the Athenians would switch sides and support the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helots?lang=en'>Helots</a>; the offended Athenians repudiated their alliance with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>.[10] When the rebellious <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helots?lang=en'>Helots</a> were finally forced to surrender and permitted to evacuate the state, the Athenians settled them at the strategic <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nafpaktos?lang=en'>Nafpaktos</a> on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gulf_of_Corinth?lang=en'>Gulf_of_Corinth</a>.[11]
<br>
<br>In <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/459_BC?lang=en'>459_BC</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> took advantage of a war between its neighbors <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Megara?lang=en'>Megara</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a>, both Spartan allies, to conclude an alliance with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Megara?lang=en'>Megara</a>, giving the Athenians a critical foothold on the Isthmus of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a>. A fifteen-year conflict, commonly known as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>First_Peloponnesian_War</a>, ensued, in which <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> fought intermittently against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegina?lang=en'>Aegina</a>, and a number of other states. For a time during this conflict, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> controlled not only <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Megara?lang=en'>Megara</a> but also <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeotia?lang=en'>Boeotia</a>; at its end, however, in the face of a massive Spartan invasion of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attica?lang=en'>Attica</a>, the Athenians ceded the lands they had won on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> mainland, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> recognized each other's right to control their respective alliance systems.[12] The war was officially ended by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thirty_Years'_Peace?lang=en'>Thirty_Years'_Peace</a>, signed in the winter of 446/5 BC.[13]
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thirty_Years'_Peace?lang=en'>Thirty_Years'_Peace</a> was first tested in 440 BC, when <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>' powerful ally <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samos?lang=en'>Samos</a> rebelled from its alliance with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>. The rebels quickly secured the support of a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satrap?lang=en'>Satrap</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> found itself facing the prospect of revolts throughout the empire. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a>, whose intervention would have been the trigger for a massive war to determine the fate of the empire, called a congress of their allies to discuss the possibility of war with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>'s powerful ally <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a> was notably opposed to intervention, and the congress voted against war with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>. The Athenians crushed the revolt, and peace was maintained.[14]
<br>
<br>The more immediate events that led to war involved <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a>. After suffering a defeat at the hands of their <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colonies_in_antiquity?lang=en'>Colonies_in_antiquity</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corfu?lang=en'>Corfu</a>, a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naval_warfare?lang=en'>Naval_warfare</a> that was not allied to either <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a> began to build an allied naval force. Alarmed, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corfu?lang=en'>Corfu</a> sought an alliance with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, which after debate and input from both <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corfu?lang=en'>Corfu</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a>, decided to swear a defensive alliance with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corfu?lang=en'>Corfu</a>. At the Battle of Sybota, a small contingent of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> ships played a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Critical_Role?lang=en'>Critical_Role</a> in preventing a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a> fleet from capturing <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corfu?lang=en'>Corfu</a>. In order to uphold the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thirty_Years'_Peace?lang=en'>Thirty_Years'_Peace</a>, however, the Athenians were instructed not to intervene in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a> unless it was clear that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a> was going to press onward to invade <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corfu?lang=en'>Corfu</a>. However, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trireme?lang=en'>Trireme</a> participated in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a> nevertheless, and the arrival of additional <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trireme?lang=en'>Trireme</a> was enough to dissuade the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Corinth?lang=en'>Ancient_Corinth</a> from exploiting their victory, thus sparing much of the routed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corfu?lang=en'>Corfu</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> fleet.[15]
<br>
<br>Following this, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> instructed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Potidaea?lang=en'>Potidaea</a> (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chalkidiki?lang=en'>Chalkidiki</a> peninsula), a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tribute?lang=en'>Tribute</a> ally of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> but a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colonies_in_antiquity?lang=en'>Colonies_in_antiquity</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a>, to tear down its walls, send hostages to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, dismiss the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a> magistrates from office, and refuse the magistrates that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> would send in the future.[16] The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Corinth?lang=en'>Ancient_Corinth</a>, outraged by these actions, encouraged <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Potidaea?lang=en'>Potidaea</a> to revolt and assured them that they would ally with them should they revolt from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>. Meanwhile, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Corinth?lang=en'>Ancient_Corinth</a> were unofficially aiding <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Potidaea?lang=en'>Potidaea</a> by sneaking contingents of men into the besieged <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> to help defend it. This was a direct violation of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thirty_Years'_Peace?lang=en'>Thirty_Years'_Peace</a>, which had (among other things) stipulated that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Delian_League</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_League?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_League</a> would respect each other's autonomy and internal affairs.
<br>
<br>A further source of provocation was an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> decree, issued in 433/2 BC, imposing stringent trade sanctions on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Megara?lang=en'>Megara</a> citizens (once more a Spartan ally after the conclusion of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>First_Peloponnesian_War</a>). It was alleged that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Megara?lang=en'>Megara</a> had desecrated the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hiera_Orgas?lang=en'>Hiera_Orgas</a>. These sanctions, known as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Megarian_decree?lang=en'>Megarian_decree</a>, were largely ignored by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>, but some modern economic historians have noted that forbidding <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Megara?lang=en'>Megara</a> to trade with the prosperous <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Delian_League</a> would have been disastrous for the Megarans, and have accordingly considered the decree to be a contributing factor in bringing about the war.[17] Historians that attribute responsibility for the war to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> cite this event as the main cause for blame.[18]
<br>
<br>At the request of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Corinth?lang=en'>Ancient_Corinth</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> summoned members of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_League?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_League</a> to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> in 432 BC, especially those who had grievances with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> to make their complaints to the Spartan assembly. This debate was attended by members of the league and an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Uninvited_(song)?lang=en'>Uninvited_(song)</a> delegation from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, which also asked to speak, and became the scene of a debate between the Athenians and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Corinth?lang=en'>Ancient_Corinth</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> reports that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Corinth?lang=en'>Ancient_Corinth</a> condemned <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>'s inactivity up to that point, warning the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> that if they continued to remain passive while the Athenians were energetically active, they would soon find themselves outflanked and without allies.[19] The Athenians, in response, reminded the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> of their record of military success and opposition to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>, and warned them of the dangers of confronting such a powerful state, ultimately encouraging <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> to seek arbitration as provided by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thirty_Years'_Peace?lang=en'>Thirty_Years'_Peace</a>.[20] Undeterred, a majority of the Spartan assembly voted to declare that the Athenians had broken the peace, essentially declaring war.[21]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> and its allies, with the exception of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a>, were almost exclusively land-based powers, able to summon large land armies which were very nearly unbeatable (thanks to the legendary Spartan forces). The Athenian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire?lang=en'>Roman_Empire</a>, although based in the peninsula of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attica?lang=en'>Attica</a>, spread out across the islands of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegean_Sea?lang=en'>Aegean_Sea</a>; <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> drew its immense wealth from tribute paid from these islands. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> maintained its empire through naval power. Thus, the two powers were relatively unable to fight decisive battles.
<br>
<br>The Spartan strategy during the first war, known as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_War</a> (431–421 BC) after <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>'s king <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archidamus_II?lang=en'>Archidamus_II</a>, was to invade the land surrounding <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>. While this invasion deprived Athenians of the productive land around their <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> itself was able to maintain access to the sea, and did not suffer much. Many of the citizens of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attica?lang=en'>Attica</a> abandoned their farms and moved inside the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Long_Walls?lang=en'>Long_Walls</a>, which connected <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> to its port of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piraeus?lang=en'>Piraeus</a>. At the end of the first year of the war, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pericles?lang=en'>Pericles</a> gave his famous <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pericles'_Funeral_Oration?lang=en'>Pericles'_Funeral_Oration</a> (431 BC).
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> also occupied <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attica?lang=en'>Attica</a> for periods of only three weeks at a time; in the tradition of earlier <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> warfare the soldiers were expected to go home to participate in the harvest. Moreover, Spartan slaves, known as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helots?lang=en'>Helots</a>, needed to be kept under control, and could not be left unsupervised for long periods of time. The longest Spartan invasion, in 430 BC, lasted just forty days.
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> strategy was initially guided by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strategos?lang=en'>Strategos</a>, or general, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pericles?lang=en'>Pericles</a>, who advised the Athenians to avoid open <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a> with the far more numerous and better trained Spartan <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a>, relying instead on the fleet. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> fleet, the most dominant in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>, went on the offensive, winning a victory at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nafpaktos?lang=en'>Nafpaktos</a>. In 430 BC an outbreak of a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Black_Death?lang=en'>Black_Death</a> hit <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Black_Death?lang=en'>Black_Death</a> ravaged the densely packed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a>, and in the long run, was a significant cause of its final defeat. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Black_Death?lang=en'>Black_Death</a> wiped out over 30,000 citizens, sailors and soldiers, including <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pericles?lang=en'>Pericles</a> and his sons. Roughly one-third to two-thirds of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> population died. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> manpower was correspondingly drastically reduced and even foreign <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mercenary?lang=en'>Mercenary</a> refused to hire themselves out to a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> riddled with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Black_Death?lang=en'>Black_Death</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_characters_in_the_Metal_Gear_series?lang=en'>List_of_characters_in_the_Metal_Gear_series</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Black_Death?lang=en'>Black_Death</a> was so widespread that the Spartan invasion of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attica?lang=en'>Attica</a> was abandoned, their troops being unwilling to risk contact with the diseased enemy.
<br>
<br>After the death of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pericles?lang=en'>Pericles</a>, the Athenians turned somewhat against his conservative, defensive strategy and to the more aggressive strategy of bringing the war to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> and its allies. Rising to particular importance in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athenian_democracy?lang=en'>Athenian_democracy</a> at this time was <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cleon?lang=en'>Cleon</a>, a leader of the hawkish elements of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athenian_democracy?lang=en'>Athenian_democracy</a>. Led militarily by a clever new general <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Demosthenes?lang=en'>Demosthenes</a> (not to be confused with the later <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> orator <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Demosthenes?lang=en'>Demosthenes</a>), the Athenians managed some successes as they continued their naval raids on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnese?lang=en'>Peloponnese</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> stretched their military activities into <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeotia?lang=en'>Boeotia</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aetolia?lang=en'>Aetolia</a>, quelled the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mytilenean_revolt?lang=en'>Mytilenean_revolt</a> and began fortifying posts around the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnese?lang=en'>Peloponnese</a>. One of these posts was near <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pylos?lang=en'>Pylos</a> on a tiny island called <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sphacteria?lang=en'>Sphacteria</a>, where the course of the first war turned in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>'s favour. The post off <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pylos?lang=en'>Pylos</a> struck <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> where it was weakest: its <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Substance_dependence?lang=en'>Substance_dependence</a> on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helots?lang=en'>Helots</a>, who tended the fields while its citizens trained to become soldiers. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helots?lang=en'>Helots</a> made the Spartan system possible, but now the post off <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pylos?lang=en'>Pylos</a> began attracting <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helots?lang=en'>Helots</a> runaways. In addition, the fear of a general revolt of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helots?lang=en'>Helots</a> emboldened by the nearby <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> presence drove the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> to action. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Demosthenes?lang=en'>Demosthenes</a>, however, outmanoeuvred the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> in the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pylos?lang=en'>Pylos</a> in 425 BC and trapped a group of Spartan soldiers on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sphacteria?lang=en'>Sphacteria</a> as he waited for them to surrender. Weeks later, though, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Demosthenes?lang=en'>Demosthenes</a> proved unable to finish off the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a>. After boasting that he could put an end to the affair in the Assembly, the inexperienced <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cleon?lang=en'>Cleon</a> won a great victory at the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sphacteria?lang=en'>Sphacteria</a>. The Athenians captured 300 Spartan <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Hostages?lang=en'>The_Hostages</a> gave the Athenians a bargaining chip.
<br>
<br>After these battles, the Spartan general <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brasidas?lang=en'>Brasidas</a> raised an army of allies and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helots?lang=en'>Helots</a> and marched the length of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colonies_in_antiquity?lang=en'>Colonies_in_antiquity</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amphipolis?lang=en'>Amphipolis</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrace?lang=en'>Thrace</a>, which controlled several nearby silver mines; their product supplied much of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> war fund. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> was dispatched with a force which arrived too late to stop <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brasidas?lang=en'>Brasidas</a> capturing <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amphipolis?lang=en'>Amphipolis</a>; <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> was exiled for this, and, as a result, had the conversations with both sides of the war which inspired him to record its history. Both <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brasidas?lang=en'>Brasidas</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cleon?lang=en'>Cleon</a> were killed in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> efforts to retake <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amphipolis?lang=en'>Amphipolis</a> (see Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amphipolis?lang=en'>Amphipolis</a>). The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> and Athenians agreed to exchange the hostages for the towns captured by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brasidas?lang=en'>Brasidas</a>, and signed a truce.
<br>
<br>With the death of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cleon?lang=en'>Cleon</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brasidas?lang=en'>Brasidas</a>, zealous war hawks for both nations, the Peace of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicias?lang=en'>Nicias</a> was able to last for some six years. However, it was a time of constant skirmishing in and around the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnese?lang=en'>Peloponnese</a>. While the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> refrained from action themselves, some of their allies began to talk of revolt. They were supported in this by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Argos?lang=en'>Argos</a>, a powerful state within the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnese?lang=en'>Peloponnese</a> that had remained independent of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>. With the support of the Athenians, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Argos?lang=en'>Argos</a> succeeded in forging a coalition of democratic states within the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnese?lang=en'>Peloponnese</a>, including the powerful states of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mantineia?lang=en'>Mantineia</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elis?lang=en'>Elis</a>. Early Spartan attempts to break up the coalition failed, and the leadership of the Spartan king <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Agis_II?lang=en'>Agis_II</a> was called into question. Emboldened, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Argos?lang=en'>Argos</a> and their allies, with the support of a small <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> force under <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alcibiades?lang=en'>Alcibiades</a>, moved to seize the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tegea?lang=en'>Tegea</a>, near <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>.
<br>
<br>The Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mantineia?lang=en'>Mantineia</a> was the largest land <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a> fought within <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> during the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_War</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>, with their neighbors the Tegeans, faced the combined armies of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Argos?lang=en'>Argos</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mantineia?lang=en'>Mantineia</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arcadia?lang=en'>Arcadia</a>. In the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a>, the allied coalition scored early successes, but failed to capitalize on them, which allowed the Spartan <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Special_forces?lang=en'>Special_forces</a> to defeat the forces opposite them. The result was a complete victory for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a>, which rescued their <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> from the brink of strategic defeat. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democratic_Alliance_of_Chile?lang=en'>Democratic_Alliance_of_Chile</a> was broken up, and most of its members were reincorporated into the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_League?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_League</a>. With its victory at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mantineia?lang=en'>Mantineia</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> pulled itself back from the brink of utter defeat, and re-established its <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hegemony?lang=en'>Hegemony</a> throughout the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnese?lang=en'>Peloponnese</a>.
<br>
<br>In the 17th year of the war, word came to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> that one of their distant allies in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily?lang=en'>Sicily</a> was under attack from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syracuse_Orange_football?lang=en'>Syracuse_Orange_football</a>. The people of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syracuse_Orange_football?lang=en'>Syracuse_Orange_football</a> were ethnically <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dorians?lang=en'>Dorians</a> (as were the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a>), while the Athenians, and their ally in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily?lang=en'>Sicily</a>, were <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a>. The Athenians felt obliged to assist their ally.
<br>
<br>The Athenians did not act solely from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Altruism?lang=en'>Altruism</a>: rallied on by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alcibiades?lang=en'>Alcibiades</a>, the leader of the expedition, they held visions of conquering all of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily?lang=en'>Sicily</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syracuse_Orange_football?lang=en'>Syracuse_Orange_football</a>, the principal <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily?lang=en'>Sicily</a>, was not much smaller than <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, and conquering all of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily?lang=en'>Sicily</a> would have brought <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> an immense amount of resources. In the final stages of the preparations for departure, the hermai (religious statues) of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> were mutilated by unknown persons, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alcibiades?lang=en'>Alcibiades</a> was charged with religious crimes. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alcibiades?lang=en'>Alcibiades</a> demanded that he be put on trial at once, so that he might defend himself before the expedition. The Athenians however allowed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alcibiades?lang=en'>Alcibiades</a> to go on the expedition without being tried (many believed in order to better plot against him). After arriving in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily?lang=en'>Sicily</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alcibiades?lang=en'>Alcibiades</a> was recalled to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> for trial. Fearing that he would be unjustly condemned, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alcibiades?lang=en'>Alcibiades</a> defected to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicias?lang=en'>Nicias</a> was placed in charge of the mission. After his defection, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alcibiades?lang=en'>Alcibiades</a> claimed to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> that the Athenians planned to use <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily?lang=en'>Sicily</a> as a springboard for the conquest of all of Italy and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carthage?lang=en'>Carthage</a>, and to use the resources and soldiers from these new conquests to conquer the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnese?lang=en'>Peloponnese</a>.
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> force consisted of over 100 ships and some 5,000 infantry and light-armored troops. Cavalry was limited to about 30 horses, which proved to be no match for the large and highly trained <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syracuse,_Sicily?lang=en'>Syracuse,_Sicily</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>Cavalry</a>. Upon landing in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily?lang=en'>Sicily</a>, several cities immediately joined the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> cause. Instead of attacking at once, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicias?lang=en'>Nicias</a> procrastinated and the campaigning season of 415 BC ended with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syracuse_Orange_football?lang=en'>Syracuse_Orange_football</a> scarcely damaged. With winter approaching, the Athenians were then forced to withdraw into their quarters, and they spent the winter gathering allies and preparing to destroy <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syracuse_Orange_football?lang=en'>Syracuse_Orange_football</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Delay?lang=en'>The_Delay</a> allowed the Syracusans to send for help from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>, who sent their general <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gylippus?lang=en'>Gylippus</a> to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily?lang=en'>Sicily</a> with reinforcements. Upon arriving, he raised up a force from several <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily?lang=en'>Sicily</a> cities, and went to the relief of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syracuse_Orange_football?lang=en'>Syracuse_Orange_football</a>. He took command of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syracuse,_Sicily?lang=en'>Syracuse,_Sicily</a> troops, and in a series of battles defeated the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> forces, and prevented them from invading the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a>.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicias?lang=en'>Nicias</a> then sent word to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> asking for reinforcements. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Demosthenes?lang=en'>Demosthenes</a> was chosen and led another fleet to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily?lang=en'>Sicily</a>, joining his forces with those of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicias?lang=en'>Nicias</a>. More battles ensued and again, the Syracusans and their allies defeated the Athenians. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Demosthenes?lang=en'>Demosthenes</a> argued for a retreat to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, but <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicias?lang=en'>Nicias</a> at first refused. After additional setbacks, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicias?lang=en'>Nicias</a> seemed to agree to a retreat until a bad <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Omen?lang=en'>Omen</a>, in the form of a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moon?lang=en'>Moon</a> eclipse, delayed any withdrawal. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Delay?lang=en'>The_Delay</a> was costly and forced the Athenians into a major sea <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a> in the Great Harbor of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syracuse_Orange_football?lang=en'>Syracuse_Orange_football</a>. The Athenians were thoroughly defeated. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicias?lang=en'>Nicias</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Demosthenes?lang=en'>Demosthenes</a> marched their remaining forces inland in search of friendly allies. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syracuse,_Sicily?lang=en'>Syracuse,_Sicily</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>Cavalry</a> rode them down mercilessly, eventually killing or enslaving all who were left of the mighty <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> fleet.
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> were not content with simply sending aid to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily?lang=en'>Sicily</a>; they also resolved to take the war to the Athenians. On the advice of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alcibiades?lang=en'>Alcibiades</a>, they fortified <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decelea?lang=en'>Decelea</a>, near <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, and prevented the Athenians from making use of their land year round. The fortification of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decelea?lang=en'>Decelea</a> prevented the shipment of supplies overland to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, and forced all supplies to be brought in by sea at increased expense. Perhaps worst of all, the nearby silver mines were totally disrupted, with as many as 20,000 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> slaves freed by the Spartan <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decelea?lang=en'>Decelea</a>. With the treasury and emergency <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Military_reserve?lang=en'>Military_reserve</a> fund of 1,000 talents dwindling away, the Athenians were forced to demand even more tribute from her subject allies, further increasing tensions and the threat of further rebellion within the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire?lang=en'>Roman_Empire</a>.
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Corinth?lang=en'>Ancient_Corinth</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a>, and others in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_League?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_League</a> sent more reinforcements to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syracuse_Orange_football?lang=en'>Syracuse_Orange_football</a>, in the hopes of driving off the Athenians; but instead of withdrawing, the Athenians sent another hundred ships and another 5,000 troops to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily?lang=en'>Sicily</a>. Under <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gylippus?lang=en'>Gylippus</a>, the Syracusans and their allies were able to decisively defeat the Athenians on land; and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gylippus?lang=en'>Gylippus</a> encouraged the Syracusans to build a navy, which was able to defeat the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> fleet when they attempted to withdraw. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> army, attempting to withdraw overland to other, more friendly <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily?lang=en'>Sicily</a> cities, was divided and defeated; the entire <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> fleet was destroyed, and virtually the entire <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> army was sold off into <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Slavery?lang=en'>Slavery</a>.
<br>
<br>Following the defeat of the Athenians in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily?lang=en'>Sicily</a>, it was widely believed that the end of the Athenian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire?lang=en'>Roman_Empire</a> was at hand. Her treasury was nearly empty, her docks were depleted, and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flower?lang=en'>Flower</a> of her youth was dead or imprisoned in a foreign land. They overestimated the strength of their own empire and the beginning of the end was indeed imminent.
<br>
<br>Following the destruction of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicilian_Expedition?lang=en'>Sicilian_Expedition</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> encouraged the revolt of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>'s <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tribute?lang=en'>Tribute</a> allies, and indeed, much of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a> rose in revolt against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>. The Syracusans sent their fleet to the Peloponnesians, and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> decided to support the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> with money and ships. Revolt and faction threatened in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> itself.
<br>
<br>The Athenians managed to survive for several reasons. First, their foes were lacking in initiative. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syracuse_Orange_football?lang=en'>Syracuse_Orange_football</a> were slow to bring their fleets into the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegean_Sea?lang=en'>Aegean_Sea</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>'s other allies were also slow to furnish troops or ships. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a> states that rebelled expected protection, and many <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rejoined?lang=en'>Rejoined</a> the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> side. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Persians?lang=en'>The_Persians</a> were slow to furnish promised funds and ships, frustrating <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a> plans.
<br>
<br>At the start of the war, the Athenians had prudently put aside some money and 100 ships that were to be used only as a last resort.
<br>
<br>These ships were then released, and served as the core of the Athenians' fleet throughout the rest of the war. An <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oligarchy?lang=en'>Oligarchy</a> revolution occurred in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, in which a group of 400 seized power. A peace with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> might have been possible, but the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> fleet, now based on the island of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samos?lang=en'>Samos</a>, refused to accept the change. In 411 BC this fleet engaged the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> at the Battle of Syme. The fleet appointed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alcibiades?lang=en'>Alcibiades</a> their leader, and continued the war in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>'s name. Their opposition led to the reinstitution of a democratic government in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> within two years.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alcibiades?lang=en'>Alcibiades</a>, while condemned as a traitor, still carried weight in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>. He prevented the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> fleet from attacking <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>; instead, he helped restore <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athenian_democracy?lang=en'>Athenian_democracy</a> by more subtle pressure. He also persuaded the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> fleet to attack the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> at the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyzicus?lang=en'>Cyzicus</a> in 410. In the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a>, the Athenians obliterated the Spartan fleet, and succeeded in re-establishing the financial basis of the Athenian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire?lang=en'>Roman_Empire</a>.
<br>
<br>Between 410 and 406, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> won a continuous string of victories, and eventually recovered large portions of its empire. All of this was due, in no small part, to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alcibiades?lang=en'>Alcibiades</a>.
<br>
<br>Faction triumphed in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> following a minor Spartan victory by their skillful general <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lysander?lang=en'>Lysander</a> at the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naval_warfare?lang=en'>Naval_warfare</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Notium?lang=en'>Battle_of_Notium</a> in 406 BC. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alcibiades?lang=en'>Alcibiades</a> was not re-elected general by the Athenians and he exiled himself from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a>. He would never again lead Athenians in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> was then victorious at the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naval_warfare?lang=en'>Naval_warfare</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Arginusae?lang=en'>Battle_of_Arginusae</a>. The Spartan fleet under <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Callicratidas?lang=en'>Callicratidas</a> lost 70 ships and the Athenians lost 25 ships. But, due to bad weather, the Athenians were unable to rescue their stranded crews or to finish off the Spartan fleet. Despite their victory, these failures caused outrage in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> and led to a controversial trial. The trial resulted in the execution of six of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>’s top naval commanders. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>’s naval supremacy would now be challenged without several of its most able military leaders and a demoralized navy.
<br>
<br>Unlike some of his predecessors the new Spartan general, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lysander?lang=en'>Lysander</a>, was not a member of the Spartan royal families and was also <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Formidable-class_frigate?lang=en'>Formidable-class_frigate</a> in naval strategy; he was an artful <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diplomacy?lang=en'>Diplomacy</a>, who had even cultivated good personal relationships with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> prince <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Younger?lang=en'>Cyrus_the_Younger</a>, the son of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_II?lang=en'>Darius_II</a>. Seizing its opportunity, the Spartan fleet sailed at once to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dardanelles?lang=en'>Dardanelles</a>, the source of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>' grain. Threatened with starvation, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> fleet had no choice but to follow. Through cunning strategy, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lysander?lang=en'>Lysander</a> totally defeated the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> fleet, in 405 BC, at the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Aegospotami?lang=en'>Battle_of_Aegospotami</a>, destroying 168 ships and capturing some three or four thousand <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> sailors. Only 12 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> ships escaped, and several of these sailed to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyprus?lang=en'>Cyprus</a>, carrying the "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strategos?lang=en'>Strategos</a>" (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/General_officer?lang=en'>General_officer</a>) <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conon?lang=en'>Conon</a>, who was anxious not to face the judgment of the Assembly.
<br>
<br>Facing starvation and disease from the prolonged <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Siege?lang=en'>Siege</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> surrendered in 404 BC, and its allies soon surrendered as well. The democrats at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samos?lang=en'>Samos</a>, loyal to the bitter last, held on slightly longer, and were allowed to flee with their lives. The surrender stripped <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> of its walls, its fleet, and all of its overseas possessions. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia?lang=en'>Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia</a> demanded that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> should be destroyed and all its citizens should be enslaved. However, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> announced their refusal to destroy a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> that had done a good service at a time of greatest danger to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>, and took <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> into their own system. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> was "to have the same friends and enemies" as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>.[22]
<br>
<br>The overall effect of the war in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> proper was to substitute a Spartan empire for an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> one. After the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Aegospotami?lang=en'>Battle_of_Aegospotami</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> took over the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Delian_League</a> and kept all of its tribute revenues for itself; <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>'s allies, who had made greater sacrifices for the war effort than had <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>, got nothing.[1]
<br>
<br>For a short period of time, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> was ruled by the "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thirty_Tyrants?lang=en'>Thirty_Tyrants</a>", and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athenian_democracy?lang=en'>Athenian_democracy</a> was suspended. This was a reactionary regime set up by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>. In 403 BC, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oligarchy?lang=en'>Oligarchy</a> were overthrown and a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athenian_democracy?lang=en'>Athenian_democracy</a> was restored by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrasybulus?lang=en'>Thrasybulus</a>.
<br>
<br>Although the power of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> was broken, it made something of a recovery as a result of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinthian_War?lang=en'>Corinthian_War</a> and continued to play an active role in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> politics. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> was later humbled by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia?lang=en'>Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia</a> at the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Leuctra?lang=en'>Battle_of_Leuctra</a> in 371 BC, but the rivalry between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> was brought to an end a few decades later when <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_II_of_Macedon?lang=en'>Philip_II_of_Macedon</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Macedonia?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Macedonia</a> conquered all of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> except <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>
