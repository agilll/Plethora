Popular culture has been kind to the historical episode of the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, but with romanticized anecdotes intertwined between the actual events that took place before and during the particular military encounter. One apt example would <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pertain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pertain</b></span> to King <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> himself, who was probably closer to the age of 60 at the time of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, as opposed to what <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hollywood</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cinema_of_the_United_States</b></span> would make us believe (by contrast, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> was only 38-years old at the time of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>). So without further <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ado</span> <span style='color: green'><b>ADO_Den_Haag</b></span>, let us try to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sift</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Scale-invariant_feature_transform</b></span> some of the facts from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>fiction</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Fiction</b></span>, and have a gander at the 10 things one should know about the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> – a momentous episode of history that stands testament to the importance of tactics and bravery in war.
<br>
<br>While history is not favorable to the ancient <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> when it comes to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> wars, it should be noted that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> had quite a reputable record against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> in battles prior to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> episode in 490 BC. In that regard, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> were not able to stop the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> juggernaut in the four clashes out of five that took place in open-land during the preceding <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>. The fifth clash was a chaotic affair with a night-time ambush on the part of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.
<br>
<br>But beyond just the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>numbers game</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Numbers_game</b></span>, it was the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> combined-arms style of mass combat that allowed them to regularly triumph over the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> armies. To that end, the ‘flexible’ <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> tended to prefer <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>archery</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archery</b></span> over solid formations of infantrymen locking their shields. Furthermore, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenids</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> also utilized their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> for flanking and even at times as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>shock troops</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Shock_troops</b></span> to disperse their foes – as evidenced by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>final battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>ROH_Final_Battle</b></span> of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> at Malene that caused the ‘<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> to flee’ due to a last moment <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> charge (according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>).
<br>
<br>However the previous encounters were mainly fought by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Anatolian Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ottoman_Greeks</b></span>. The ‘mainland’ <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> on the other side not only emphasized hoplite-based warfare but rather took the tactical scope of ‘shoulder-to-shoulder’ combat to a whole new level of organization and discipline. According to much impressed <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>, at the commencement of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartan army</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> officers grouped the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> and their lines started moving forward (with some wearing wreaths), while the king began to sing one of many marching-songs composed by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tyrtaios</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrtaeus</b></span>. He was complemented by pipers who played the familiar tune, thus serving as a powerful auditory accompaniment to the progressing <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartan army</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Interestingly, as with many <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> customs, there might have been a practical side underneath this seemingly religious veneer. To that end, the songs and their tunes kept the marching line in order, which entailed a major battlefield tactic – since <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> warfare generally involved closing in with the enemy with a solid, unbroken line. This incredible auditory scope ended in a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>crescendo</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dynamics_(music)</b></span> with the collective (yet sacred) war-cry of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>paean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Paean</b></span>, a military custom that was <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dorian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dorians</b></span> in origin. And finally, if the wreaths and singing didn’t unnerve the enemy, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> also demonstrated their penchant for keeping up their own morale, especially since a massed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> charge was a chaotic and brutal affair (and thus most other armies broke even before the rigorous impact). As <span style='color: blue'><b>Xenophon</b></span>, in spite of being an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, heaped his praise on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> by calling them – “the only true craftsmen in matters of war”.
<br>
<br>And while the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> had their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> had their archers – with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>bow</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bow_and_arrow</b></span> being the national arm of the ancient Achaemenid <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span>. As a matter of fact, even some of the regular infantrymen, armed with short spears and double-edged daggers, carried their bows and fair share of arrows in a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>gorytos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gorytos</b></span>, a case that housed both the weapon and the projectiles. As for the dedicated <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> archers, they probably carried composite bows that were rather large by contemporary standards. According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Xenophon</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> archers even outranged the Cretans, who were considered as specialists in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>archery</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archery</b></span> from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> domain. And beyond just the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>bow</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bow_and_arrow</b></span> itself, much of the improved shooting probably had to do with the better <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>archery</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archery</b></span> techniques and the lighter arrows preferred by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Interestingly enough, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> also had the advantage in their ‘archers’ of a different kind. That is because the gold <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>daric</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persian_daric</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>coin</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Money</b></span> (dareikos in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>) was popularly referred to as the ‘<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>archer</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bow_and_arrow</b></span>’ by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> – since the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>currency</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Currency</b></span> depicted the image of a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> royal armed and ready to shoot his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>bow</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bow_and_arrow</b></span>. And thus many of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> Great Kings could boast how he could conquer <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> with his archers, with a possible <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pun</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pun</b></span> in the offering.
<br>
<br>The ancient <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> almost had an obsession with the number ‘thousand’, and as such their regiments were theoretically divided into thousand men known as hazarabam (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hazara</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hazaras</b></span> denoting thousand). The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>decimal system</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Decimal</b></span> was also upheld when ten such regiments were combined to form a division (baivarabam) of 10,000 men. The so-called ‘<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Immortals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Immortality</b></span>’ or Amrtaka (in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Old Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persian_language</b></span>) were the chosen baivarabam of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> king, and their scope of ‘<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>immortality</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Immortality</b></span>’ seemingly stemmed from the their constant number – which was always kept at 10,000 (according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>). In other words, the casualties in this elite division might have been replaced as soon as possible from the best candidates from other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> baivarabam. As <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> goes on to describe these <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athanatoi</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Immortals_(Byzantine_Empire)</b></span> (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Immortals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Immortality</b></span>) in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> (480 BC) –
<br>
<br>…a body of picked <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> under the leadership of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hydarnes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hydarnes_II</b></span>, the son of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hydarnes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hydarnes_II</b></span>. This corps was known as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Immortals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Immortality</b></span>, because it was invariably kept up to strength; if a man was killed or fell sick, the vacancy he left was at once filled, so that the total strength of the corps was never less – and never more – than ten thousand.
<br>
<br>Of all the troops in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army, the native <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were not only the best but also the most magnificently equipped; their dress and armor I have mentioned already, but I should add that every man glittered with the gold which he carried about his person in unlimited quantity. They were accompanied, moreover, by covered carriages full of their women and servants, all elaborately fitted out. Special food, separate from that of the rest of the army, was brought along for them on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dromedaries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dromedary</b></span> and mules.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historian further mentions their rich attire –
<br>
<br>The dress of these troops consisted of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tiara</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tiara</b></span>, or soft felt <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hat</b></span>, embroidered <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tunic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tunic</b></span> with sleeves, a coat of mail looking like the scales of a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>fish</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Fish</b></span>, and trousers; for arms they carried light wicker shields, quivers slung below them, short spears, powerful bows with cane arrows, and short swords swinging from belts beside the right thigh.
<br>As can be comprehended from such accounts, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian Immortals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Immortals_(Achaemenid_Empire)</b></span> were probably very different from the oddly ‘sinister’ manner in which they were depicted in the movie 300. As a matter of fact, such elite divisions tended to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>flaunt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Flaunt</b></span> their vibrant and ritzy uniforms and armaments – as is evident from their accounts of carrying spears with golden pomegranates, silver pomegranates and even golden apples. The latter mentioned spears were carried by the king’s own bodyguard unit of 1,000 men – known as arstibara, nicknamed as the ‘Applebearers’.
<br>
<br>The most popular misconception about the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> probably relates to the numbers fielded in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>. In fact, in many corners of popular culture, the encounter is often depicted as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>300 Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span> (aided by their rag-tag group of allies) versus over a million <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. These numbers however are without a shred of doubt exaggerations based on flawed historical accounts, modern-day <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pop culture</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Popular_culture</b></span> sensationalism and of course <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>romanticism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Romanticism</b></span>. In fact, during the period (circa 480 BC), <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> alone could have fielded over 8,000 of its free adult citizens as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>. But historically they could not bring forth their entire army at the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> due to religious observances (like the feast of <span style='color: blue'><b>Apollo</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Karneia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Carnea</b></span>) and the panhellenic <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympic Games</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Olympic_Games</b></span>. And while these reasons may seem bizarre to our modern sensibility, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ancient Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> formulated strict rules when it came to religious activities – so much so that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> didn’t even aid the Athenians (in time) during the momentous Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, ten years before <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>.
<br>
<br>This brings us to the question – how many men did each side have in this incredible encounter? Well interestingly enough, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> – the man who claimed that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> forces numbered over a million troops, clarified how the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> side at least had 5,200 men (as opposed to only <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>300 Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span>). The figure included the over thousand <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>perioikoi</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Perioeci</b></span> (the free yet non-citizens of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>), Mantineans, Tegeans, Arcadians, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Corinth</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thespians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thespiae</b></span> and even <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thebes,_Greece</b></span> (who probably numbered over 400), along with groups of other Peloponnesians. Modern historians also add the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helots</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span> to this array of forces, thus bringing the total number of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> probably over 7,000 men.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> on the other hand, while undoubtedly having their numerical superiority, would have had logistical constraints to even field half-a-million men, considering the size of their fleet. To that end, modern scholarship suggests that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> could have carried forth around 260,000 men in their 1,300 triremes – but only a percentage of them were actual soldiers, with others serving the duties of oarsmen, baggage carriers and camp followers. To summarize, the plausible figure range for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army at the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> was somewhere between 80,000 – 100,000 men.
<br>
<br>Another popular misconception (though more valid) about the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> relates to how <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> made his last stand in the encounter. And while this statement holds true for the final day of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, the initial decision made by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> and his commanders to hold the pass was probably more of a logical tactic than just a noble warrior’s duty. The very position of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> reveals the ‘<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>force-multiplier</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Force_multiplication</b></span>’ strategy of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, with the defensive area being only around 15 m (or 49 ft) in width, and governing a location that was nearby to a smaller <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mountain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mountain_warfare</b></span> passage on its left and sea to its right.
<br>
<br>In fact, part of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>’ strategy to defend his position at what is known as the ‘Middle Gate’ was fueled by the presence of an existing (though dilapidated) wall that was built by the local Phokians. And while the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> forces were busy repairing the makeshift fortification, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> also took heed of many of the flanking routes that bypassed the gates. One of these treacherous pathways, known as the Anopaia path, was actually guarded by around 1,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phokian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis_(ancient_region)</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> under the directive of the Spartan king.
<br>
<br>It is no hidden secret that the sheer level of training and high morale of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> allowed to them to be steadfast in the face of an overwhelming <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> force in the first day of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>. The encounter didn’t prove be successful for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>, with the heavy defeat rather exacerbated by the constricted landscape of the pass (which countered the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> advantage in numbers). And <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, while being vague on casualty figures, talked about how the longer spears of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> were actually better suited to the task of engaging the enemy than the shorter spears of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> infantrymen. We are also told that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fought in relays, with contingents allowed to take break from the front-line – thus making the defense more effective with fresher batches of men.
<br>
<br>However, while much has been said about Spartan ‘obstinacy’ in the face of imminent danger, one should also understand that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> among most <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> comprehended the practicality of warfare. In many ways, their army was the closest to what can be termed as a professional military force in the contemporary ancient world. To that end, an often overlooked ploy in the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> related to how the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> not only held their positions, but also made organized retreats, to lure the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> into tighter terrains. And once a large enemy force was cut off from the main body, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> turned around and used their superior melee skills (along with the element of surprise) to destroy them in a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>piecemeal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Piecemeal_(Gilbert_Benson)</b></span> fashion. This tactic of feigning retreats also didn’t allow the famed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> archers to focus on stationary targets of massed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The second day of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> also played out in a similar fashion like its previous day, with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> unable to make any significant breakthrough. But then came the famous episode of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ephialtes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephialtes_of_Trachis</b></span> and how he presented himself before the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> command as a guide for the ‘secret’ path that would bypass the main <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> position and catch them unawares at the rear. But as we fleetingly mentioned before, once again contrary to popular notions, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> was already aware of the existence of such a path. In fact, this very passage, known as the Anopaia path, was actually guarded by the local <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phokian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis_(ancient_region)</b></span> contingent that had around a thousand men.
<br>
<br>But unfortunately for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> sent their elite <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Immortals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Immortality</b></span> (presumably guided by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ephialtes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephialtes_of_Trachis</b></span>), who probably set out in their full numbers to make a deciding impact in the conflict. And by the dawn of the third day, they reached the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phokian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis_(ancient_region)</b></span> positions, with both sides rather surprised by each others presence. And while the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phokian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis_(ancient_region)</b></span> citizen-militia were known for their competent vigilance over the local lands (at least under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> control), they were simply no match for the ‘mixed-tactics’ espoused by the heavily-trained <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Immortals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Immortality</b></span>. In the following encounter, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Immortals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Immortality</b></span> quickly overwhelmed their opponents by focused arrow-fire volleys. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phokian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis_(ancient_region)</b></span> militias rapidly retreated to the higher grounds, and then most of them pleaded for their lives to the arriving <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> forces. Interestingly enough, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Immortals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Immortality</b></span>, instead of dallying with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phokian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis_(ancient_region)</b></span> forces, continued their calculated advance into the rear part of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> positions, thus ultimately turning the tide of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>.
<br>
<br>After <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> heard the news of their vulnerable position in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, he once again resorted to a tactical decision that ironically entailed making a last stand. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>In essence</span> <span style='color: green'><b>In_Essence</b></span>, while later tales extolled the virtues of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>defiance</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Defiance_(TV_series)</b></span> and braveness in the face of imminent death (and justifiably so), <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> and his men stayed behind not for their posthumous praises, but for covering a significant part of the army that had over 5,000 men. To that end, when it comes to strategy, the overall retreat of the entire <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army, while being one of the available options, wouldn’t have been the best course of action since <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> by this time could have easily overtaken them and cut them off in a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>piecemeal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Piecemeal_(Gilbert_Benson)</b></span> manner.
<br>
<br>Simply put, to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>, it was the matter of saving a significant part of the defending force by rear-guard action or making a prolonged last stand with the entire army that would have caused greater number of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> casualties. Suffice it to say, he bravely (and wisely) chose the former. And this allowed the majority of the defending <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> soldiers to escape from the clutches of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>.
<br>
<br>But once again, as opposed to popular notions, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> did not make his last stand with just his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>300 Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span>. They were probably aided by their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helot</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span> attendants (possibly numbering over 300), along with around 700 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thespians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thespiae</b></span> and 400 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thebes,_Greece</b></span> (who, according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> were held against their will, though practicality of warfare suggests otherwise). And instead of occupying the narrow pass, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> ordered his assembled rear-guard to advance to a broader area, knowing well that their previously guarded position was now vulnerable to the approaching <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Immortals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Immortality</b></span> from behind. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> made their characteristic slow advance with shield-walls, singing of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>paean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Paean</b></span> hymns and ritual sacrifices.
<br>
<br>Interestingly enough, the orthodox method of marching was soon done with, as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> arrows began to fall among the ranks. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> comprehending the urgency of the situation, ordered his men to sprint along the last few yards and quickly close the gap between the enemy and themselves, thus once again denying the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> archers to have a go at relatively immobile targets. And once the armies met, a furious clash ensued, which resulted in even greater <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> casualties (according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>). But unfortunately for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> met his demise in the chaotic melee engagement, and his guards valiantly defended the fallen body of their king to the last man. Finally the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> decided to fall back to the narrow pass, and made their stand on a hillock (with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>broken spears</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Broken_Spears</b></span> and swords), though the remaining <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thebes,_Greece</b></span> possibly endeavored to surrender themselves and their weapons to the enemy. Thus ended the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, resulting in a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pyrrhic victory</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pyrrhic_victory</b></span> for the invading <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>In essence</span> <span style='color: green'><b>In_Essence</b></span>, the last stand was not just about the heroics of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>300 Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span>, but rather encompassed the gutsy feat of over a thousand <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> that included both free-men <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> and lightly armed slaves. In fact, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> even grudgingly mentioned the corpses of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helots</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span>
