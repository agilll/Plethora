<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> was one of the most important <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> city-states throughout the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archaic_Greece?lang=en'>Archaic</a> and Classical periods and was famous for its military prowess. The professional and well-trained Spartan <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>hoplites</a> with their distinctive red cloaks, long hair, and lambda-emblazoned shields were probably the best and most feared fighters in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>, fighting with distinction at such key battles as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plataea?lang=en'>Plataea</a> in the early 5th century <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> was also in constant rivalry with the other major <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> cities of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a> and became involved in two protracted and hugely damaging conflicts, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian Wars</a> of the mid- to late 5th century <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinthian</a> Wars of in the early 4th century <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>.   
<br>
<br>In <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_mythology?lang=en'>Greek mythology</a> the founder of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> was <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Lacedaemon</a>, a son of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zeus?lang=en'>Zeus</a>, who gave his name to the region and his wife’s name to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> was also an important member of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> force which participated in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trojan_War?lang=en'>Trojan War</a>. Indeed, the Spartan king <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Menelaus?lang=en'>Menelaos</a> instigated the war after the Trojan prince <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris?lang=en'>Paris</a> abducted his wife Helen, offered to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris?lang=en'>Paris</a> by the goddess <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aphrodite?lang=en'>Aphrodite</a> as a prize for choosing her in a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beauty_pageant?lang=en'>beauty contest</a> with fellow goddesses <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athena?lang=en'>Athena</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hera?lang=en'>Hera</a>. Helen was said to have been the most beautiful woman in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> and Spartan women in general enjoyed a reputation not only for good looks but also spirited independence.   
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> was located in the fertile <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eurotas?lang=en'>Eurotas</a> valley of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Laconia?lang=en'>Laconia</a> in the southeast <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnese?lang=en'>Peloponnese</a>. The area was first settled in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neolithic?lang=en'>Neolithic</a> period and an important settlement developed in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bronze_Age?lang=en'>Bronze Age</a>. Archaeological evidence, however, suggests that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> itself was a new settlement created from the 10th century <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>.
<br>
<br>In the late 8th century <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> subjugated most of neighbouring <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Messenia?lang=en'>Messenia</a> and its population was made to serve Spartan interests. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> thus came to control some 8,500 km² of territory making the polis or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polis?lang=en'>city-state</a> the largest in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> and a major player in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> politics. The conquered peoples of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Messenia?lang=en'>Messenia</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Laconia?lang=en'>Laconia</a>, known as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Perioeci?lang=en'>perioikoi</a>, had no political rights in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> and were often made to serve with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan army</a>. A second and lower social group was the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helots?lang=en'>helots</a>, semi-enslaved agricultural labourers who lived on Spartan-owned estates. Intermediary between the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helots?lang=en'>helots</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Perioeci?lang=en'>perioikoi</a> were the liberated <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helots?lang=en'>helots</a> or neodamōdeis. Spartan citizens did not indulge in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Agriculture?lang=en'>farming</a> activities themselves but devoted their time to military training, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hunter-gatherer?lang=en'>hunting</a>, war, and politics. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helots?lang=en'>helots</a> could keep a percentage of the produce they cultivated, but they were also regularly purged to keep them firmly in their social place and they could also be conscripted into military duties in times of war.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Relationship?lang=en'>The relationship</a> between citizens and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helots?lang=en'>helots</a> was an uneasy one and there were sometimes uprisings, notably in the 7th century <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> which contributed to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>’s defeat to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Argos?lang=en'>Argos</a> at Hysiae in 669 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> gained revenge on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Argos?lang=en'>Argos</a> in c. 545 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> but then lost a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tegea?lang=en'>Tegea</a> shortly after. This regional instability brought about the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_League?lang=en'>Peloponnesian League</a> (c. 505 to 365 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>) which was a grouping of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elis?lang=en'>Elis</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tegea?lang=en'>Tegea</a>, and other states (but never <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Argos?lang=en'>Argos</a>), where each member swore to have the same enemies and allies as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>. Membership of the League did not necessitate the paying of tribute to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> but rather the provision of troops. The League would allow <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> to establish <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_hegemony?lang=en'>hegemony</a> over and dominate the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnese?lang=en'>Peloponnese</a> until the 4th century <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>. In addition to local politics, from the 6th century <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> began to broaden her horizons by, for example, creating an alliance with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Croesus?lang=en'>Croesus</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lydia?lang=en'>Lydia</a> and sending an expedition against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polycrates?lang=en'>Polycrates</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samos?lang=en'>Samos</a> in c. 525 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>, under <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cleomenes_I?lang=en'>Cleomenes</a> (c. 520-490 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>), overthrew the tyrants of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> but the resulting <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athenian_democracy?lang=en'>democracy</a> put a stop to any Spartan ambitions in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> was, however, an ally with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> in the defence of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> against the invasion of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>king Xerxes</a>, and fought with distinction at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> in 480 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> and at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plataea?lang=en'>Plataea</a> one year later. From 480 to 460 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> regional rivalries and revolts by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helots?lang=en'>helots</a> damaged <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> and worse were to follow when rivalry with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> developed into the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian Wars</a> from c. 460 to 446 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> and again from 431 to 404 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>. The long wars were damaging to both sides but <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>, with some <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> help, finally won the conflict when <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lysander?lang=en'>Lysander</a> destroyed the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athenian</a> fleet at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Aegospotami?lang=en'>Aegospotami</a> in 405 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>’s position as the number one <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polis?lang=en'>city-state</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>, though, was to be short-lived.
<br>
<br>Continued Spartan ambitions in central and northern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Asia Minor</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily?lang=en'>Sicily</a> once again dragged the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> into another protracted conflict, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinthian</a> Wars with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia?lang=en'>Thebes</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persia</a> from 396 to 387 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>. The result of the conflict was the ‘King’s Peace’ where <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> ceded her empire (for which she in any case lacked the necessary bureaucratic apparatus to manage properly) to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> control but <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> was left to dominate <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>. However, trying to crush <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia?lang=en'>Thebes</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> lost the crucial <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Leuctra?lang=en'>Leuctra</a> in 371 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> against the brilliant <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theban_hegemony?lang=en'>Theban</a> general <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epaminondas?lang=en'>Epaminondas</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia?lang=en'>Thebes</a> then annexed parts of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Messenia?lang=en'>Messenia</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> became thereafter only a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Second-rate?lang=en'>second-rate</a> power.
<br>
<br>After briefly challenging <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Macedonians?lang=en'>Macedonian</a> control in the 3rd century <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> and being besieged by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pyrrhus_of_Epirus?lang=en'>Pyrrhus</a> in 272 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> never regained her former glory and she was compelled to join the Achaean <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Confederation?lang=en'>Confederacy</a> in 195 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>. Under Roman control <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> was permitted to leave the confederacy in 147 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> which prompted the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaean_War?lang=en'>Achaean War</a>. However, as a free <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> in the Roman world things did improve for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>, and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> enjoyed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Good_Relations?lang=en'>good relations</a> with her conquerors but the end finally came for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> in 396 CE when the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Visigoths?lang=en'>Visigoth</a> king <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alaric_I?lang=en'>Alaric</a> sacked the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a>.
<br>
<br>The Spartan political system was unusual in that it had two hereditary kings from two separate families. These monarchs were particularly powerful when one of them led the army on campaign. The kings were also priests of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zeus?lang=en'>Zeus</a> and they sat on the council of elders known as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gerousia?lang=en'>gerousia</a>. This body consisted of 28 over-60 years of age males who held the position for life. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gerousia?lang=en'>gerousia</a> led the citizen assembly, probably proposing issues on which to vote and it was also the highest court in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>. The assembly (Ekklēsia) met once a month and was open to all citizens who voted by the simple method of shouting. There was also an executive committee of five <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephor?lang=en'>ephors</a> (ephoroi) chosen by lot from the citizen body, able only to serve for a maximum of one year and who were ineligible for future office. Two of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephor?lang=en'>ephors</a> also accompanied one of the kings when on campaign. Just how these different political elements interacted is not known for certain but clearly a degree of consensus was necessary for the state apparatus to function. It may also explain <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>’s reputation as being a conservative state slow to make decisions in foreign policy.  
<br>
<br>Like all <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> societies <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> was dominated by male citizens and the most powerful of those came from a select group of families. These were the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Landed_nobility?lang=en'>landed aristocracy</a>, and following reforms credited to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lycurgus_of_Sparta?lang=en'>Lycurgus</a> in the 6th century <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> (or even earlier), citizens could not indulge in agricultural activities - this was the lot of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helots?lang=en'>helots</a> - but they had to devote themselves to athletic and military training and politics. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helots?lang=en'>Helots</a> could not own property and so could not rise to become full-citizens, and this lack of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Social_mobility?lang=en'>social mobility</a> would come back to haunt <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> in later centuries.  Reduced by constant wars in the 5th and 4th centuries <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>, the Spartan <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>hoplites</a> (homoioi) became dangerously small in number (8,000 in 490 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> to 700 in 371 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>), so much so, that non-Spartiate soldiers had to be enlisted and their loyalty and interest in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>’s ambitions was questionable.
<br>
<br>Women in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> had a better lot than in other <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> city-states. In <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> they could own property which they often gained through <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dowry?lang=en'>dowries</a> and inheritances. In fact, women became amongst the richest members of society, as their men were killed in the many wars, and eventually controlled 2/5th of Spartan land. In addition, Spartan women could also move around with reasonable freedom, they could enjoy athletics (done in the nude like men), and even drink <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wine?lang=en'>wine</a>. All of these freedoms would have been unacceptable in other <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polis?lang=en'>poleis</a>.  
<br>
<br>There were foreigners (xenoi) in Spartan society but these were not as welcome as in other city-states, and those that did live in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> were sometimes forcibly expelled by their overly suspicious and at times positively paranoid hosts.
<br>
<br>For all Spartan citizens there was a strong emphasis on military training and frugal living in communal mess halls where simple food such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barley?lang=en'>barley</a> meal, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cheese?lang=en'>cheese</a>, figs and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wine?lang=en'>wine</a> were the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norm_(social)?lang=en'>norm</a>. From the age of seven, males had a militaristic upbringing known as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Agoge?lang=en'>agōgē</a> where they were separated into age groups and lived in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barracks?lang=en'>barracks</a>. These youths pursued rigorous athletic and military training which became even more demanding from the age of 20, when they joined common mess halls (syssition) where they often formed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homosexuality?lang=en'>homoerotic</a> relations with older, more experienced citizens. This tough training resulted in a professional <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>hoplite</a> army capable of relatively sophisticated <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> manoeuvres and made them feared throughout <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>, a fact perhaps evidenced by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>’s notable lack of fortifications for most of its history.
<br>
<br>
<br>A peculiar feature of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> and their military was the great importance given to matters of religion. As <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> put it, they ‘considered the things of the gods more weighty than the things of men’. Pre- and post-battle sacrifices were a common feature of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> warfare in general but the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan army</a> took things one step further and sacrificed before crossing rivers, for example, and even withheld from mobilising the army if an important religious festival was ongoing. Famous episodes where the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> put religion above warfare and even national crisis were <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Marathon</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> during the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greco-Persian_Wars?lang=en'>Persian Wars</a>. In the former <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> they arrived too late to participate and in the latter mobilised only a token force as they felt compelled to first celebrate the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carnea?lang=en'>Karneia</a> festival in honour of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo?lang=en'>Apollo</a>.   
<br>
<br>The Spartan <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>hoplite</a> army, however, showed the rest of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> the way forward towards a greater military professionalism and considering the iconic image of fearless and disciplined <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>hoplites</a> with red cloaks and lambda-emblazoned shields, for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>, admiring <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Republic?lang=en'>Romans</a> and even 21st century film-goers, this is <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>
