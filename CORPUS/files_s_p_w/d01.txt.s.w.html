The Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span>  was fought between an alliance of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states, led by King <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, and the Persian <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> over the course of three days, during the second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. It took place simultaneously with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>naval battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naval_warfare</b></span> at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span>, in August or September 480 BC, at the narrow coastal pass of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span> (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Hot Gates</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Hot_Gates</b></span>). The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion was a delayed response to the defeat of the first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, which had been ended by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> victory at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> in 490 BC. By 480 BC <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> had amassed a huge army and navy, and set out to conquer all of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> politician and general <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> had proposed that the allied <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> block the advance of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army at the pass of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span>, and simultaneously block the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> navy at the Straits of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span>.
<br>
<br>A <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> force of approximately 7,000 men marched north to block the pass in the middle of 480 BC. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army, alleged by the ancient sources to have numbered over one million, but today considered to have been much smaller (various figures are given by scholars, ranging between about 100,000 and 150,000), arrived at the pass in late August or early September. The vastly outnumbered <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> held off the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> for seven days (including three of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>) before the rear-guard was annihilated in one of history's most famous last stands. During two full days of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, the small force led by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> blocked the only road by which the massive <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army could pass. After the second day, a local resident named <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ephialtes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephialtes_of_Trachis</b></span> betrayed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> by revealing that a small path led behind the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_language</b></span> lines. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>, aware that his force was being outflanked, dismissed the bulk of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_language</b></span> army and remained to guard their retreat with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>300 Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span>, 700 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thespians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thespiae</b></span>, and 400 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thebes,_Greece</b></span>, fighting to the death.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> was in command of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek Navy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hellenic_Navy</b></span> at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span> when he received news that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> had taken the pass at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>. Since the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_language</b></span> strategy required both <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span> to be held, given their losses, it was decided to withdraw to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> overran <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span> and then captured the evacuated <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_language</b></span> fleet—seeking a decisive victory over the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> armada—attacked and defeated the invaders at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span> in late 480 BC. Wary of being trapped in <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> withdrew with much of his army to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> (losing most to starvation and disease), leaving <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> to attempt to complete the conquest of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. However, the following year saw a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army decisively defeat the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> at the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>, thereby ending the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion.
<br>
<br>Both ancient and modern writers have used the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> as an example of the power of a patriotic army defending its native soil. The performance of the defenders is also used as an example of the advantages of training, equipment, and good use of terrain as force multipliers and has become a symbol of courage against overwhelming odds.
<br>
<br>The primary source for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> is the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Sicilian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Sicilian</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Diodorus Siculus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Diodorus_Siculus</b></span>, writing in the 1st century BC in his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bibliotheca historica</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bibliotheca_historica</b></span>, also provides an account of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, partially derived from the earlier <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephorus</b></span>. This account is fairly consistent with <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Ctesias</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cnidus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Knidos</b></span>, and are referred to by other authors, as in <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeschylus</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Archaeological evidence, such as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Serpent Column</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Serpent_Column</b></span> (now in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hippodrome</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hippodrome_of_Constantinople</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Constantinople</b></span>), also supports some of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' specific claims. George B. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Grundy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sydney_Grundy</b></span> was the first modern historian to do a thorough topographical survey of the narrow pass at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, and to the extent that modern accounts of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> differ from <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' they usually follow <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Grundy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sydney_Grundy</b></span>'s. For example, the military strategist <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sir Basil Henry Liddell Hart</span> <span style='color: green'><b>B._H._Liddell_Hart</b></span> defers to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Grundy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sydney_Grundy</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Grundy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sydney_Grundy</b></span> also explored <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> and wrote a treatise on that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>.
<br>
<br>On the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> itself, two principal sources, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Simonides</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Simonides_of_Ceos</b></span>' accounts, survive. In fact, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' account of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, in Book VII of his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, is such an important source that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Paul Cartledge</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Paul_Cartledge</b></span> wrote: we either write a history of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> with <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, or not at all. Also surviving is an epitome of the account of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ctesias</b></span>, by the eighth-century Byzantine Photias, though this is almost worse than useless, missing key events in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> such as the betrayal of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ephialtes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephialtes_of_Trachis</b></span>, and the account of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Diodorus Siculus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Diodorus_Siculus</b></span> in his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Universal History</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Universal_history</b></span>. Diodorus' account seems to have been based on that of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephorus</b></span> and contains one significant deviation from <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' account: a supposed night attack against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> camp, of which modern scholars have tended to be skeptical.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> had encouraged the unsuccessful <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> against the Persian <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> in 499–494 BC. The Persian <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span> was still relatively young and prone to revolts amongst its subject peoples. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>, moreover, was a usurper and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> threatened the integrity of his empire, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> thus vowed to punish those involved, especially the Athenians, since he was sure that the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> would not go unpunished for their rebellion. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> also saw the opportunity to expand his empire into the fractious world of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ancient Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. A preliminary expedition under <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> in 492 BC, to secure the land approaches to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, re-conquered <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span> and forced <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span> to become a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>client kingdom</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Client_state</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>'s.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> sent emissaries to all the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states in 491 BC asking for a gift of earth and water as tokens of their submission to him. Having had a demonstration of his power the previous year, the majority of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities duly obliged. In <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, however, the ambassadors were put on trial and then executed by throwing them in a pit; in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, they were simply thrown down a well. This meant that <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> was also effectively at war with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> thus put together an amphibious task force under Datis and <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> in 490 BC, which attacked <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>, before receiving the submission of the other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cycladic Islands</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyclades</b></span>. The task force then moved on <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>, which it besieged and destroyed. Finally, it moved to attack <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, landing at the bay of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, where it was met by a heavily outnumbered <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> army. At the ensuing Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, the Athenians won a remarkable victory, which resulted in the withdrawal of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>, therefore, began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>; however, in 486 BC, his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> expedition. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> then died whilst preparing to march on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</b></span>, and the throne of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> passed to his son <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> crushed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemy_V_Epiphanes</b></span> and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. Since this was to be a full-scale invasion, it required long-term planning, stockpiling, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>conscription</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Conscription</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> decided that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> would be bridged to allow his army to cross to <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>, and that a canal should be dug across the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>isthmus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Isthmus_of_Corinth</b></span> of Mount <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mount_Athos</b></span> (rounding which <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>headland</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Headland</b></span>, a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC). These were both feats of exceptional ambition, which would have been beyond any other contemporary state. By early 480 BC, the preparations were complete, and the army which <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> had mustered at <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> marched towards <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>, crossing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> on two pontoon bridges. According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>' army was so large that, upon arriving at the banks of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Echeidorus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gallikos_(river)</b></span> River, his soldiers proceeded to drink it dry. In the face of such imposing numbers, many <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities capitulated to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> demand for a tribute of earth and water.
<br>
<br>The Athenians had also been preparing for war with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> since the mid-<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>480s BC</span> <span style='color: green'><b>480s_BC</b></span>, and in 482 BC the decision was taken, under the guidance of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> politician <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, to build a massive fleet of triremes that would be essential for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> to fight the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. However, the Athenians lacked the manpower to fight on both land and sea; therefore, combating the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> would require an alliance of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states. In 481 BC, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> sent ambassadors around <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> requesting earth and water but very deliberately omitting <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>. Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states. A congress of city-states met at <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>late autumn</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Late_Autumn_(1960_film)</b></span> of 481 BC, and a confederate alliance of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states was formed. It had the power to send envoys to request assistance and dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points, after joint consultation. This was remarkable for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>disjointed</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Disjointed</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> world, especially since many of the city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.
<br>
<br>The congress met again in the spring of 480 BC. A <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thessalian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thessaly</b></span> delegation suggested that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> could muster in the narrow Vale of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tempe</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vale_of_Tempe</b></span>, on the borders of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thessaly</b></span>, and thereby block <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>' advance. A force of 10,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> was dispatched to the Vale of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tempe</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vale_of_Tempe</b></span>, through which they believed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army would have to pass. However, once there, being warned by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> I of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span> that the vale could be bypassed through Sarantoporo Pass and that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>' army was overwhelming, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> retreated. Shortly afterwards, they received the news that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> had crossed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, therefore, suggested a second strategy to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>: the route to southern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> (<span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>) would require <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>' army to travel through the very narrow pass of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, which could easily be blocked by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>, despite the overwhelming numbers of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. Furthermore, to prevent the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> from bypassing <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> by sea, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and allied navies could block the straits of <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Congress</span> <span style='color: green'><b>United_States_Congress</b></span> adopted this dual-pronged strategy. However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span>, should it come to that, whilst the women and children of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> had been evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Troezen</b></span>.
<br>
<br>he <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army seems to have made slow progress through <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span>. News of the imminent <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> approach eventually reached <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> in August thanks to a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>spy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Espionage</b></span>. At this time of year the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>de facto</span> <span style='color: green'><b>De_facto</b></span> military leaders of the alliance, were celebrating the festival of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Carneia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Carnea</b></span>. During the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Carneia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Carnea</b></span>, military activity was forbidden by Spartan law; the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> had arrived too late at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> because of this requirement. It was also the time of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympic Games</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Olympic_Games</b></span>, and therefore the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympic truce</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Olympic_truce</b></span>, and thus it would have been doubly sacrilegious for the whole <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartan army</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> to march to war. On this occasion, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ephors</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephor</b></span> decided the urgency was sufficiently great to justify an advance expedition to block the pass, under one of its kings, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> took with him the 300 men of the royal bodyguard, the <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippeis</b></span>. This expedition was to try to gather as many other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> soldiers along the way as possible and to await the arrival of the main <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartan army</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The legend of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, as told by <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, has it that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> had consulted the <span style='color: blue'><b>Oracle</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Delphi</b></span> earlier in the year. The <span style='color: blue'><b>Oracle</b></span> is said to have made the following prophecy:
<br>
<br>O ye men who dwell in the streets of broad <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lacedaemon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sparta</b></span>!
<br>Honor the festival of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Carneia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Carnea</b></span>!! Otherwise,
<br>Either your glorious town shall be sacked by the children of <span style='color: blue'><b>Perseus</b></span>,
<br>Or, in exchange, must all through the whole <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Laconian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Laconia</b></span> country
<br>Mourn for the loss of a king, descendant of great <span style='color: blue'><b>Heracles</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> tells us that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>, in line with the prophecy, was convinced he was going to certain death since his forces were not adequate for a victory, and so he selected only <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Michigan_State_Spartans</b></span> with living sons.
<br>
<br>The Spartan force was reinforced en route to <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> by contingents from various cities and numbered more than 7,000 by the time it arrived at the pass. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> chose to camp at, and defend, the middle gate, the narrowest part of the pass of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, where the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phocians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis</b></span> had built a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>defensive wall</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Defensive_wall</b></span> some time before. News also reached <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>, from the nearby <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Trachis</b></span>, that there was a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mountain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mountain</b></span> track which could be used to outflank the pass of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> stationed 1,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phocians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis</b></span> on the heights to prevent such a manoeuvre.
<br>
<br>Finally, in mid-August, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army was sighted across the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Malian Gulf</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Malian_Gulf</b></span> approaching <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>. With the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army's arrival at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> held a council of war. Some Peloponnesians suggested withdrawal to the Isthmus of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinth</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Corinth</b></span> and blocking the passage to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phocians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Locrians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Locris</b></span>, whose states were located nearby, became indignant and advised defending <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> and sending for more help. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> calmed the panic and agreed to defend <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>. According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>, when one of the soldiers complained that, Because of the arrows of the barbarians it is impossible to see the sun, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> replied, Won't it be nice, then, if we shall have shade in which to fight them? <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> reports a similar comment, but attributes it to <span style='color: blue'><b>Dienekes</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> sent a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> emissary to negotiate with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> were offered their freedom, the title <span style='color: blue'><b>Friends</b></span> of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian People</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persian_people</b></span>, and the opportunity to re-settle on land better than that they possessed. When <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> refused these terms, the ambassador carried a written message by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>, asking him to Hand over your arms. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>' famous response to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> was Molṑn <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>labé</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Labé</b></span> (Μολὼν λαβέ - literally, having come, take them, but usually translated as come and take them). With the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> embassy returning empty-handed, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> became inevitable. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> delayed for four days, waiting for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> to disperse, before sending troops to attack them.
<br>
<br>The number of troops which <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> mustered for the second invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> has been the subject of endless dispute, most notably between ancient sources, which report very large numbers, and modern scholars, who surmise much smaller figures. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> claimed that there were, in total, 2.6 million military personnel, accompanied by an equivalent number of support personnel. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>poet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Poet</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Simonides</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Simonides_of_Ceos</b></span>, who was a near-contemporary, talks of four million; <span style='color: blue'><b>Ctesias</b></span> gave 800,000 as the total number of the army that was assembled by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Modern scholars tend to reject the figures given by <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> and other ancient sources as unrealistic, resulting from miscalculations or exaggerations on the part of the victors. Modern scholarly estimates are generally in the range 120,000–300,000. These estimates usually come from studying the logistical capabilities of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> in that era, the sustainability of their respective bases of operations, and the overall manpower constraints affecting them. Whatever the real numbers were, however, it is clear that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> was anxious to ensure a successful expedition by mustering an overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea. The number of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> troops present at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> is therefore as uncertain as the number for the total invasion force. For instance, it is unclear whether the whole <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army marched as far as <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, or whether <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> left garrisons in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Thessaly</b></span>.
<br>
<br>
<br>Diodorus suggests that there were 1,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lacedemonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Laconia</b></span> and 3,000 other Peloponnesians, totalling 4,000. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> agrees with this figure in one passage, quoting an inscription by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Simonides</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Simonides_of_Ceos</b></span> saying there were 4,000 Peloponnesians. However, elsewhere, in the passage summarized by the above table, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> tallies 3,100 Peloponnesians at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> before the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> also reports that at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>' public showing of the dead, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helots</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span> were also there for them to see, but he does not say how many or in what capacity they served. Thus, the difference between his two figures can be squared by supposing (without proof) that there were 900 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helots</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span> (three per Spartan) present at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>. If <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helots</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span> were present at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, there is no reason to doubt that they served in their traditional role as armed retainers to individual <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>. Alternatively, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' missing 900 troops might have been <span style='color: blue'><b>Perioeci</b></span>, and could therefore correspond to Diodorus' 1,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lacedemonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Laconia</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Further confusing the issue is Diodorus' ambiguity about whether his count of 1,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lacedemonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Laconia</b></span> included the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>300 Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span>. At one point he says: <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>, when he received the appointment, announced that only one thousand men should follow him on the campaign. However, he then says: There were, then, of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lacedaemonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sparta</b></span> one thousand, and with them three hundred <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartiates</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartiate</b></span>. It is therefore impossible to be clearer on this point.
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span>' account agrees with that of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> (whom he probably read) except that he gives the number of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Locrians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Locris</b></span>, which <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> declined to estimate. Residing in the direct path of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> advance, they gave all the fighting men they had - according to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span> 6,000 men - which added to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' 5,200 would have given a force of 11,200.
<br>
<br>Many modern historians, who usually consider <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> more reliable, add the 1,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lacedaemonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sparta</b></span> and the 900 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helots</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span> to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' 5,200 to obtain 7,100 or about 7,000 men as a standard number, neglecting Diodorus' Melians and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span>' <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Locrians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Locris</b></span>. However, this is only one approach, and many other combinations are plausible. Furthermore, the numbers changed later on in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> when most of the army retreated and only approximately 3,000 men remained (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>300 Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span>, 700 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thespians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thespiae</b></span>, 400 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thebes,_Greece</b></span>, possibly up to 900 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helots</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span>, and 1,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phocians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis</b></span> stationed above the pass, less the casualties sustained in the previous days).
<br>
<br>From a strategic point of view, by defending <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> were making the best possible use of their forces. As long as they could prevent a further <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> advance into <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, they had no need to seek a decisive <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> and could, thus, remain on the defensive. Moreover, by defending two constricted passages (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span>), the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>' inferior numbers became less of a factor. Conversely, for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> the problem of supplying such a large army meant they could not remain in the same place for very long. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span>, therefore, had to retreat or advance, and advancing required forcing the pass of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Tactically, the pass at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> was ideally suited to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> style of warfare. A <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> could block the narrow pass with ease, with no risk of being outflanked by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>. Moreover, in the pass, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> would have been very difficult to assault for the more lightly armed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> infantry. The major weak point for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> was the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mountain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mountain_warfare</b></span> track which led across the highland parallel to <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, that could allow their position to be outflanked. Although probably unsuitable for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>, this path could easily be traversed by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> infantry (many of whom were <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>versed</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Midazolam</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mountain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mountain_warfare</b></span> warfare). <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> was made aware of this path by local people from <span style='color: blue'><b>Trachis</b></span>, and he positioned a detachment of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phocian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis</b></span> troops there in order to block this route.
<br>
<br>It is often claimed that at the time, the pass of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> consisted of a track along the shore of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Malian Gulf</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Malian_Gulf</b></span> so narrow that only one <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>chariot</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chariot</b></span> could pass through at a time. In fact, as noted below, the pass was <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>100 metres</span> <span style='color: green'><b>100_metres</b></span> wide, probably wider than the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> could have held against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> hordes. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> reports that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phocians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis</b></span> had improved the defenses of the pass by channelling the stream from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hot springs</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hot_spring</b></span> to create a marsh, and it was a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>causeway</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Causeway</b></span> across this marsh which was only wide enough for a single <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>chariot</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chariot</b></span> to traverse. In a later passage, describing a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Gaulish</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gauls</b></span> attempt to force the pass, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> states The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> on both sides proved useless, as the ground at the Pass is not only narrow, but also smooth because of the natural <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>rock</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Rock_music</b></span>, while most of it is slippery owing to its being covered with streams...the losses of the barbarians it was impossible to discover exactly. For the number of them that disappeared beneath the mud was great.
<br>
<br>It is also said that on the southern side of the track stood cliffs that overlooked the pass. However, a glance at any photograph of the pass shows there are no cliffs, only steep slopes covered in thorny bushes and trees. Although no obstacle to individuals, such terrain would not be passable by an army and its baggage train.
<br>
<br>On the north side of the roadway was the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Malian Gulf</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Malian_Gulf</b></span>, into which the land shelved gently. When the <span style='color: blue'><b>Gauls</b></span> attempted to force the pass, the shallowness of the water gave the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet great difficulty getting close enough to the fighting to bombard the <span style='color: blue'><b>Gauls</b></span> with ship-borne <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>missile</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Missile</b></span> weapons.
<br>
<br>Along the path itself was a series of three constrictions, or gates (pylai), and at the center gate a wall that had been erected by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phocians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis</b></span>, in the previous century, to aid in their defense against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thessalian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thessaly</b></span> invasions. The name <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hot Gates</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> comes from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hot springs</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hot_spring</b></span> that were located there.
<br>
<br>The terrain of the battlefield was nothing that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> and his forces were accustomed to. Although coming from a mountainous country, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were not prepared for the real nature of the country they had invaded. The pure ruggedness of this area is caused by torrential downpours for four months of the year, combined with an intense summer season of scorching heat that cracks the ground. Vegetation is scarce and consists of low, thorny shrubs. The hillsides along the pass are covered in thick brush, with some plants reaching 10 feet (3.0 m) high. With the sea on one side and steep, impassable hills on the other, King <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> and his men chose the perfect topographical position to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invaders.
<br>
<br>Today, the pass is not near the sea, but is several kilometres inland because of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sedimentation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sedimentation</b></span> in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Malian Gulf</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Malian_Gulf</b></span>. The old track appears at the foot of the hills around the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Plain</b></span>, flanked by a modern road. Recent core samples indicate that the pass was only <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>100 metres</span> <span style='color: green'><b>100_metres</b></span> (330 ft) wide, and the waters came up to the gates: Little do the visitors realize that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> took place across the road from the monument. The pass still is a natural defensive position to modern armies, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>British Commonwealth</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Commonwealth_of_Nations</b></span> forces in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>World War II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>World_War_II</b></span> made a defense in 1941 against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Nazi</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nazi_Germany</b></span> invasion metres from the original battlefield.
<br>
<br>On the fifth day after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> arrival at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> and the first day of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> finally resolved to attack the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. First, he ordered 5,000 archers to fire a barrage of arrows, but they were ineffective; they fired from at least 100 yards away, according to modern day scholars, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>' bronze shields and helmets deflected the arrows. After that, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> sent a force of 10,000 <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cissians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Khuzestan_Province</b></span> to take the defenders prisoner and bring them before him. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> soon launched a frontal assault, in waves of around 10,000 men, on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> position. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fought in front of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phocian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis</b></span> wall, at the narrowest part of the pass, which enabled them to use as few soldiers as possible. Details of the tactics are scant; Diodorus says, the men stood shoulder to shoulder, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> were superior in valor and in the great size of their shields. This probably describes the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>standard Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_language</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span>, in which the men formed a wall of overlapping shields and layered spear points protruding out from the sides of the shields, which would have been highly effective as long as it spanned the width of the pass. The weaker shields, and shorter spears and swords of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> prevented them from effectively engaging the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> says that the units for each <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> were kept together; units were rotated in and out of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> to prevent <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>fatigue</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battledress</b></span>, which implies the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> had more men than necessary to block the pass. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> killed so many <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span> that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> is said to have stood up three times from the seat from which he was watching the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>. According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Ctesias</b></span>, the first wave was cut to ribbons, with only two or three <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> killed in return.
<br>
<br>According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> and Diodorus, the king, having taken the measure of the enemy, threw his best troops into a second assault the same day, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Immortals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Immortality</b></span>, an elite corps of 10,000 men. However, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Immortals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Immortality</b></span> fared no better than the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>, and failed to make any headway against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> apparently used a tactic of feigning retreat, and then turning and killing the enemy troops when they ran after them.
<br>
<br>On the second day, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> again sent in the infantry to attack the pass, supposing that their enemies, being so few, were now disabled by wounds and could no longer resist. However, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> had no more success on the second day than on the first. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> at last stopped the assault and withdrew to his camp, totally perplexed.
<br>
<br>Later that day, however, as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> king was pondering what to do next, he received a windfall; a Trachinian named <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ephialtes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephialtes_of_Trachis</b></span> informed him of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mountain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mountain</b></span> path around <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> and offered to guide the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ephialtes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephialtes_of_Trachis</b></span> was motivated by the desire for a reward. For this act, the name <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ephialtes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephialtes_of_Trachis</b></span> received a lasting stigma; it came to mean nightmare in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek language</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_language</b></span> and to symbolize the archetypal traitor in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek culture</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> reports that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> sent his commander <span style='color: blue'><b>Hydarnes</b></span> that evening, with the men under his command, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Immortals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Immortality</b></span>, to encircle the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> via the path. However, he does not say who those men were. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Immortals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_NCIS_episodes</b></span> had been bloodied on the first day, so it is possible that <span style='color: blue'><b>Hydarnes</b></span> may have been given overall command of an enhanced force including what was left of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Immortals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Immortality</b></span>; according to Diodorus, <span style='color: blue'><b>Hydarnes</b></span> had a force of 20,000 for the mission. The path led from east of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> camp along the ridge of Mt. Anopaea behind the cliffs that flanked the pass. It branched, with one path leading to <span style='color: blue'><b>Phocis</b></span> and the other down to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Malian Gulf</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Malian_Gulf</b></span> at Alpenus, the first town of <span style='color: blue'><b>Locris</b></span>.
<br>
<br>At daybreak on the third day, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phocians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis</b></span> guarding the path above <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> became aware of the outflanking <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian column</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persian_column</b></span> by the rustling of oak leaves. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> says they jumped up and were greatly <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>amazed</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Amazed</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Hydarnes</b></span> was perhaps just as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>amazed</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Amazed</b></span> to see them hastily arming themselves as they were to see him and his forces. He feared they were <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Michigan_State_Spartans</b></span> but was informed by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ephialtes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephialtes_of_Trachis</b></span> that they were not. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phocians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis</b></span> retreated to a nearby hill to make their stand (assuming the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> had come to attack them). However, not wishing to be delayed, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> merely shot a volley of arrows at them, before bypassing them to continue with their encirclement of the main <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> force.
<br>
<br>Learning from a runner that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phocians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis</b></span> had not held the path, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> called a council of war at dawn. According to Diodorus, a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> called Tyrrhastiadas, a Cymaean by birth, warned the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. Some of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> argued for withdrawal, but <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> resolved to stay at the pass with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>. Upon discovering that his army had been encircled, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> told his allies that they could leave if they wanted to. While many of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> took him up on his offer and fled, around two thousand soldiers stayed behind to fight and die. Knowing that the end was near, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> marched into the open field and met the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> head-on. Many of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> contingents then either chose to withdraw (without orders) or were ordered to leave by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> (<span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> admits that there is some doubt about which actually happened). The contingent of 700 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thespians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thespiae</b></span>, led by their general <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Demophilus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Demophilus_of_Thespiae</b></span>, refused to leave and committed themselves to the fight. Also present were the 400 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thebes,_Greece</b></span> and probably the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helots</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span> who had accompanied the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>' actions have been the subject of much discussion. It is commonly stated that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> were obeying the laws of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> by not retreating, but it seems it was actually the failure to retreat from <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> that gave rise to the notion that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> never retreated. It is also possible that, recalling the words of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Oracle</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> was committed to sacrifice his life in order to save <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>. However, since the prophecy was specific to him, this seems a poor reason to commit 1,500 other men to a fight to the death.
<br>
<br>The most likely theory is that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> chose to form a rearguard so that the other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> contingents could get away. If all the troops had retreated, the open ground beyond the pass would have allowed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> to run the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> down. If they had all remained at the pass, they would have been encircled and would eventually have all been killed. By covering the retreat and continuing to block the pass, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> could save more than 3,000 men, who would be able to fight again.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thebes,_Greece</b></span> have also been the subject of some discussion. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> suggests they were brought to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> as hostages to ensure the good behavior of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thebes,_Greece</b></span>. However, as <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> long ago pointed out, if they were hostages, why not send them away with the rest of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>? The likelihood is that these were the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Theban</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Theban_hegemony</b></span> loyalists, who unlike the majority of their fellow citizens, objected to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> domination. They thus probably came to <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> of their own free will and stayed to the end because they could not return to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thebes,_Greece</b></span> if the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> conquered <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thespians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thespiae</b></span>, resolved as they were not to submit to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>, faced the destruction of their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> if the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> took <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span>.
<br>
<br>However, this alone does not explain the fact that they remained; the remainder of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thespiae</b></span> was successfully evacuated before the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> arrived there. It seems that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thespians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thespiae</b></span> volunteered to remain as a simple act of self-sacrifice, all the more amazing since their contingent represented every single <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> could muster. This seems to have been a particularly Thespian trait – on at least two other occasions in later history, a Thespian force would commit itself to a fight to the death.
<br>
<br>At dawn, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> made libations, pausing to allow the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Immortals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Immortality</b></span> sufficient time to descend the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mountain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mountain_warfare</b></span>, and then began his advance. A <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> force of 10,000 men, comprising light infantry and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>, charged at the front of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> formation. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> this time sallied forth from the wall to meet the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> in the wider part of the pass, in an attempt to slaughter as many <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> as they could. They fought with spears, until every spear was shattered, and then switched to xiphē (short swords). In this struggle, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> states that two of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>' brothers fell: <span style='color: blue'><b>Abrocomes</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Hyperanthes</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> also died in the assault, shot down by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> archers, and the two sides fought over his body; the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> took possession. As the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Immortals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Immortality</b></span> approached, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> withdrew and took a stand on a hill behind the wall. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thebes,_Greece</b></span> moved away from their companions, and with hands upraised, advanced toward the barbarians... (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Rawlinson</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Richard_Rawlinson</b></span> translation), but a few were slain before their surrender was accepted. The king later had the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Theban</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Theban_hegemony</b></span> prisoners branded with the royal mark. Of the remaining defenders, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> says:
<br>
<br>Here they defended themselves to the last, those who still had swords using them, and the others resisting with their hands and teeth.
<br>
<br>Tearing down part of the wall, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> ordered the hill surrounded, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rained down arrows until every last <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> was dead. In 1939, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>archaeologist</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archaeology</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spyridon Marinatos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spyridon_Marinatos</b></span>, excavating at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, found large numbers of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> bronze arrowheads on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Kolonos Hill</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kolonos_Hill</b></span>, which changed the identification of the hill on which the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> were thought to have died from a smaller one nearer the wall.
<br>
<br>The pass at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> was thus opened to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army, according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, at the cost to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> of up to 20,000 fatalities. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> rearguard, meanwhile, was annihilated, with a probable loss of 2,000 men, including those killed on the first two days of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> says, at one point 4,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> died, but assuming the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phocians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis</b></span> guarding the track were not killed during the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> (as <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> implies), this would be almost every <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> soldier present (by <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' own estimates), and this number is probably too high.
<br>
<br>When the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> recovered <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>' body, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>, in a rage against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>, ordered that the head be cut off and the body <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>crucified</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Crucifixion</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> observes this was very uncommon for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, as they traditionally treated valiant warriors with great honour (the example of <span style='color: blue'><b>Pytheas</b></span>, captured off <span style='color: blue'><b>Skiathos</b></span> before the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span>, strengthens this suggestion). However, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> was known for his rage. Legend has it that he had the very water of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> whipped because it would not obey him.
<br>
<br>After the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>' departure, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> collected their dead and buried them on the hill. After the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion was repulsed, a stone lion was erected at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> to commemorate <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>. A full 40 years after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>' bones were returned to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, where he was buried again with full honors; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>funeral games</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Funeral_games</b></span> were held every year in his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>memory</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Memory</b></span>.
<br>
<br>With <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> now opened to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army, the continuation of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>blockade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Blockade</b></span> at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span> by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet became irrelevant. The simultaneous naval Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span> had been a tactical stalemate, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek navy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hellenic_Navy</b></span> was able to retreat in good order to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Saronic Gulf</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Saronic_Gulf</b></span>, where they helped to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ferry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ferry</b></span> the remaining Athenian citizens to the island of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Following <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army proceeded to sack and burn <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Thespiae</b></span>, the Boeotian cities that had not submitted, before it marched on the now evacuated <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>. Meanwhile, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> (for the most part Peloponnesians) preparing to defend the Isthmus of <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span>, demolished the single road that led through it and built a wall across it. As at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, making this an effective strategy required the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek navy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hellenic_Navy</b></span> to stage a simultaneous <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>blockade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Blockade</b></span>, barring the passage of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> navy across the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Saronic Gulf</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Saronic_Gulf</b></span>, so that troops could not be landed directly on the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>. However, instead of a mere <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>blockade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Blockade</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> persuaded the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> to seek a decisive victory against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet. Luring the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> navy into the Straits of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet was able to destroy much of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet in the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>, which essentially ended the threat to the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Fearing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> might attack the bridges across the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> and trap his army in <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> now retreated with much of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army back to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>, though nearly all of them died of starvation and disease on the return voyage. He left a handpicked force, under <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>, to complete the conquest the following year. However, under pressure from the Athenians, the Peloponnesians eventually agreed to try to force <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, and they marched on <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> retreated to <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span> to lure the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> into open terrain, and the two sides eventually met near the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>. At the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army won a decisive victory, destroying much of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army and ending the invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. Meanwhile, at the near-simultaneous naval Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>, they also destroyed much of the remaining <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet, thereby reducing the threat of further invasions.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> is arguably the most famous <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> in European ancient history, repeatedly referenced in ancient, recent, and contemporary culture. In <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Western culture</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Western_culture</b></span> at least, it is the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> who are lauded for their performance in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>. However, within the context of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> was undoubtedly a defeat for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. It seems clear that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> strategy was to hold off the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span>; whatever they may have intended, it was presumably not their desire to surrender all of <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span> to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> position at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, despite being massively outnumbered, was nearly impregnable. If the position had been held for even a little longer, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> might have had to retreat for lack of food and water. Thus, despite the heavy losses, forcing the pass was strategically a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> victory, but the successful retreat of the bulk of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> troops was in its own sense a victory as well. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> itself had showed what a few free men, willing to do anything for victory against the invaders, could accomplish, and the defeat at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> had turned <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> and the men under his command into martyrs. That boosted the morale of all <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> soldiers in the second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion.
<br>
<br>It is sometimes stated that <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> was a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pyrrhic victory</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pyrrhic_victory</b></span> for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> (i.e., one in which the victor is as damaged by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> as the defeated party). However, there is no suggestion by <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> that the effect on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> forces was that. The idea ignores the fact that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> would, in the aftermath of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, conquer the majority of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kingdom_of_Greece</b></span>, and the fact that they were still fighting in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kingdom_of_Greece</b></span> a year later. Alternatively, the argument is sometimes advanced that the last stand at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> was a successful delaying action that gave the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek navy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hellenic_Navy</b></span> time to prepare for the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>. However, compared to the probable time (about one month) between <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>, the time bought was negligible. Furthermore, this idea also neglects the fact that a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek navy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hellenic_Navy</b></span> was fighting at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span> during the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, incurring losses in the process. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>George Cawkwell</span> <span style='color: green'><b>George_Cawkwell</b></span> suggests that the gap between <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span> was caused by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>' systematically reducing <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> opposition in <span style='color: blue'><b>Phocis</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span>, and not as a result of the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>; thus, as a delaying action, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> was insignificant compared to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>' own <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>procrastination</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Procrastination</b></span>. Far from labeling <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> as a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pyrrhic victory</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pyrrhic_victory</b></span>, modern academic treatises on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> tend to emphasise the success of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> in breaching the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>formidable</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Formidable-class_frigate</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> position and the subsequent conquest of the majority of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. For instance, Cawkwell states: he was successful on both land and sea, and the Great Invasion began with a brilliant success. ... <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> had every reason to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>congratulate</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Congratulate_(song)</b></span> himself, while Lazenby describes the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> defeat as disastrous.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The fame</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Fame</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> is thus principally derived not from its effect on the outcome of the war but for the inspirational example it set. <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> is famous because of the heroism of the doomed rearguard, who, despite facing certain death, remained at the pass. Ever since, the events of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> have been the source of effusive praise from many sources: ...the fairest sister-victories which the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sun</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ra</b></span> has ever seen, yet they would never dare to compare their combined glory with the glorious defeat of King <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> and his men. A second reason is the example it set of free men, fighting for their country and their freedom:
<br>
<br>So almost immediately, contemporary <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> saw <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> as a critical moral and culture lesson. In universal terms, a small, free people had willingly outfought huge numbers of imperial subjects who advanced under the lash. More specifically, the Western idea that soldiers themselves decide where, how, and against whom they will fight was contrasted against the Eastern notion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>despotism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Despotism</b></span> and monarchy—freedom proving the stronger idea as the more courageous fighting of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, and their later victories at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> attested.
<br>
<br>While this paradigm of free men outfighting slaves can be seen as a rather sweeping over-generalization (there are many counter-examples), it is nevertheless true that many commentators have used <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> to illustrate this point.
<br>
<br>Militarily, although the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> was actually not decisive in the context of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> is of some significance on the basis of the first two days of fighting. The performance of the defenders is used as an example of the advantages of training, equipment, and good use of terrain as force multipliers.
<br>
<br>There are several monuments around the battlefield of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>.
<br>
<br>A well-known <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>epigram</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Epigram</b></span>, usually attributed to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Simonides</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Simonides_of_Ceos</b></span>, was engraved as an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>epitaph</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Epitaph</b></span> on a commemorative stone placed on top of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>burial mound</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tumulus</b></span> of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>. It is also the hill on which the last of them died. The original stone has not survived, but in 1955, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>epitaph</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Epitaph</b></span> was engraved on a new stone. The text from <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> is:
<br>
<br>Oh stranger, tell the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lacedaemonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sparta</b></span> that
<br>we lie here, obedient to their words.
<br>
<br>The alternative ancient reading substitutes laws or orders for words. In other words, the orders are not personal but refer to official and binding phrases (the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ancient Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_literature</b></span> term can also refer to a formal speech).
<br>
<br>The form of this <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ancient Greek poetry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_literature</b></span> is an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>elegiac couplet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Elegiac_couplet</b></span>, commonly used for epitaphs. Some <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>English</span> <span style='color: green'><b>English_poetry</b></span> renderings are given in the table below. It is also an example of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Laconian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Laconia</b></span> brevity, a spartan style of verse that allows for varying interpretations of the meaning of the poem. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ioannis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>John_the_Apostle</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ziogas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Michalis_Ziogas</b></span> points out that the usual <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>English</span> <span style='color: green'><b>English_poetry</b></span> translations are far from the only interpretation possible, and indicate much about the romantic tendencies of the translators.
<br>
<br>It was well known in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ancient Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> that all the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> who had been sent to <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> had been killed there (with the exception of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aristodemus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aristodemus_of_Sparta</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Pantites</b></span>), and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>epitaph</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Epitaph</b></span> exploits the conceit that there was nobody left to bring the news of their deeds back to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_language</b></span> epitaphs often appealed to the passing reader (always called 'stranger') for sympathy, but the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>epitaph</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Epitaph</b></span> for the dead <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> took this convention much further than usual, asking the reader to make a personal journey to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> to break the news that the Spartan expeditionary force had been wiped out. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The stranger</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Stranger_(newspaper)</b></span> is also asked to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>stress</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Psychological_stress</b></span> that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> died 'fulfilling their orders'.
<br>
<br>Also obedience in its highest form is not obedience to a constant and compulsory law, but a persuaded or voluntary yielded obedience to an issued command .... His name who leads the armies of <span style='color: blue'><b>Heaven</b></span> is "Faithful and True"... and all deeds which are done in alliance with these armies ... are essentially deeds of faith, which therefore ... is at once the source and the substance of all known deed, rightly so called ... as set forth in the last word of the noblest group of words ever, so far as I know, uttered by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>simple man</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Simple_Man_(Lynyrd_Skynyrd_song)</b></span> concerning his practice, being the final testimony of the leaders of a great practical nation
<br>
<br>Tell, stranger, to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> that you saw us lying here
<br>since we followed the sacred laws of the fatherland
<br>
<br>Additionally, there is a modern monument at the site, called the "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> Monument", in honour of the Spartan king. It features a bronze statue of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>. A sign, under the statue, reads simply: "Come and take them!"—as in answer to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>' demand that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> give up their weapons. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>metope</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Metope</b></span> below depicts <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> scenes. The two <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>marble</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Marble</b></span> statues on the left and the right of the monument represent, respectively, the river <span style='color: blue'><b>Eurotas</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mount Taygetos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Taygetus</b></span>, famous landmarks of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>.
<br>
<br>In 1997, a second monument was officially unveiled by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> government, dedicated to the 700 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thespians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thespiae</b></span> who fought with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>. The monument is made of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>marble</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Marble</b></span> and features a bronze statue depicting the god <span style='color: blue'><b>Eros</b></span>, to whom the ancient <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thespians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thespiae</b></span> accorded particular religious veneration. Under the statue, a sign reads: "In <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>memory</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Random-access_memory</b></span> of the seven hundred <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thespians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thespiae</b></span>."
<br>
<br>A plate below the statue explains its symbolism:
<br>
<br>The headless male figure symbolizes the anonymous sacrifice of the 700 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thespians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thespiae</b></span> to their country.
<br>The outstretched chest symbolizes the struggle, the gallantry, the strength, the bravery and the courage.
<br>The open wing symbolizes the victory, the glory, the soul, the spirit and the freedom.
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The broken wing</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Broken_Wing_(film)</b></span> symbolizes the voluntary sacrifice and death.
<br>The naked body symbolizes <span style='color: blue'><b>Eros</b></span>, the most important god of the ancient <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thespians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thespiae</b></span>, a god of creation, beauty and life.
<br>The monument to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thespians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thespiae</b></span> is placed beside the one to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Michigan_State_Spartans</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' colorful account of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> has provided history with many apocryphal incidents and conversations away from the main historical events. These accounts are obviously not verifiable, but they form an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>integral</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Integral</b></span> part of the legend of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> and often demonstrate the laconic speech (and wit) of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Michigan_State_Spartans</b></span> to good effect.
<br>
<br>For instance, <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> recounts, in his Sayings of Spartan Women, upon his departure, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>' wife <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Gorgo</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gorgon</b></span> asked what she should do if he did not return, to which <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> replied, Marry a good man and have good children.
<br>
<br>It is reported that, upon arriving at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> sent a mounted scout to reconnoiter. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> allowed him to come up to the camp, observe them, and depart. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> found the scout's reports of the size of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> force, and that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Michigan_State_Spartans</b></span> were indulging in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>calisthenics</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Calisthenics</b></span> and combing their long hair, laughable. Seeking the counsel of <span style='color: blue'><b>Demaratus</b></span>, an exiled Spartan king in his retinue, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> was told the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Michigan_State_Spartans</b></span> were preparing for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, and it was their custom to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>adorn</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_Middle-earth_rivers</b></span> their hair when they were about to risk their lives. <span style='color: blue'><b>Demaratus</b></span> called them the bravest men in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and warned the Great King they intended to dispute the pass. He emphasized that he had tried to warn <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> earlier in the campaign, but the king had refused to believe him. He added that if <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> ever managed to subdue the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Michigan_State_Spartans</b></span>, there is no other nation in all the world which will venture to lift a hand in their defense.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> also describes <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>' reception of a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> embassy. The ambassador told <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> would offer him the kingship of all <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> if he joined with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> answered: If you had any knowledge of the noble things of life, you would refrain from coveting others' possessions; but for me to die for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> is better than to be the sole ruler over the people of my race. Then the ambassador asked him more forcefully to surrender their arms. To this <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> gave his famous answer: Μολὼν λαβέ (pronounced <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> pronunciation:  Come and get them.
<br>
<br>Such Laconic bravery doubtlessly helped to maintain morale. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> writes that when <span style='color: blue'><b>Dienekes</b></span>, a Spartan soldier, was informed that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> arrows would be so numerous as to block out the sun, he retorted, unconcerned: So much the better...then we shall fight our <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> in the shade.
<br>
<br>After the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> was curious as to what the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> had been trying to do (presumably because they had had so few men) and had some Arcadian deserters interrogated in his presence. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The answer</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Answer_(band)</b></span> was: all the other men were participating in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympic Games</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Olympic_Games</b></span>. When <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> asked what the prize was for the winner, the answer was: an olive-wreath. Upon hearing this, <span style='color: blue'><b>Tigranes</b></span>, a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> general, said: <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Good heavens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Good_Heavens</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>, what kind of men are these that you have pitted against us? It is not for riches that they contend but for honor! (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Godley</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_Godley</b></span> translation) or otherwise, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ye Gods</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ye_Gods</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>, what men have you brought us to fight against? Men that fight not for gold, but for glory.
<br>
<br>The Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span> has remained a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cultural icon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Popular_culture</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>western civilization</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Western_culture</b></span> ever since it was fought. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> is revisited in countless adages and works of popular culture, such as in films (e.g., <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The 300 Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_300_Spartans</b></span> (1962) and 300 (2007), based on the events during and close to the time of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>), in literature, in song, in television programs, and in video games. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> is also discussed in many articles and books on the theory and practice of warfare.
<br>
<br>Prior to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> remembered the <span style='color: blue'><b>Dorians</b></span>, an ethnic distinction which applied to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, as the conquerors and displacers of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>. After the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, Spartan culture became an inspiration and object of emulation, a phenomenon known as Laconophilia.
<br>
<br>Similarities between the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span> and the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> Gate have been recognized by both ancient and modern authors,which describe it as a kind of reversal of the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span> calling it "the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span>". Here, on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> I the Great's campaign against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> in 330  BC to exact revenge for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, he faced the same situation, encountering a last stand of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> forces (under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ariobarzanes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ariobarzanes_of_Persis</b></span>) at a narrow pass near <span style='color: blue'><b>Persepolis</b></span> who held the invaders for a month, until their fall as the enemy found a path to their rear. There are even accounts that a local shepherd informed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> I's forces about the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>secret path</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Secret_Path</b></span>, just as a local <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> showed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> forces a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>secret path</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Secret_Path</b></span> around the pass at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>
