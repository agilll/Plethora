In the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> of 480 B.C.E. an alliance of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> city-states fought the invading <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> army at the pass of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a>. Vastly outnumbered, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> delayed the enemy in one of the most famous last stands of history. A small force led by King <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> blocked the only road through which the massive army of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> could pass. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Persians?lang=en'>The Persians</a> succeeded in defeating the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> but sustained heavy losses, incredibly disproportionate to those of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>. A local resident named <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephialtes_of_Trachis?lang=en'>Ephialtes</a> betrayed the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>, revealing a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mountain_warfare?lang=en'>mountain</a> path that led behind the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> lines. Dismissing the rest of the army, King <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I stayed behind with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Thermopylae?lang=en'>300 Spartans</a>, 400 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thebes,_Greece?lang=en'>Thebans</a>, and 700 Thespian volunteers. Though they knew it meant their own deaths, they secured the retreat of the other <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> forces.
<br>
<br>The losses of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> army alarmed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>. When his navy was later defeated at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Salamis</a> he fled <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>, leaving only part of his force to finish the conquest of the nation. That force was defeated at the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plataea?lang=en'>Plataea</a>. 
<br>
<br>The performance of the defenders at the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> is often used as an example of the advantages of training, equipment, and good use of terrain to maximize an army's potential, as well as a symbol of courage against overwhelming odds. The heroic sacrifice of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thespiae?lang=en'>Thespians</a> has captured the minds of many throughout the ages and has given birth to many cultural references as a result. Most of what historians know about the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> at this time, however, is through <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> and other <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> sources. For the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> were barbarians, culturally inferior and a threat to their ordered way of life. They tended to depict <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Effeminacy?lang=en'>effeminate</a>, over-fond of luxury, and, ultimately, no match for virtuous manly <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>. 
<br>
<br>The Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> can be understood in terms of an us and them polarity that suggests an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/East–West_dichotomy?lang=en'>East-West dichotomy</a>, with the West representing order, self-restraint, and freedom while the East represents the opposite. In this process, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> was an ideal person to be chosen as an example of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia?lang=en'>Asian</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Despotism?lang=en'>despotism</a> and excessive <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hubris?lang=en'>hubris</a>..
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>, king of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persia</a>, had been preparing for years to continue the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greco-Persian_Wars?lang=en'>Greco-Persian Wars</a> started by his father, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius</a>. In 481 B.C.E., after four years of preparation, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> army and navy arrived in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Asia Minor</a>. A <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bridge?lang=en'>bridge</a> of ships had been made at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_recurring_alien_characters_in_Stargate_SG-1?lang=en'>Abydos</a>. This allowed the land forces to cross the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dardanelles?lang=en'>Hellespont</a>.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> of Halicarnassus, who wrote the first history of this war, gave the size of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>' army as follows:
<br>
<br>This number needs to be nearly doubled in order to account for support troops, and thus <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> reports that the whole force numbered 5,283,220 men, a figure which has been rejected by modern historians. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poetry?lang=en'>poet</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Simonides_of_Ceos?lang=en'>Simonides</a>, who was a near-contemporary, talks of four million. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ctesias?lang=en'>Ctesias</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Knidos?lang=en'>Cnidus</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia?lang=en'>Artaxerxes Mnemon</a>'s personal <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician?lang=en'>physician</a>, wrote a history of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persia</a> according to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> sources that unfortunately has not survived, but gives 800,000 as the total number of the original army that met in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doriscus?lang=en'>Doriskos</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrace?lang=en'>Thrace</a>, after crossing the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dardanelles?lang=en'>Hellespont</a>. Modern scholars have given different estimates based on knowledge of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> military systems, their logistical capabilities, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> countryside, and supplies available along the army's route.
<br>
<br>One school of thought rejects the figures given in ancient texts as exaggerations on the part of the victors. Based on analysis of the resources available to armies of the ancient era, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> force numbered between 60,000 and 120,000 combatants, plus a retinue of non-combatants, made larger because of the presence of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> king and high-ranking nobility. The upper limit was 250,000 total land forces. The main reason most often given for these values is a lack of water; <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frederick_Barton_Maurice?lang=en'>Sir Frederick Maurice</a><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frederick_Barton_Maurice?lang=en'>Frederick Maurice</a>al in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/World_War_I?lang=en'>World War I</a>, was among the first to claim that the army could not have surpassed 175,000, due to lack of water.
<br>
<br>A second school contends that ancient sources do give realistic numbers. According to the texts, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> at the end of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plataea?lang=en'>Plataea</a> mustered 110,000 (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>) or 100,000 (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pompey?lang=en'>Pompeius</a>) troops: 38,700 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>hoplites</a> and 71,300 or 61,300 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peltast?lang=en'>peltasts</a> respectively, the difference probably being 10,000 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helots?lang=en'>helots</a>. In that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a>, according to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, they faced 300,000 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> and 50,000 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> allies. This gives a 3-to-1 ratio for the two armies, which proponents of the school consider a realistic proportion.
<br>
<br>Furthermore, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clan_Munro?lang=en'>Munro</a> and Macan argue for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Literary_realism?lang=en'>realism</a> based on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> giving the names of 6 major commanders and 29 μυρίαρχοι (muriarxoi)—leaders of the baivabaram, the basic unit of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> infantry, which numbered about 10,000 strong. As troops were lost through attrition, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> preferred to dissolve crippled baivabarams to replenish the ranks of others. Adding casualties of the battles and attrition due to the need to guard cities and strategic objectives yields a force of 400,000 minimum.
<br>
<br>According to this view, there was no lack of water. The available surface water in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> today satisfies the needs of a much larger population than the number of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>' troops, though the majority of that water is used for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Irrigation?lang=en'>irrigation</a>. This thesis, however, overlooks the presence of the civilian population.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/N._G._L._Hammond?lang=en'>Nicholas Hammond</a> accepts 300,000 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> at the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plataea?lang=en'>Plataea</a>, though he claims that the numbers at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doriscus?lang=en'>Doriskos</a> were smaller, without explaining how the change in numbers happened.
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metrology?lang=en'>metrologist</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livio_Catullo_Stecchini?lang=en'>Livio Catullo Stecchini</a> argues that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ctesias?lang=en'>Ctesias</a>'s figure of 800,000 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> troops for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> army is accurate and that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>'s figure of 1,700,000 includes both <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> and support troops.
<br>
<br>Dr. Manousos Kampouris argues that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>' 1,700,000 for the infantry plus 80,000 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>cavalry</a> (including support) is realistic for various reasons, including the size of the area from which the army was drafted (from modern-day <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Libya?lang=en'>Libya</a> to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pakistan?lang=en'>Pakistan</a>), the lack of security against spies, the ratios of land troops to fleet troops, of infantry to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>cavalry</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> troops to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> troops.
<br>
<br>On the other hand, Christos Romas believes that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> troops accompanying <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> were a little over 400,000.
<br>
<br>To this number must be added 1,000 other <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Laconia?lang=en'>Lacedemonians</a> mentioned by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diodorus_Siculus?lang=en'>Diodorus Siculus</a> and perhaps 800 auxiliary troops from other <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> cities. Diodorus gives 4,000 as the total of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> troops, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pausanias_of_Sparta?lang=en'>Pausanias</a> 11,200. Modern historians, who usually consider <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> more reliable, prefer his claim of 7,000 men.
<br>
<br>Why did <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I only bring 300 men? Apparently at the time there was a religious festival in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>, and the soldiers, by law, were not allowed to travel. The only exception to this was <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I's body guard of 300 men.
<br>
<br>After the expedition to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> was under way, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> sent messengers to all the states offering blandishments if they would submit and asking earth and water from their soil as a token of submission. Many smaller states submitted. The Athenians threw their envoys into a pit, and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> threw theirs into a well, taunting them with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Retort?lang=en'>retort</a>, Dig it out for yourselves.
<br>
<br>Support gathered around these two leading states. A congress met at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Late_Autumn_(1960_film)?lang=en'>late autumn</a> of 481 B.C.E., and a confederate alliance of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> city-states was formed. It had the power to send envoys asking for assistance and to dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points after joint consultation. There is no evidence that any one state was in charge. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> calls them simply the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> or the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> who had banded together. The interests of all the states played a part in determining defensive strategy. Nothing else is known about the internal workings of the congress or the discussion during its proceedings.
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> army first encountered a joint force of 10,000 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athenian</a> and Spartan <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>hoplites</a> led by Euanetus and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> in the vale of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vale_of_Tempe?lang=en'>Tempe</a>. Upon hearing this, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> sent the army through the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sarantaporo?lang=en'>Sarantaporo</a> strait, which was <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Unguarded_(Amy_Grant_album)?lang=en'>unguarded</a>, and sidestepped them. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>hoplites</a>, warned by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great?lang=en'>Alexander</a> I of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Macedonia?lang=en'>Macedon</a>, vacated the pass. The allied <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> judged that the next strategic <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Choke_point?lang=en'>choke point</a> where the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> army could be stopped was <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a>. They decided to defend it as well as to send a fleet to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artemisium?lang=en'>Artemision</a>, a naval <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Choke_point?lang=en'>choke point</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>' army was being supplied and supported by sea. Using the fleet they might also have crossed Maliacos bay and outflanked the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> army again.
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> high strategy is confirmed by an oration later in the same century:
<br>
<br>But while <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> showed these inclinations [to join the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a>], the Athenians, for their part, embarked in their ships and hastened to the defence of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Artemisium?lang=en'>Artemisium</a>; while the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Lacedaemonians</a> and some of their allies went off to make a stand at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a>, judging that the narrowness of the ground would enable them to secure the passage.
<br>
<br>Some modern historians, such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jerry_Bengtson?lang=en'>Bengtson</a>, claim that the purpose of the land force was to slow down the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> army while the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> navy was defeated at sea. Another theory is that the land army was to hold the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> army in the north for as long as possible, and defeat it through attrition, epidemics, and food deprivation.
<br>
<br>Some have argued that the Athenians felt confident of the small force and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I' presence being enough to stop the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a>, otherwise they would have already vacated their <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> and sent their whole army to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a>. Historians know of one case in which a small force did stop a larger invading force from the north; in 353 B.C.E./352 B.C.E. the Athenians managed to stop the forces of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_II_of_Macedon?lang=en'>Philip II</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Macedonia?lang=en'>Macedon</a> by deploying 5,000 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>hoplites</a> and 400 horsemen.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> is quite clear on the subject. He says:
<br>
<br>The force with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I was sent forward by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> in advance of their main body, that the sight of them might encourage the allies to fight, and hinder them from going over to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a>, as was likely they might have done had they seen that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> was backward. They intended presently, when they had celebrated the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carnea?lang=en'>Carneian Festival</a>, which was what now kept them at home, to leave a garrison in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>, and hasten in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Full_Force?lang=en'>full force</a> to join the army. The rest of the allies intended to act similarly; for it happened that the Olympic Festival fell exactly at this same period. None of them looked to see the contest at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> decided so speedily; wherefore they were content to send forward a mere advance guard. Such accordingly were the intentions of the allies.
<br>
<br>The Spartan king was put in charge of the army at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a>. Of his leadership, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> says only that they especially looked up to him. He was convinced that he was going to certain death, which he would not have been if he had thought the forces given him were adequate for a victory. He selected only men who had fathered sons that were old enough to take over the family responsibilities. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> mentions in his Sayings of Spartan Women, that after encouraging her husband before his departure for the battlefield, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gorgon?lang=en'>Gorgo</a>, the wife of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I asked him what she should do when he had left. To this he replied, Marry a good man and have good children.
<br>
<br>Another common saying of Spartan Women was, Come home with your shield or on it, meaning that the soldier was to return home either victorious (with your shield) or dead— carried away from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> field (on their shield), rather than fleeing the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> and dropping their shield in cowardice (as it was too heavy a piece of armor to carry while running).
<br>
<br>At the time, the pass of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> consisted of a track along the shore of the Gulf of Malis so narrow that only one <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chariot?lang=en'>chariot</a> could pass through. On the southern side of the track stood the cliffs, while on the north side was the gulf. Along the path was a series of three constrictions, or gates (pylai), and at the center gate a short wall that had been erected by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phocis?lang=en'>Phocians</a> in the previous century to aid in their defense against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thessaly?lang=en'>Thessalian</a> invasions. The name hot gates comes from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hot_spring?lang=en'>hot springs</a> that were located there.
<br>
<br>Today the pass is not that, but is inland, due to infilling of the Gulf of Malis. The old track appears at the foot of hills around the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plain?lang=en'>plain</a>, flanked by a modern road. It remains a natural defensive position to modern armies.
<br>
<br>When the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> army reached the entrance to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> instigated a council meeting. The Peloponnesians advised withdrawing to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isthmus_of_Corinth?lang=en'>isthmus</a> and defending only the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnese?lang=en'>Peloponnesus</a> there. They knew, of course, that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> would have to defeat <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> before they could arrive at the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isthmus_of_Corinth?lang=en'>isthmus</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phocis?lang=en'>Phocians</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Locris?lang=en'>Locrians</a>, whose states were located nearby, becoming indignant, advised defending <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> and sending for more help. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I thought it best to adopt their plan.
<br>
<br>Meanwhile the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> entered the pass and sent a mounted scout to reconnoiter. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> allowed him to come up to the camp, observe them and depart. When the scout reported to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> the size of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> force, and that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> were indulging in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Calisthenics?lang=en'>calisthenics</a> and combing their long hair, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> found the reports laughable. Seeking the counsel of a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> in his employ, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Demaratus?lang=en'>Demaratus</a>, he was told that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> were preparing for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> and that it was their custom to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Middle-earth_rivers?lang=en'>adorn</a> their hair beforehand. They were the bravest men in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>, he said, and they intended to dispute the pass.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> remained incredulous. According to another account, he did send emissaries to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> forces. At first he asked <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I to join him and offered him the kingship of all of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I answered, If you knew what is good in life, you would abstain from wishing for foreign things. For me it is better to die for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> than to be monarch over my compatriots.
<br>
<br>Then <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> asked him more forcefully to surrender their arms. To this <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I gave his noted answer, Μολών Λαβέ, which means Come take them. This quote has been repeated by many later generals and politicians, in order to express the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>' determination to risk a sacrifice rather than surrender without a fight. It is today the emblem of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_United_States_Army?lang=en'>First Army</a> Corps.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> morale was high. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> wrote that when <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dienekes?lang=en'>Dienekes</a>, a Spartan soldier, was informed that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> arrows would be so numerous as to blot out the sun, he remarked with characteristically laconic prose, So much the better, we shall fight in the shade. Today <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dienekes?lang=en'>Dienekes</a>'s phrase is the motto of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/20th_Armored_Division_(United_States)?lang=en'>20th Armored Division</a>.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> waited four days for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> force to disperse. On the fifth day he ordered the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Khuzestan_Province?lang=en'>Cissians</a> to take them prisoner and bring them before him.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> sent in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> at first perhaps because he preferred them for their bravery or perhaps, as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diodorus_Siculus?lang=en'>Diodorus Siculus</a> suggested, because he wanted them to bear the brunt of the fighting—the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> had been only recently conquered by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a>.
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> coming up to take the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> prisoner soon found themselves in a frontal assault. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> had camped on either side of the rebuilt <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phocis?lang=en'>Phocian</a> wall. The fact that it was guarded shows that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> were using it to establish a reference line for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a>, but they fought in front of it.
<br>
<br>Details of the tactics are somewhat scant. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> probably deployed in a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>phalanx</a>, a wall of overlapping shields and layered spearpoints, spanning the entire width of the pass. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> says that the units for each state were kept together. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Persians?lang=en'>The Persians</a>, armed with arrows and short spears, could not break through the long spears of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>phalanx</a>, nor were their lightly armored men a match for the superior armor, weaponry, and discipline of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>hoplites</a>.
<br>
<br>And yet there are some indications they did not fight entirely in close formation. They made use of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Feint?lang=en'>feint</a> to draw the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> in, pretending to retreat in disorder only to turn suddenly and attack the pursuing <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a>. In this way they killed so many <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> is said to have started up off the seat from which he was watching the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> three times. According to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ctesias?lang=en'>Ctesias</a> the first wave numbered 10,000 soldiers and were commanded by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artapanus_of_Alexandria?lang=en'>Artapanus</a>.
<br>
<br>The king then withdrew the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a>. Having taken the measure of the enemy, he threw the best troops he had into a second assault: <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_NCIS_episodes?lang=en'>The Immortals</a>, an elite corps of 10,000 men. On his side, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I had arranged a system of relays between the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>hoplites</a> of the various cities so as to constantly have fresh troops on the front line. Yet in the heat of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> the units did not get a chance to rotate. Being able to approach the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> line only in such numbers as the space allowed, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immortality?lang=en'>Immortals</a> succeeded no better than the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> had to withdraw them also. The first day of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> probably ended here.
<br>
<br>The assault failed again. The account of the slain gives some indication of why: The wall of bodies must have broken up the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> line and detracted from their morale. History judges them perhaps too harshly. Climbing over the bodies they could see that they had stepped into a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Killing_Machine?lang=en'>killing machine</a>, but the officers behind prevented them from withdrawing. The king at last stopped the assault and withdrew to his camp, totally perplexed. He now knew that a head-on confrontation against Spartan-led troops in a narrow place was the wrong approach.
<br>
<br>
<br>Late on the second day of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a>, as the king was pondering what to do next, he received a windfall circumstance: A Malian, named <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephialtes_of_Trachis?lang=en'>Ephialtes</a>, informed him of a path around <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> and offered to guide them. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephialtes_of_Trachis?lang=en'>Ephialtes</a> was motivated by the desire of a reward, though he was later assassinated.
<br>
<br>The path led from east of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> camp along the ridge of Mt. Anopaea behind the cliffs that flanked the pass. It branched, one path leading to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phocis?lang=en'>Phocis</a>, and the other down to the Gulf of Malis at Alpenus, first town of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Locris?lang=en'>Locris</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I had stationed 1000 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phocis?lang=en'>Phocian</a> volunteers on the heights to guard this path.
<br>
<br>For all their previous indignation and insistence on a defense at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a>, they were not prepared: There were no advance positions, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Factions_of_Halo?lang=en'>sentinels</a> or patrols. Their first warning of the approach of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immortality?lang=en'>Immortals</a> under <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hydarnes?lang=en'>Hydarnes</a> was the rustling of oak leaves at first light on the third day of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> says that they jumped up, suggesting that they were still asleep, and were greatly <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amazed?lang=en'>amazed</a>, which no alert unit should have been.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hydarnes?lang=en'>Hydarnes</a> was as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amazed?lang=en'>amazed</a> to see them hastily arming themselves. He feared that they were <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a>, but was enlightened by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephialtes_of_Trachis?lang=en'>Ephialtes</a>. Not wishing to be delayed by an assault, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hydarnes?lang=en'>Hydarnes</a> resorted to a tactic that later turned out to be the winning one: He fired showers of arrows at them. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phocis?lang=en'>Phocians</a> retreated to the crest of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mountain_warfare?lang=en'>mountain</a>, there to make a last stand (their story). <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Persians?lang=en'>The Persians</a> branched left to Alpenus. For this act, the name of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephialtes_of_Trachis?lang=en'>Ephialtes</a> received a lasting stigma: It means nightmare and is synonymous with traitor in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a>.
<br>
<br>None of the actions of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> were a surprise to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I. From a variety of sources, he was kept apprised of their every move, receiving <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Military_intelligence?lang=en'>intelligence</a> of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> outflanking movement before first light.
<br>
<br>When <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I learned that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phocis?lang=en'>Phocians</a> had not held, he called a council at dawn. During the council some <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> argued for withdrawal in the face of the overwhelming <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> advance, while others pledged to stay. After the council, many of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> forces did choose to withdraw. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> believed that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I blessed their departure with an order, but he also offered the alternate point of view: That those retreating forces departed without orders. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> had pledged themselves to fight to the death, while the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thebes,_Greece?lang=en'>Thebans</a> were held as hostage against their will. However, a contingent of about 700 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thespiae?lang=en'>Thespians</a>, led by general <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Demophilus_of_Thespiae?lang=en'>Demophilus</a>, the son of Diadromes, refused to leave with the other <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>, but cast their lot with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a>.
<br>
<br>Ostensibly the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> were obeying their oath and following the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delphi?lang=en'>oracle</a> from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delphi?lang=en'>Delphi</a>. However, it might also have been a calculated strategy to delay the advance of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> and cover the retreat of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> army. In fact, with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> so close at hand, the decision to stand and fight was probably a tactical requirement, one made more palatable by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delphi?lang=en'>oracle</a>. The significance of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thespiae?lang=en'>Thespians</a>' refusal to leave should not be ignored. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a>, as brave as their sacrifice indubitably was, were professional soldiers, trained from birth to be ready to give their lives in combat as Spartan law dictated. Conversely, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thespiae?lang=en'>Thespians</a> were citizen-soldiers (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Demophilus_of_Thespiae?lang=en'>Demophilus</a>, for example, made his living as an architect) who elected to add whatever they could to the fight, rather than allow the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> to be annihilated alone. Though their bravery is often overlooked by history, it was most certainly not overlooked by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a>, who are said to have exchanged cloaks with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thespiae?lang=en'>Thespians</a> and promised to be allies for eternity. At dawn <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> made libations. He paused to allow the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immortality?lang=en'>Immortals</a> sufficient time to descend the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mountain_warfare?lang=en'>mountain</a>, and then began his advance.
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> this time sallied forth from the wall to meet them in the wider part of the pass, in an attempt to slaughter as many as they could. They fought with spears until every spear was shattered and then switched to xiphoi (short swords). In this struggle <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> tells that two brothers of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> fell, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abrocomes?lang=en'>Abrocomes</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hyperanthes?lang=en'>Hyperanthes</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I also died in the assault.
<br>
<br>Receiving <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Military_intelligence?lang=en'>intelligence</a> that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephialtes_of_Trachis?lang=en'>Ephialtes</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immortality?lang=en'>Immortals</a> were coming up, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> withdrew and took a stand on a small hill behind the wall. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thebes,_Greece?lang=en'>Thebans</a> under Leontiades put hands up, but a few were slain before the surrender was accepted. Some of the remaining <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> were fighting with their hands and teeth. Tearing down part of the wall, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> ordered the hill surrounded and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> rained down arrows until the last <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> was dead. Archaeology has confirmed the arrow shower at the end.
<br>
<br>When the body of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I was recovered by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>, enraged at the loss of so many of his soldiers, ordered that the head be cut off, and the body <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crucifixion?lang=en'>crucified</a>. This was very uncommon for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a>: They had the habit of treating enemies that fought bravely against them with great honor, as the example of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pytheas?lang=en'>Pytheas</a> captured earlier, off <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Skyros?lang=en'>Skyros</a> shows. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>, however, was known for his rages, as when he had the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dardanelles?lang=en'>Hellespont</a> whipped because it would not obey him.
<br>
<br>After the departure and defeat of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> collected their dead and buried them on the hill. A stone lion was erected to commemorate <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I. Forty years after the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I' body was returned from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>, where he was buried again with full honors and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Funeral_games?lang=en'>funeral games</a> were held every year.
<br>
<br>The simultaneous naval Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Artemisium?lang=en'>Artemisium</a> was a draw, whereupon the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athenian</a> navy retreated. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Persians?lang=en'>The Persians</a> had control of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegean_Sea?lang=en'>Aegean Sea</a> and all of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> as far south as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attica?lang=en'>Attica</a>; the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> prepared to defend the Isthmus of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnese?lang=en'>Peloponnese</a>, while <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> sacked <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>, whose inhabitants had already fled to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Salamis</a> Island. In September, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> defeated the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> at the naval Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Salamis</a>, which led to the rapid retreat of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Remaining?lang=en'>The remaining</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> army, left under the charge of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mardonius?lang=en'>Mardonius</a>, was defeated in the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plataea?lang=en'>Plataea</a> by a combined <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> army again led by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a>, under the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Regent?lang=en'>regent</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pausanias_of_Sparta?lang=en'>Pausanias</a>.
<br>
<br>The legend of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a>, as told by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, has it that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> consulted the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oracle?lang=en'>Oracle</a> at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delphi?lang=en'>Delphi</a> before setting out to meet the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> army. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oracle?lang=en'>Oracle</a> is said to have made the following prophecy in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hexameter?lang=en'>hexameter</a> verse:
<br>
<br>O ye men who dwell in the streets of broad <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Lacedaemon</a>!
<br>Either your glorious town shall be sacked by the children of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Perseus_of_Macedon?lang=en'>Perseus</a>,
<br>Or, in exchange, must all through the whole <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Laconia?lang=en'>Laconian</a> country
<br>Mourn for the loss of a king, descendant of great <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heracles?lang=en'>Heracles</a>.
<br>He cannot be withstood by the courage of bulls nor of lions,
