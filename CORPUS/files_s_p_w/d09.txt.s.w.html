In the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> of 480 B.C.E. an alliance of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states fought the invading <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army at the pass of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>. Vastly outnumbered, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> delayed the enemy in one of the most famous last stands of history. A small force led by King <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> blocked the only road through which the massive army of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> could pass. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> succeeded in defeating the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> but sustained heavy losses, incredibly disproportionate to those of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. A local resident named <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ephialtes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephialtes_of_Trachis</b></span> betrayed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, revealing a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mountain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mountain_warfare</b></span> path that led behind the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> lines. Dismissing the rest of the army, King <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> stayed behind with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>300 Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span>, 400 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thebes,_Greece</b></span>, and 700 Thespian volunteers. Though they knew it meant their own deaths, they secured the retreat of the other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> forces.
<br>
<br>The losses of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army alarmed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>. When his navy was later defeated at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> he fled <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, leaving only part of his force to finish the conquest of the nation. That force was defeated at the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>. 
<br>
<br>The performance of the defenders at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> is often used as an example of the advantages of training, equipment, and good use of terrain to maximize an army's potential, as well as a symbol of courage against overwhelming odds. The heroic sacrifice of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thespians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thespiae</b></span> has captured the minds of many throughout the ages and has given birth to many cultural references as a result. Most of what historians know about the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> at this time, however, is through <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> and other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> sources. For the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were barbarians, culturally inferior and a threat to their ordered way of life. They tended to depict <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>effeminate</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Effeminacy</b></span>, over-fond of luxury, and, ultimately, no match for virtuous manly <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. 
<br>
<br>The Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> can be understood in terms of an us and them polarity that suggests an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>East-West dichotomy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>East–West_dichotomy</b></span>, with the West representing order, self-restraint, and freedom while the East represents the opposite. In this process, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> was an ideal person to be chosen as an example of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Asia</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>despotism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Despotism</b></span> and excessive <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hubris</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hubris</b></span>..
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>, king of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, had been preparing for years to continue the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> started by his father, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>. In 481 B.C.E., after four years of preparation, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army and navy arrived in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>. A <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>bridge</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bridge</b></span> of ships had been made at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Abydos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_recurring_alien_characters_in_Stargate_SG-1</b></span>. This allowed the land forces to cross the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> of Halicarnassus, who wrote the first history of this war, gave the size of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>' army as follows:
<br>
<br>This number needs to be nearly doubled in order to account for support troops, and thus <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> reports that the whole force numbered 5,283,220 men, a figure which has been rejected by modern historians. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>poet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Poetry</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Simonides</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Simonides_of_Ceos</b></span>, who was a near-contemporary, talks of four million. <span style='color: blue'><b>Ctesias</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cnidus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Knidos</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes Mnemon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia</b></span>'s personal <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>physician</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Physician</b></span>, wrote a history of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> according to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> sources that unfortunately has not survived, but gives 800,000 as the total number of the original army that met in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Doriskos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Doriscus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span>, after crossing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span>. Modern scholars have given different estimates based on knowledge of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> military systems, their logistical capabilities, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> countryside, and supplies available along the army's route.
<br>
<br>One school of thought rejects the figures given in ancient texts as exaggerations on the part of the victors. Based on analysis of the resources available to armies of the ancient era, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> force numbered between 60,000 and 120,000 combatants, plus a retinue of non-combatants, made larger because of the presence of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> king and high-ranking nobility. The upper limit was 250,000 total land forces. The main reason most often given for these values is a lack of water; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sir Frederick Maurice</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Frederick_Barton_Maurice</b></span><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Frederick Maurice</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Frederick_Barton_Maurice</b></span>al in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>World War I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>World_War_I</b></span>, was among the first to claim that the army could not have surpassed 175,000, due to lack of water.
<br>
<br>A second school contends that ancient sources do give realistic numbers. According to the texts, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> at the end of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> mustered 110,000 (<span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>) or 100,000 (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pompeius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pompey</b></span>) troops: 38,700 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> and 71,300 or 61,300 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>peltasts</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peltast</b></span> respectively, the difference probably being 10,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helots</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span>. In that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, they faced 300,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> and 50,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> allies. This gives a 3-to-1 ratio for the two armies, which proponents of the school consider a realistic proportion.
<br>
<br>Furthermore, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Munro</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Clan_Munro</b></span> and Macan argue for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>realism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Literary_realism</b></span> based on <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> giving the names of 6 major commanders and 29 μυρίαρχοι (muriarxoi)—leaders of the baivabaram, the basic unit of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> infantry, which numbered about 10,000 strong. As troops were lost through attrition, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> preferred to dissolve crippled baivabarams to replenish the ranks of others. Adding casualties of the battles and attrition due to the need to guard cities and strategic objectives yields a force of 400,000 minimum.
<br>
<br>According to this view, there was no lack of water. The available surface water in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> today satisfies the needs of a much larger population than the number of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>' troops, though the majority of that water is used for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>irrigation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Irrigation</b></span>. This thesis, however, overlooks the presence of the civilian population.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Nicholas Hammond</span> <span style='color: green'><b>N._G._L._Hammond</b></span> accepts 300,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>, though he claims that the numbers at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Doriskos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Doriscus</b></span> were smaller, without explaining how the change in numbers happened.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>metrologist</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Metrology</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Livio Catullo Stecchini</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Livio_Catullo_Stecchini</b></span> argues that <span style='color: blue'><b>Ctesias</b></span>'s figure of 800,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> troops for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army is accurate and that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s figure of 1,700,000 includes both <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> and support troops.
<br>
<br>Dr. Manousos Kampouris argues that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' 1,700,000 for the infantry plus 80,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> (including support) is realistic for various reasons, including the size of the area from which the army was drafted (from modern-day <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Libya</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Libya</b></span> to <span style='color: blue'><b>Pakistan</b></span>), the lack of security against spies, the ratios of land troops to fleet troops, of infantry to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> troops to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> troops.
<br>
<br>On the other hand, Christos Romas believes that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> troops accompanying <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> were a little over 400,000.
<br>
<br>To this number must be added 1,000 other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lacedemonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Laconia</b></span> mentioned by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Diodorus Siculus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Diodorus_Siculus</b></span> and perhaps 800 auxiliary troops from other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities. Diodorus gives 4,000 as the total of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> troops, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span> 11,200. Modern historians, who usually consider <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> more reliable, prefer his claim of 7,000 men.
<br>
<br>Why did <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> only bring 300 men? Apparently at the time there was a religious festival in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, and the soldiers, by law, were not allowed to travel. The only exception to this was <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>'s body guard of 300 men.
<br>
<br>After the expedition to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> was under way, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> sent messengers to all the states offering blandishments if they would submit and asking earth and water from their soil as a token of submission. Many smaller states submitted. The Athenians threw their envoys into a pit, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> threw theirs into a well, taunting them with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>retort</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Retort</b></span>, Dig it out for yourselves.
<br>
<br>Support gathered around these two leading states. A congress met at <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>late autumn</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Late_Autumn_(1960_film)</b></span> of 481 B.C.E., and a confederate alliance of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states was formed. It had the power to send envoys asking for assistance and to dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points after joint consultation. There is no evidence that any one state was in charge. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> calls them simply the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> or the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> who had banded together. The interests of all the states played a part in determining defensive strategy. Nothing else is known about the internal workings of the congress or the discussion during its proceedings.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army first encountered a joint force of 10,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and Spartan <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> led by Euanetus and <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> in the vale of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tempe</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vale_of_Tempe</b></span>. Upon hearing this, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> sent the army through the <span style='color: blue'><b>Sarantaporo</b></span> strait, which was <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>unguarded</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Unguarded_(Amy_Grant_album)</b></span>, and sidestepped them. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>, warned by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> I of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span>, vacated the pass. The allied <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> judged that the next strategic <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>choke point</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Choke_point</b></span> where the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army could be stopped was <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>. They decided to defend it as well as to send a fleet to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemision</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artemisium</b></span>, a naval <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>choke point</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Choke_point</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>' army was being supplied and supported by sea. Using the fleet they might also have crossed Maliacos bay and outflanked the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army again.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> high strategy is confirmed by an oration later in the same century:
<br>
<br>But while <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> showed these inclinations [to join the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>], the Athenians, for their part, embarked in their ships and hastened to the defence of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span>; while the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lacedaemonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sparta</b></span> and some of their allies went off to make a stand at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, judging that the narrowness of the ground would enable them to secure the passage.
<br>
<br>Some modern historians, such as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bengtson</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Jerry_Bengtson</b></span>, claim that the purpose of the land force was to slow down the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army while the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> navy was defeated at sea. Another theory is that the land army was to hold the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army in the north for as long as possible, and defeat it through attrition, epidemics, and food deprivation.
<br>
<br>Some have argued that the Athenians felt confident of the small force and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>' presence being enough to stop the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, otherwise they would have already vacated their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> and sent their whole army to <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>. Historians know of one case in which a small force did stop a larger invading force from the north; in 353 B.C.E./352 B.C.E. the Athenians managed to stop the forces of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Philip II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Philip_II_of_Macedon</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span> by deploying 5,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> and 400 horsemen.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> is quite clear on the subject. He says:
<br>
<br>The force with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> was sent forward by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> in advance of their main body, that the sight of them might encourage the allies to fight, and hinder them from going over to the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>, as was likely they might have done had they seen that <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> was backward. They intended presently, when they had celebrated the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Carneian Festival</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Carnea</b></span>, which was what now kept them at home, to leave a garrison in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, and hasten in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>full force</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Full_Force</b></span> to join the army. The rest of the allies intended to act similarly; for it happened that the Olympic Festival fell exactly at this same period. None of them looked to see the contest at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> decided so speedily; wherefore they were content to send forward a mere advance guard. Such accordingly were the intentions of the allies.
<br>
<br>The Spartan king was put in charge of the army at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>. Of his leadership, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> says only that they especially looked up to him. He was convinced that he was going to certain death, which he would not have been if he had thought the forces given him were adequate for a victory. He selected only men who had fathered sons that were old enough to take over the family responsibilities. <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> mentions in his Sayings of Spartan Women, that after encouraging her husband before his departure for the battlefield, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Gorgo</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gorgon</b></span>, the wife of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> asked him what she should do when he had left. To this he replied, Marry a good man and have good children.
<br>
<br>Another common saying of Spartan Women was, Come home with your shield or on it, meaning that the soldier was to return home either victorious (with your shield) or dead— carried away from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> field (on their shield), rather than fleeing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> and dropping their shield in cowardice (as it was too heavy a piece of armor to carry while running).
<br>
<br>At the time, the pass of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> consisted of a track along the shore of the Gulf of Malis so narrow that only one <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>chariot</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chariot</b></span> could pass through. On the southern side of the track stood the cliffs, while on the north side was the gulf. Along the path was a series of three constrictions, or gates (pylai), and at the center gate a short wall that had been erected by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phocians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis</b></span> in the previous century to aid in their defense against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thessalian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thessaly</b></span> invasions. The name hot gates comes from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hot springs</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hot_spring</b></span> that were located there.
<br>
<br>Today the pass is not that, but is inland, due to infilling of the Gulf of Malis. The old track appears at the foot of hills around the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Plain</b></span>, flanked by a modern road. It remains a natural defensive position to modern armies.
<br>
<br>When the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army reached the entrance to <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> instigated a council meeting. The Peloponnesians advised withdrawing to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>isthmus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Isthmus_of_Corinth</b></span> and defending only the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnese</b></span> there. They knew, of course, that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> would have to defeat <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> before they could arrive at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>isthmus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Isthmus_of_Corinth</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phocians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Locrians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Locris</b></span>, whose states were located nearby, becoming indignant, advised defending <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> and sending for more help. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> thought it best to adopt their plan.
<br>
<br>Meanwhile the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> entered the pass and sent a mounted scout to reconnoiter. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> allowed him to come up to the camp, observe them and depart. When the scout reported to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> the size of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> force, and that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> were indulging in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>calisthenics</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Calisthenics</b></span> and combing their long hair, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> found the reports laughable. Seeking the counsel of a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> in his employ, <span style='color: blue'><b>Demaratus</b></span>, he was told that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> were preparing for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> and that it was their custom to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>adorn</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_Middle-earth_rivers</b></span> their hair beforehand. They were the bravest men in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, he said, and they intended to dispute the pass.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> remained incredulous. According to another account, he did send emissaries to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> forces. At first he asked <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> to join him and offered him the kingship of all of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> answered, If you knew what is good in life, you would abstain from wishing for foreign things. For me it is better to die for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> than to be monarch over my compatriots.
<br>
<br>Then <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> asked him more forcefully to surrender their arms. To this <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> gave his noted answer, Μολών Λαβέ, which means Come take them. This quote has been repeated by many later generals and politicians, in order to express the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>' determination to risk a sacrifice rather than surrender without a fight. It is today the emblem of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>First Army</span> <span style='color: green'><b>First_United_States_Army</b></span> Corps.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> morale was high. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> wrote that when <span style='color: blue'><b>Dienekes</b></span>, a Spartan soldier, was informed that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> arrows would be so numerous as to blot out the sun, he remarked with characteristically laconic prose, So much the better, we shall fight in the shade. Today <span style='color: blue'><b>Dienekes</b></span>'s phrase is the motto of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>20th Armored Division</span> <span style='color: green'><b>20th_Armored_Division_(United_States)</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> waited four days for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> force to disperse. On the fifth day he ordered the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cissians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Khuzestan_Province</b></span> to take them prisoner and bring them before him.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> sent in the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span> at first perhaps because he preferred them for their bravery or perhaps, as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Diodorus Siculus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Diodorus_Siculus</b></span> suggested, because he wanted them to bear the brunt of the fighting—the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span> had been only recently conquered by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span> coming up to take the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> prisoner soon found themselves in a frontal assault. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> had camped on either side of the rebuilt <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phocian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis</b></span> wall. The fact that it was guarded shows that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> were using it to establish a reference line for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, but they fought in front of it.
<br>
<br>Details of the tactics are somewhat scant. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> probably deployed in a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span>, a wall of overlapping shields and layered spearpoints, spanning the entire width of the pass. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> says that the units for each state were kept together. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span>, armed with arrows and short spears, could not break through the long spears of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span>, nor were their lightly armored men a match for the superior armor, weaponry, and discipline of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>.
<br>
<br>And yet there are some indications they did not fight entirely in close formation. They made use of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>feint</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Feint</b></span> to draw the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span> in, pretending to retreat in disorder only to turn suddenly and attack the pursuing <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>. In this way they killed so many <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span> that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> is said to have started up off the seat from which he was watching the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> three times. According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Ctesias</b></span> the first wave numbered 10,000 soldiers and were commanded by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artapanus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artapanus_of_Alexandria</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The king then withdrew the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>. Having taken the measure of the enemy, he threw the best troops he had into a second assault: <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Immortals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_NCIS_episodes</b></span>, an elite corps of 10,000 men. On his side, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> had arranged a system of relays between the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> of the various cities so as to constantly have fresh troops on the front line. Yet in the heat of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> the units did not get a chance to rotate. Being able to approach the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> line only in such numbers as the space allowed, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Immortals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Immortality</b></span> succeeded no better than the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> had to withdraw them also. The first day of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> probably ended here.
<br>
<br>The assault failed again. The account of the slain gives some indication of why: The wall of bodies must have broken up the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> line and detracted from their morale. History judges them perhaps too harshly. Climbing over the bodies they could see that they had stepped into a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>killing machine</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Killing_Machine</b></span>, but the officers behind prevented them from withdrawing. The king at last stopped the assault and withdrew to his camp, totally perplexed. He now knew that a head-on confrontation against Spartan-led troops in a narrow place was the wrong approach.
<br>
<br>
<br>Late on the second day of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, as the king was pondering what to do next, he received a windfall circumstance: A Malian, named <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ephialtes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephialtes_of_Trachis</b></span>, informed him of a path around <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> and offered to guide them. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ephialtes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephialtes_of_Trachis</b></span> was motivated by the desire of a reward, though he was later assassinated.
<br>
<br>The path led from east of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> camp along the ridge of Mt. Anopaea behind the cliffs that flanked the pass. It branched, one path leading to <span style='color: blue'><b>Phocis</b></span>, and the other down to the Gulf of Malis at Alpenus, first town of <span style='color: blue'><b>Locris</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> had stationed 1000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phocian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis</b></span> volunteers on the heights to guard this path.
<br>
<br>For all their previous indignation and insistence on a defense at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, they were not prepared: There were no advance positions, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sentinels</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Factions_of_Halo</b></span> or patrols. Their first warning of the approach of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Immortals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Immortality</b></span> under <span style='color: blue'><b>Hydarnes</b></span> was the rustling of oak leaves at first light on the third day of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> says that they jumped up, suggesting that they were still asleep, and were greatly <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>amazed</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Amazed</b></span>, which no alert unit should have been.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Hydarnes</b></span> was as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>amazed</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Amazed</b></span> to see them hastily arming themselves. He feared that they were <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, but was enlightened by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ephialtes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephialtes_of_Trachis</b></span>. Not wishing to be delayed by an assault, <span style='color: blue'><b>Hydarnes</b></span> resorted to a tactic that later turned out to be the winning one: He fired showers of arrows at them. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phocians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis</b></span> retreated to the crest of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mountain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mountain_warfare</b></span>, there to make a last stand (their story). <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> branched left to Alpenus. For this act, the name of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ephialtes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephialtes_of_Trachis</b></span> received a lasting stigma: It means nightmare and is synonymous with traitor in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.
<br>
<br>None of the actions of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were a surprise to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>. From a variety of sources, he was kept apprised of their every move, receiving <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>intelligence</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Military_intelligence</b></span> of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> outflanking movement before first light.
<br>
<br>When <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> learned that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phocians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis</b></span> had not held, he called a council at dawn. During the council some <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> argued for withdrawal in the face of the overwhelming <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> advance, while others pledged to stay. After the council, many of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> forces did choose to withdraw. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> believed that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> blessed their departure with an order, but he also offered the alternate point of view: That those retreating forces departed without orders. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> had pledged themselves to fight to the death, while the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thebes,_Greece</b></span> were held as hostage against their will. However, a contingent of about 700 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thespians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thespiae</b></span>, led by general <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Demophilus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Demophilus_of_Thespiae</b></span>, the son of Diadromes, refused to leave with the other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, but cast their lot with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Ostensibly the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> were obeying their oath and following the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oracle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delphi</b></span> from <span style='color: blue'><b>Delphi</b></span>. However, it might also have been a calculated strategy to delay the advance of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> and cover the retreat of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army. In fact, with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> so close at hand, the decision to stand and fight was probably a tactical requirement, one made more palatable by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oracle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delphi</b></span>. The significance of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thespians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thespiae</b></span>' refusal to leave should not be ignored. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, as brave as their sacrifice indubitably was, were professional soldiers, trained from birth to be ready to give their lives in combat as Spartan law dictated. Conversely, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thespians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thespiae</b></span> were citizen-soldiers (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Demophilus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Demophilus_of_Thespiae</b></span>, for example, made his living as an architect) who elected to add whatever they could to the fight, rather than allow the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> to be annihilated alone. Though their bravery is often overlooked by history, it was most certainly not overlooked by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, who are said to have exchanged cloaks with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thespians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thespiae</b></span> and promised to be allies for eternity. At dawn <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> made libations. He paused to allow the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Immortals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Immortality</b></span> sufficient time to descend the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mountain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mountain_warfare</b></span>, and then began his advance.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> this time sallied forth from the wall to meet them in the wider part of the pass, in an attempt to slaughter as many as they could. They fought with spears until every spear was shattered and then switched to xiphoi (short swords). In this struggle <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> tells that two brothers of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> fell, <span style='color: blue'><b>Abrocomes</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Hyperanthes</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> also died in the assault.
<br>
<br>Receiving <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>intelligence</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Military_intelligence</b></span> that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ephialtes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephialtes_of_Trachis</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Immortals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Immortality</b></span> were coming up, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> withdrew and took a stand on a small hill behind the wall. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thebes,_Greece</b></span> under Leontiades put hands up, but a few were slain before the surrender was accepted. Some of the remaining <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> were fighting with their hands and teeth. Tearing down part of the wall, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> ordered the hill surrounded and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rained down arrows until the last <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> was dead. Archaeology has confirmed the arrow shower at the end.
<br>
<br>When the body of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> was recovered by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>, enraged at the loss of so many of his soldiers, ordered that the head be cut off, and the body <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>crucified</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Crucifixion</b></span>. This was very uncommon for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>: They had the habit of treating enemies that fought bravely against them with great honor, as the example of <span style='color: blue'><b>Pytheas</b></span> captured earlier, off <span style='color: blue'><b>Skyros</b></span> shows. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>, however, was known for his rages, as when he had the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> whipped because it would not obey him.
<br>
<br>After the departure and defeat of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> collected their dead and buried them on the hill. A stone lion was erected to commemorate <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>. Forty years after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>' body was returned from <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, where he was buried again with full honors and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>funeral games</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Funeral_games</b></span> were held every year.
<br>
<br>The simultaneous naval Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span> was a draw, whereupon the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> navy retreated. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> had control of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean Sea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> and all of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> as far south as <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>; the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> prepared to defend the Isthmus of <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>, while <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> sacked <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, whose inhabitants had already fled to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> Island. In September, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> defeated the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> at the naval Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>, which led to the rapid retreat of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The remaining</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Remaining</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army, left under the charge of <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>, was defeated in the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> by a combined <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army again led by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, under the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>regent</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Regent</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The legend of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, as told by <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, has it that <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> consulted the <span style='color: blue'><b>Oracle</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Delphi</b></span> before setting out to meet the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army. The <span style='color: blue'><b>Oracle</b></span> is said to have made the following prophecy in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hexameter</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hexameter</b></span> verse:
<br>
<br>O ye men who dwell in the streets of broad <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lacedaemon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sparta</b></span>!
<br>Either your glorious town shall be sacked by the children of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Perseus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Perseus_of_Macedon</b></span>,
<br>Or, in exchange, must all through the whole <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Laconian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Laconia</b></span> country
<br>Mourn for the loss of a king, descendant of great <span style='color: blue'><b>Heracles</b></span>.
<br>He cannot be withstood by the courage of bulls nor of lions,
<br>Strive as they may; he is mighty as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Jove</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_Ace_Attorney_characters</b></span>; there is naught that shall stay him,
<br>Till he have got for his prey your king, or your glorious <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>.
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>In essence</span> <span style='color: green'><b>In_Essence</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue'><b>Oracle</b></span>'s warning was that either <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>
