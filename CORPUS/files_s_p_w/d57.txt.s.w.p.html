<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> (/mɪlˈtaɪəˌdiːz/; <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>: Μιλτιάδης; c. 550 – 489 BC), also known as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> the Younger, was an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>History_of_Athens</a> citizen known mostly for his role in the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Battle_of_Marathon</a>, as well as for his downfall afterwards. He was the son of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cimon_Coalemos?lang=en'>Cimon_Coalemos</a>, a renowned Olympic <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chariot_racing?lang=en'>Chariot_racing</a>, and the father of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cimon?lang=en'>Cimon</a>, the noted <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>History_of_Athens</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Winston_Churchill?lang=en'>Winston_Churchill</a>.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> was a well-born <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>History_of_Athens</a>, and considered himself a member of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aeacidae?lang=en'>Aeacidae</a>,[1] as well as a member of the prominent <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philaidae?lang=en'>Philaidae</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clan?lang=en'>Clan</a>. He came of age during the tyranny of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peisistratos?lang=en'>Peisistratos</a>.
<br>
<br>His family was prominent, due in good part to their success with Olympic chariot-racing.[1][2] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> claimed that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cimon?lang=en'>Cimon</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a>' father, was known as "Coalemos", meaning "simpleton", because he had a reputation for being rough around the edges,[3] but whose 3 successive chariot-racing victories at the Olympics made him popular, so popular in fact that, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> claims, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peisistratos?lang=en'>Peisistratos</a> murdered him out of jealousy.[4]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> was named after his father's maternal half-brother, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> the Elder, who was also a victor at Olympic chariot-racing.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a>'s son <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cimon?lang=en'>Cimon</a> was a major <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>History_of_Athens</a> figure of the 470s and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/460s_BC?lang=en'>460s_BC</a>. His daughter <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elpinice?lang=en'>Elpinice</a> is remembered for her confrontations with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pericles?lang=en'>Pericles</a>, as recorded by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a>.
<br>
<br>Around <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/555_BC?lang=en'>555_BC</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> the Elder left <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>History_of_Athens</a> to establish a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colonies_in_antiquity?lang=en'>Colonies_in_antiquity</a> on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallipoli?lang=en'>Gallipoli</a> (now the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallipoli?lang=en'>Gallipoli</a>), setting himself up as a semi-autonomous <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tyrant?lang=en'>Tyrant</a> under the protection of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>History_of_Athens</a>.[5] Meanwhile, contrary to what one would expect from a man whose father was rumoured to have been murdered by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> leaders, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> the Younger rose through the ranks of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>History_of_Athens</a> to become eponymous <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archon?lang=en'>Archon</a> under the rule of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peisistratos?lang=en'>Peisistratos</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tyrant?lang=en'>Tyrant</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hippias?lang=en'>Hippias</a> in 524/23 BC.[6]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> the Elder was childless, so when he died around 520 BC,[7] his nephew, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> the Younger's brother, Stesagoras, inherited the tyranny of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallipoli?lang=en'>Gallipoli</a>. Four years later (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/516_BC?lang=en'>516_BC</a>), Stesagoras met his death by an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Axe?lang=en'>Axe</a> to the head,[8] so the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tyrant?lang=en'>Tyrant</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hippias?lang=en'>Hippias</a> sent <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> the Younger to claim his brother's lands.[9] Stesagoras' reign had been tumultuous, full of war and revolt. Wishing to achieve stronger control over his lands than his brother had, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> feigned mourning for his brother's death. When the men of rank from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallipoli?lang=en'>Gallipoli</a> came to console him, he imprisoned them. He then ensured his power by employing 500 troops. He also made an alliance with King <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Olorus?lang=en'>Olorus</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrace?lang=en'>Thrace</a> by marrying his daughter, Hegesipyle.[10]
<br>
<br>In around 513 BC, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a>, the king of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>, led a large army into the area, forcing the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallipoli?lang=en'>Gallipoli</a> into submission and making <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vassal?lang=en'>Vassal</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> rule. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> joined <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a>' northern expedition against the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythians?lang=en'>Scythians</a>, and was left with other <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> officers to guard a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Contract_bridge?lang=en'>Contract_bridge</a> across the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Danube?lang=en'>Danube</a>, which <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a> had used to cross into <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythians?lang=en'>Scythians</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> later claimed that he had tried to convince the other officers to destroy the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Contract_bridge?lang=en'>Contract_bridge</a> and leave <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a> and his forces to die, but the others were afraid, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a> was able to recross,[11] though some historians are skeptical of this claim.[12][13] When the king heard of the planned sabotage, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a>' rule became a perilous affair and he had to flee around 511/510 BC. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> joined the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionian_Revolt?lang=en'>Ionian_Revolt</a> of 499 BC against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> rule, returning to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallipoli?lang=en'>Gallipoli</a> around 496 BC. He established friendly relations with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>History_of_Athens</a> by capturing the islands of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lemnos?lang=en'>Lemnos</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Imbros?lang=en'>Imbros</a>, which he then ceded to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>History_of_Athens</a>, who had ancient claims to these lands.[14][15]
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionian_Revolt?lang=en'>Ionian_Revolt</a> collapsed in 494 BC, and in 492 BC <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> and his family fled to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>History_of_Athens</a> in five ships to escape a retaliatory <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> invasion.[n 1]
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>History_of_Athens</a> to which <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> returned was no longer a tyranny, but had overthrown the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peisistratos?lang=en'>Peisistratos</a> and become a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athenian_democracy?lang=en'>Athenian_democracy</a> 15 years earlier. Thus, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> initially faced a hostile reception for his tyrannical rule in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallipoli?lang=en'>Gallipoli</a>. His trial was further complicated by the politics of his aristocratic rivals (he came from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philaidae?lang=en'>Philaidae</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clan?lang=en'>Clan</a>, traditional rivals of the powerful <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alcmaeonidae?lang=en'>Alcmaeonidae</a>) and the general <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>History_of_Athens</a> mistrust of a man accustomed to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Unfettered_(anthology)?lang=en'>Unfettered_(anthology)</a> authority. However, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> successfully presented himself as a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Defendant?lang=en'>Defendant</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> freedoms against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Despotism?lang=en'>Despotism</a>. He also promoted the fact that he had been a first-hand witness to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> tactics, which was useful knowledge considering the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> were bent on destroying the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a>. Thus, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> escaped punishment and was allowed to rejoin his old countrymen.[17] It was by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a>' advice that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> heralds who came to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>History_of_Athens</a> to demand earth and water as tokens of submission were put to death.[18]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> is often credited with devising the tactics that defeated the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> at the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Battle_of_Marathon</a>.[19] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> was elected to serve as one of the ten generals (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strategos?lang=en'>Strategos</a>) for 490 BC. In addition to the ten generals, there was one 'war-ruler' (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polemarch?lang=en'>Polemarch</a>), <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Callimachus?lang=en'>Callimachus</a>, who had to decide—with the ten generals evenly split, five to five—whether to attack the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> who had landed at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Battle_of_Marathon</a>, or wait to fight them closer to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>History_of_Athens</a>.[20]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a>, the one with the most experience in fighting the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>, was firm in insisting that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> be fought immediately, as a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Siege?lang=en'>Siege</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>History_of_Athens</a> would lead to its destruction. He convinced <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Callimachus?lang=en'>Callimachus</a> to use his decisive vote in favor of a swift attack.[21][n 2] He is quoted as saying "I believe that, provided the Gods will give fair play and no favour, we are able to get the best of it in the engagement."[21]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> also convinced the other generals of the necessity of not using the customary tactics of using <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> arrayed in an evenly distributed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>Phalanx</a> armed with shields and spears, tactics otherwise not deviated from for 100 years, until the time of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epaminondas?lang=en'>Epaminondas</a>.[n 3] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> feared the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>Cavalry</a> of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> attacking the flanks, and asked for more <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> to be stationed there than in the centre.[24] He ordered the two tribes in the centre, the Leontis tribe led by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Antiochis?lang=en'>Antiochis</a> tribe led by Aristides, to be arrayed to a depth of four ranks while the rest of the tribes, on their flanks, were arrayed in eight ranks.[25][26] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> also had his men march to the end of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bow_and_arrow?lang=en'>Bow_and_arrow</a> range, called the "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Field_of_fire_(weaponry)?lang=en'>Field_of_fire_(weaponry)</a>", then break out in a run straight at the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> army.[24]
<br>
<br>These tactics were successful in defeating the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>, who then tried to sail around the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sounion?lang=en'>Sounion</a> and attack <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attica?lang=en'>Attica</a> from the west.[27] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> got his men to quickly march to the western side of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attica?lang=en'>Attica</a> overnight and block the two exits from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Plains?lang=en'>Great_Plains</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Battle_of_Marathon</a>, to prevent the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> moving inland. Datis fled at the sight of the soldiers who had just defeated him the previous evening.[27]
<br>
<br>One theory for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> success in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a> is the lack of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>Cavalry</a>. The theory is that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>Cavalry</a> left <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Battle_of_Marathon</a> for an unspecified reason, and that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> moved to take advantage of this by attacking. This theory is based on the absence of any mention of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>Cavalry</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>' account of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a>, and an entry in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suda?lang=en'>Suda</a> dictionary. The entry χωρίς ἰππεῖς ("without <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>Cavalry</a>") is explained thus:
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>Cavalry</a> left. When Datis surrendered and was ready for retreat, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionians?lang=en'>Ionians</a> climbed the trees and gave the Athenians the signal that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>Cavalry</a> had left. And when <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> realized that, he attacked and thus won. From there comes the above-mentioned quote, which is used when someone breaks ranks before <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a>.[28]
<br>
<br>The following year (489 BC), <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> led an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>History_of_Athens</a> expedition of seventy ships against the Greek-inhabited islands that were deemed to have supported the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>. The expedition was not a success. His true motivations were to attack <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paros?lang=en'>Paros</a>, feeling he had been slighted by them in the past.[29] The fleet attacked the island, which had been conquered by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>, but failed to take it. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> suffered a grievous leg wound during the campaign and became incapacitated. His failure prompted an outcry on his return to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>History_of_Athens</a>, enabling his political rivals to exploit his fall from grace. Charged with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treason?lang=en'>Treason</a>, he was sentenced to death, but the sentence was converted to a fine of fifty talents. He was sent to prison where he died, probably of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gangrene?lang=en'>Gangrene</a> from his wound. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Debt_(2010_film)?lang=en'>The_Debt_(2010_film)</a> was paid by his son <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cimon?lang=en'>Cimon</a>.[30]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phidias?lang=en'>Phidias</a> later erected a statue of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decepticon?lang=en'>Decepticon</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a>' honour, the deity whose job it was to bring sudden misfortune to those who had experienced an excess of fortune, in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greek_temple?lang=en'>Ancient_Greek_temple</a> of the goddess at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rhamnous?lang=en'>Rhamnous</a>. The statue was said to be made of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marble?lang=en'>Marble</a> provided by Datis for a memorial to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>
