Leonidas I "son of the lion";[1] died 11 August 480 BC) was a warrior king of the Greek city-state of Sparta. He was the husband of Gorgo, the daughter of Cleomenes I of Sparta[2] and the 17th of the Agiad line; a dynasty which claimed descent from the mythological demigod Heracles. <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas I</b></span> had a notable participation in the Second Persian War, where he led the allied Greek forces to a last stand at the Battle of Thermopylae (480 BC) while attempting to defend the pass from the invading Persian army.<p><p>According to Herodotus, <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas I</b></span>' mother was not only his father's wife but also his niece and had been barren for so long that the ephors, the five annually elected administrators of the Spartan constitution, tried to prevail upon King Anaxandridas II to set her aside and take another wife. <span style='color: green'><b>Anaxandridas II</b></span> refused, claiming his wife was blameless, whereupon the ephors agreed to allow him to take a second wife without setting aside his first. This second wife, a descendent of Chilon of Sparta (one of the Seven Sages of Greece), promptly bore a son, <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes I</b></span>. However, one year after <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes I</b></span>' birth, <span style='color: green'><b>Anaxandridas II</b></span>' first wife also gave birth to a son, Dorieus. <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas I</b></span> was the second son of <span style='color: green'><b>Anaxandridas II</b></span>' first wife, and either the elder brother or twin of Cleombrotus.[3] Because <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas I</b></span> was not heir to the throne, he was not exempt from attending the agoge, the public school education which the sons of all Spartans had to complete in order to qualify for citizenship.[4] <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas I</b></span> was thus one of the few Spartan kings to have ever undergone the notoriously harsh training of Spartan youth.[5]<p><p>King Anaxandridas II died in 520 BC,[6] and <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes I</b></span> succeeded to the throne sometime between then and 516 BC.[7] Dorieus was so outraged that the Spartans had preferred his half-brother over himself that he found it impossible to remain in Sparta. He made one unsuccessful attempt to set up a colony in Africa and, when this failed, sought his fortune in Sicily, where after initial successes he was killed.[8] <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas I</b></span>' relationship with his bitterly antagonistic elder brothers is unknown, but he married <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes I</b></span>' daughter, Gorgo, sometime before coming to the throne in 490 BC.[9]<p><p><span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas I</b></span> was heir to the Agiad throne and a full citizen (homoios) at the time of the Battle of Sepeia against Argos (c. 494 BC).[10] Likewise, he was a full citizen when the Persians sought submission from Sparta and met with vehement rejection in or around 492/491 BC. His elder brother, the king, had already been deposed on grounds of purported insanity, and had fled into exile when Athens sought assistance against the First Persian invasion of Greece, that ended at Marathon (490 BC).<p><p>Plutarch has recorded the following: "When someone said to him: 'Except for being king you are not at all superior to us,' <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas I</b></span> son of <span style='color: green'><b>Anaxandridas II</b></span> and brother of <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes I</b></span> replied: 'But were I not better than you, I should not be king.'"[11] As the product of the agoge, <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas I</b></span> is unlikely to have been referring to his royal blood alone but rather suggesting that he had, like his brother Dorieus, proven superior capability in the competitive environment of Spartan training and society, and that he believed this made him qualified to rule.<p><p><span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas I</b></span> was chosen to lead the combined Greek forces determined to resist the Second Persian invasion of Greece in 481 BC.[12] This was not simply a tribute to Sparta's military prowess: The probability that the coalition wanted <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas I</b></span> personally for his capability as a military leader is underlined by the fact that just two years after his death, the coalition preferred Athenian leadership to the leadership of either Leotychidas or <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas I</b></span>' successor (as regent for his still under-aged son) Pausanias. The rejection of Leotychidas and Pausanias was not a reflection on Spartan arms. Sparta's military reputation had never stood in higher regard, nor was Sparta less powerful in 478 BC than it had been in 481 BC.[12]<p><p>This selection of <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas I</b></span> to lead the defense of Greece against <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes I</b></span>' invasion led to <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas I</b></span>' death in the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC.[12]<p><p><span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas I</b></span> at Thermopylae (1814) by Jacques-Louis David, who chose the subject in the aftermath of the French Revolution as a model of "civic duty and self-sacrifice", but also as a contemplation of loss and death, with <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas I</b></span> quietly poised and heroically nude[13]<p>Upon receiving a request from the confederated Greek forces to aid in defending Greece against the Persian invasion, Sparta consulted the Oracle at Delphi. The Oracle is said to have made the following prophecy in hexameter verse:<p><p>For you, inhabitants of wide-wayed Sparta,<p>Either your great and glorious city must be wasted by Persian men,<p>Or if not that, then the bound of Lacedaemon must mourn a dead king, from Heracles' line.<p>The might of bulls or lions will not restrain him with opposing strength; for he has the might of Zeus.<p>I declare that he will not be restrained until he utterly tears apart one of these.[14]<p><p>In August 480 BC, <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas I</b></span> marched out of Sparta to meet <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes I</b></span>' army at Thermopylae with a small force of 1,200 men (900 helots and 300 Spartan hoplites), where he was joined by forces from other Greek city-states, who put themselves under his command to form an army of 7,000 strong. There are various theories on why <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas I</b></span> was accompanied by such a small force of hoplites. According to Herodotus, "the Spartans sent the men with <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas I</b></span> on ahead so that the rest of the allies would see them and march with no fear of defeat, instead of medizing like the others if they learned that the Spartans were delaying. After completing their festival, the Carneia, they left their garrison at Sparta and marched in full force towards Thermopylae. The rest of the allies planned to do likewise, for the Olympiad coincided with these events. They accordingly sent their advance guard, not expecting the war at Thermopylae to be decided so quickly."[15] Many modern commentators are unsatisfied with this explanation and point to the fact that the Olympic Games were in progress or impute internal dissent and intrigue.<p><p>Whatever the reason Sparta's own contribution was just 300 Spartiates (accompanied by their attendants and probably perioikoi auxiliaries), the total force assembled for the defense of the pass of Thermopylae came to something between four and seven thousand Greeks. They faced a Persian army who had invaded from the north of Greece under Xerxes I. Herodotus stated that this army consisted of over two million men; modern scholars consider this to be an exaggeration and give estimates ranging from 70,000 to 300,000.[16]<p><p><span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes I</b></span> waited four days to attack, hoping the Greeks would disperse. Finally, on the fifth day the Persians attacked. <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas I</b></span> and the Greeks repulsed the Persians' frontal attacks for the fifth and sixth days, killing roughly 10,000 of the enemy troops. The Persian elite unit known to the Greeks as "the Immortals" was held back, and two of <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes I</b></span>' brothers (Abrocomes and Hyperanthes) died in battle.[17] On the seventh day (August 11), a Malian Greek traitor named Ephialtes led the Persian general Hydarnes by a mountain track to the rear of the Greeks.[18] At that point <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas I</b></span> sent away all Greek troops and remained in the pass with his 300 Spartans, 900 helots, 400 Thebans and 700 Thespians. The Thespians stayed entirely of their own will, declaring that they would not abandon <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas I</b></span> and his followers. Their leader was Demophilus, son of Diadromes, and as Herodotus writes, "Hence they lived with the Spartans and died with them."<p><p>One theory provided by Herodotus is that <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas I</b></span> sent away the remainder of his men because he cared about their safety. The King would have thought it wise to preserve those Greek troops for future battles against the Persians, but he knew that the Spartans could never abandon their post on the battlefield. The soldiers who stayed behind were to protect their escape against the Persian cavalry. Herodotus himself believed that <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas I</b></span> gave the order because he perceived the allies to be disheartened and unwilling to encounter the danger to which his own mind was made up. He therefore chose to dismiss all troops except the Thebans, Thespians and helots and save the glory for the Spartans.[14]<p><p>Of the small Greek force, attacked from both sides, all were killed except for the 400 Thebans, who surrendered to <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes I</b></span> without a fight. When <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas I</b></span> was killed, the Spartans retrieved his body after driving back the Persians four times. Herodotus says that <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes I</b></span>' orders were to have <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas I</b></span>' head cut off and put on a stake and his body crucified. This was considered sacrilegious.[19]
