<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> (ruled 486-465 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>), also known as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> the Great, was the king of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> Achaemenid <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire?lang=en'>Empire</a>. His official title was <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_monarchs_of_Persia?lang=en'>Shahanshah</a> which, though usually translated as `emperor’, actually means `king of kings’. He is identified as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Ahasuerus</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persia</a> in the biblical Book of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Esther?lang=en'>Esther</a> (although his son, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia?lang=en'>Artaxerxes I</a>, is also a possibility as is <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia?lang=en'>Artaxerxes II</a>) and is referenced at length in the works of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diodorus_Siculus?lang=en'>Diodorus Siculus</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quintus_Curtius_Rufus?lang=en'>Quintus Curtius Rufus</a>, and, to a lesser extent, in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> is the primary source for the story of his expedition to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>. The name `<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>’ is the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> version of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> `Khshayarsa’ (or Khashyar <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_monarchs_of_Persia?lang=en'>Shah</a>), and so he is known in the west as `<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>’ but in the east as `Khshayarsa'.
<br>
<br>His mother was <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Atossa?lang=en'>Atossa</a>, the daughter of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Great?lang=en'>Cyrus</a> the Great (who founded the Achaemenid <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire?lang=en'>Empire</a>). He was, therefore, accepted as a great king before having to prove himself so in any way. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> is celebrated for his many building projects throughout his empire but is best known, in both ancient and modern sources, for the massive expedition he mounted against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> in 480 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> which, according to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, assembled the largest and most well equipped fighting force ever put into the field up to that point. He was the son of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius</a> the Great (550-486 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>) who, in an effort to punish <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> for their support of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionian</a> colonies' revolt against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> rule, had invaded <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> in 492 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Persians?lang=en'>The Persians</a> were defeated by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> forces at the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Marathon</a> in 490 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius</a> died in 486 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> before he could mount another offensive. It, therefore, fell to his son to carry out his father’s wishes and, in amassing an army of such size and strength, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> felt confident of his success in achieving what the great <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius</a> had been unable to realize.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> was not the eldest of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius</a>’ sons but, as the first-born of his marriage with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Atossa?lang=en'>Atossa</a>, was chosen as successor. Upon <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius</a>’ death, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>’ older half-brother, Artabazenes, claimed the throne but was rebuffed because his mother was a commoner while <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>’ mother was the daughter of the great <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Great?lang=en'>Cyrus</a>. He married the princess <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amestris?lang=en'>Amestris</a>, daughter of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otanes?lang=en'>Otanes</a>, who would become mother to his sons <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vishtaspa?lang=en'>Hystaspes</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia?lang=en'>Artaxerxes I</a>, Achamenes, and daughters <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amytis?lang=en'>Amytis</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rhodogune_of_Parthia?lang=en'>Rhodogune</a>.  Upon assuming the throne, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>’ <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Commander-in-chief?lang=en'>Commander-in-Chief</a> of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Army?lang=en'>Army</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mardonius?lang=en'>Mardonius</a> (who was also his cousin and brother-in-law), pressured him to renew the campaign against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mardonius?lang=en'>Mardonius</a>’ motives, it seems, were personal, as he hoped to rule the conquered nation as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satrap?lang=en'>Satrap</a> following <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>’ victory. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>’ uncle and advisor, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artabanus_of_Persia?lang=en'>Artabanus</a>, tried to persuade him to abandon the expedition but <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mardonius?lang=en'>Mardonius</a>’ arguments prevailed. Even so, there were many matters to attend to such as the insurrection of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon?lang=en'>Babylon</a> and the revolts against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> rule in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Egypt</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> expended considerable time throughout the year 485 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> in quelling these and restoring order.
<br>
<br>Although his grandfather <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Great?lang=en'>Cyrus</a> had been a friend to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon?lang=en'>Babylon</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> had subjugated the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> and melted down the golden statue of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marduk?lang=en'>Marduk</a>, their patron deity. This was a particular <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_civilisations_in_the_Culture_series?lang=en'>affront</a> to the dignity and tradition of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon?lang=en'>Babylon</a> because one of the religious duties of a ruler was to grasp the hands of the statue of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marduk?lang=en'>Marduk</a> at the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_Year?lang=en'>New Year</a>’s festival in order to ensure continued prosperity throughout the land; <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon?lang=en'>Babylon</a> thus enjoyed a prestige among the cities of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesopotamia?lang=en'>Mesopotamia</a> as the site of this ritual. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Great?lang=en'>Cyrus</a> had been diligent in officiating at the festival, as had <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius</a>, but <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> considered it a matter of little consequence. He ignored the established relationships with former allies, referring to himself as the King of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a>, and treated all as subject to his rule. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon?lang=en'>Babylon</a> revolted against him twice before he lay <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Siege?lang=en'>siege</a> to it and crushed the rebellion.
<br>
<br>With relative peace established in his empire, he again turned his attention to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> and conquest. He spent four years amassing enough supplies and weaponry for the campaign and also conscripting as many men as he could from various regions to ensure his victory. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> tells the story of Pythias the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lydia?lang=en'>Lydian</a> (a descendant of King <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Croesus?lang=en'>Croesus</a>) whose five sons were among those conscripted. Pythias hosted the king and his army lavishly at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sardis?lang=en'>Sardis</a> in the winter of 481-480 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> and offered to give <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> a considerable sum of money for the campaign, but <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> refused his offer and, instead, rewarded Pythias for his generosity by adding greatly to his treasury.
<br>
<br>Prior to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>’ departure for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dardanelles?lang=en'>Hellespont</a>, a bad <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Omen?lang=en'>omen</a> in the form of an eclipse appeared in the sky but <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>, assured by his diviners that it meant nothing, proceeded with his plans. Pythias, however, recognized the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Omen?lang=en'>omen</a> as a warning of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Impending_Doom_(American_band)?lang=en'>impending doom</a> and, emboldened by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>’ generosity and kindness, asked if his eldest son could be released from the army so that he would have at least one son to care for him in his old age and carry on as heir. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> became enraged at this request as it meant that Pythias doubted his chances of success. He had the eldest son removed from the ranks, cut him in half, placed the two sections of the corpse on either side of the road, and marched his troops away between them.
<br>
<br>According to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, the size of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>’ expeditionary force was over two million men and four thousand ships. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diodorus_Siculus?lang=en'>Diodorus Siculus</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quintus_Curtius_Rufus?lang=en'>Quintus Curtius Rufus</a> confirm the enormity of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>’ army, though their numbers differ from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> and from each other. In order to move his ships freely, he had a canal dug across the Isthmus of Actium near Mr. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mount_Athos?lang=en'>Athos</a>, the remains of which are still visible in the present day. He assembled his forces to cross the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dardanelles?lang=en'>Hellespont</a> into <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe?lang=en'>Europe</a> and, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> reports, watched them as they stood in formation. The size of the army and its majesty
<br>
<br>first gave <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> a feeling of deep self-satisfaction, but later he began to weep. When his uncle, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artabanus_of_Persia?lang=en'>Artabanus</a> (the one who had at first freely expressed his opinion and advised <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> not to attack <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>) noticed that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> was crying he said, `My lord, a short while ago you were feeling happy with your situation and now you are weeping. What a total change of mood!’ `Yes,” <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> answered. `I was reflecting on things and it occurred to me how short the sum total of human life is, which made me feel compassion. Look at all these people – but not one of them will still be alive in a hundred years’ time’(VII<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/.45_ACP?lang=en'>.45</a>-46).
<br>
<br>Even so, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> put the thoughts of the brevity of life from his mind and ordered the crossing and the invasion of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>.
<br>
<br>The omens, from the start, were not favorable to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>’ cause. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dardanelles?lang=en'>Hellespont</a> is said to have risen in revolt at his crossing. In order to move his massive force, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> built bridges across the water. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> writes:
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phoenicia?lang=en'>Phoenicians</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Egyptians</a> who had been assigned the task set about building their bridges (the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phoenicia?lang=en'>Phoenicians</a> using white <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flax?lang=en'>flax</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Egyptians</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Papyrus?lang=en'>papyrus</a>), taking <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abydos_(Hellespont)?lang=en'>Abydus</a> as their <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Starting_Point?lang=en'>starting point</a> and directing their efforts towards the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Headlands_and_bays?lang=en'>headland</a> on the opposite coast – a distance of seven <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stadion_(unit)?lang=en'>stades</a>. They had just finished bridging the straits when a violent storm erupted which completely smashed and destroyed everything. This news made <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> furious. He ordered his men to give the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dardanelles?lang=en'>Hellespont</a> three hundred lashes and to sink a pair of shackles into the sea. I once heard that they also dispatched men to brand the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dardanelles?lang=en'>Hellespont</a> as well. Be that as it may, he did tell the men he had thrashing the sea to revile it in terms you would never hear from a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a>. “Bitter water,” they said, this is your punishment for wronging your master when he did no wrong to you. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>King Xerxes</a><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>cross you, with or without your consent. People are right not to sacrifice to a muddy, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brackish_water?lang=en'>brackish</a> stream like you!” So the sea was punished at his orders and he had the supervisors of the bridging of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dardanelles?lang=en'>Hellespont</a> beheaded. The men assigned this grotesque task carried out their orders and another team of engineers managed to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bridge?lang=en'>bridge</a> the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dardanelles?lang=en'>Hellespont</a> (VII.34-36).
<br>
<br>Once they had reached the other side, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> writes, “a really extraordinary thing happened: a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>horse</a> gave birth to a hare. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> dismissed it as insignificant, though its meaning was transparent. It meant that, although <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> would walk tall and proud on his way to attack <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>, he would return to his starting-point running for his life” (VII.57). Besides the revolt of the waters of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dardanelles?lang=en'>Hellespont</a> and the appearance of the hare, there were other omens which indicated that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>’ campaign would end badly, but <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> dismissed all of them as meaningless and proceeded on toward his goal.
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>, in the meantime, had mobilized their forces under the direction of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> and sent forces to meet the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> expedition and defend the mainland. The battles of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Artemisium?lang=en'>Artemisium</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a>, fought more or less concurrently, provided the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> with victories (either complete or strategic) which enabled them access to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>, and they marched on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> as soon as they were able. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> was so enraged at the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athenian</a> resistance to his wishes that he burned the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> in a furious fit, which he so regretted that, later, he would reference this as his only remorse in the entire campaign.
<br>
<br>At this point, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>, who had abandoned <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> and most of the countryside, had gathered their forces off the coast of the mainland at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegina?lang=en'>Aegina</a> and in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnese?lang=en'>Peloponnese</a> and their navy was anchored in the straits of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Salamis</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> called a war council to decide on his next move and whether to engage the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Salamis</a>, return home content with the destruction of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>, or consider other alternatives. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mardonius?lang=en'>Mardonius</a> counseled in favor of a sea <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a>, as did all the other allied leaders, except for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artemisia_I_of_Caria?lang=en'>Artemisia</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caria?lang=en'>Caria</a> who provided <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> with other options. She claimed that he need do nothing to secure victory but keep the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> in place until their supplies ran out and they sued for peace. While he clearly respected <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artemisia_I_of_Caria?lang=en'>Artemisia</a> and thanked her for her advice, he chose the majority opinion and committed to the naval engagement.
<br>
<br>The Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Salamis</a>, which followed, was a disaster for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> fleet and cost <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> dearly. Following the loss, he again consulted <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artemisia_I_of_Caria?lang=en'>Artemisia</a> for advice and she told him he should return home and accept <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mardonius?lang=en'>Mardonius</a>’ offer to remain behind and conquer the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>’ name. This time he accepted her counsel and left the country with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mardonius?lang=en'>Mardonius</a> remaining behind to continue the war effort. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mardonius?lang=en'>Mardonius</a> was defeated the following year at the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Plataea?lang=en'>Plataea</a> which was fought on the same day as the equally decisive Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Mycale?lang=en'>Mycale</a>, 27 August 479 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mardonius?lang=en'>Mardonius</a> was killed and, with his death, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> forces scattered and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>’ ambitions for subjugating <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> were crushed. As the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Omen?lang=en'>omen</a> had predicted, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> returned home `limping’ with a fraction of his army and was forced to eat <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barque?lang=en'>bark</a>, weeds, and leaves because there was no food left in the regions they traveled through. The men were ravaged by disease and many died of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dysentery?lang=en'>dysentery</a> and so, by the time <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> crossed back across the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dardanelles?lang=en'>Hellespont</a> and reached <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sardis?lang=en'>Sardis</a>, he had hardly any army left to speak of.
<br>
<br>Back home, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> concentrated his efforts on making larger and grander monuments and completing greater building projects than his father. In doing so, he depleted the royal treasury to an even greater extent than his expedition to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> already had.  He maintained the roadways throughout the empire, especially the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Royal_Road?lang=en'>Royal Road</a> by which messages were carried (the precursor to the Roman mail system and, later, the modern-day <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mail?lang=en'>postal system</a>) and devoted both time and funds to expanding sites such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susa?lang=en'>Susa</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persepolis?lang=en'>Persepolis</a>. Although <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius</a>’ palace still stood, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>’ commissioned an even more elaborate building project to raise his own opulent palace nearby and also commanded the construction of the Hall of a Hundred Columns and the building which has been designated `The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harem?lang=en'>Harem</a>’ by archaeologists (because of the duplication of identical rooms in a row) which may have actually served as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>’ treasury. The exorbitant cost of these projects, coupled with the expense of the expedition to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>, put a tremendous strain on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>' subjects through heavy taxation. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>, however, appeared not to notice a problem and continued to do as he pleased; because of this, his rule marks the beginning of the decline of the Achaemenid <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire?lang=en'>Empire</a>.
<br>
<br>According to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>’ fondness for women and lack of restraint led to his pursuit of his brother <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Masistes?lang=en'>Masistes</a>’ wife. When she refused him, he married one of his sons, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius</a>, to the daughter of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Masistes?lang=en'>Masistes</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaynte?lang=en'>Artaynte</a>, in hopes that, by this union, he could get closer to his brother’s wife and manage to seduce her. When he saw <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaynte?lang=en'>Artaynte</a>, however, he desired her more than the mother and, when he approached her, she agreed to an affair. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> reports that, at about this same time, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>’ wife <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amestris?lang=en'>Amestris</a> had woven him a beautiful <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shawl?lang=en'>shawl</a>, which he liked so much he wore everywhere. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaynte?lang=en'>Artaynte</a> admired the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shawl?lang=en'>shawl</a> and, one day when <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> told her that he would give her any gift she asked for, she requested the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shawl?lang=en'>shawl</a>. He tried to get her to take any other gift instead because he knew that, should he give his mistress the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shawl?lang=en'>shawl</a>, his wife would discover the affair. He had given his word, however, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaynte?lang=en'>Artaynte</a> refused any other gift, and so he gave her the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shawl?lang=en'>shawl</a>.
<br>
<br>As he feared, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amestris?lang=en'>Amestris</a> heard that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>’ mistress was wearing the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shawl?lang=en'>shawl</a> and plotted revenge. She decided to focus her energies, not on the mistress, but on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaynte?lang=en'>Artaynte</a>’ s mother who she blamed for not raising a proper daughter (and, perhaps, because she had guessed that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaynte?lang=en'>Artaynte</a> was <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>’ second choice in a mistress). At the royal banquet known as Tukta, which was held once a year and at which the king granted gifts to his subjects, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amestris?lang=en'>Amestris</a> asked for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Masistes?lang=en'>Masistes</a>’ wife to be delivered to her. As with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaynte?lang=en'>Artaynte</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shawl?lang=en'>shawl</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> pleaded with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amestris?lang=en'>Amestris</a> to make any other request, but she would not do so.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> then gave his brother’s wife to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amestris?lang=en'>Amestris</a> who, according to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, “sent for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>’ personal guards and with their help mutilated <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Masistes?lang=en'>Masistes</a>’ wife. She cut off her breasts and threw them to the dogs, cut off her nose, ears, lips, and tongue, and then sent her back home totally disfigured” (9:112). In response, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Masistes?lang=en'>Masistes</a> tried to raise a revolt in Bactra but <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>, hearing of his plans, trapped him and killed him, his sons, and all of the men he had rallied to his cause. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> then returned to his building projects and designs for greater, grander, monuments to commemorate his reign and distinguish him from his father.  His development plans were cut short through his assassination by his minister <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artabanus_of_Persia?lang=en'>Artabanus</a> (a different man than his uncle of the same name) who also murdered his son <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>’ other son, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia?lang=en'>Artaxerxes I</a>, then killed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artabanus_of_Persia?lang=en'>Artabanus</a>, took the throne, and went on to complete <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>
