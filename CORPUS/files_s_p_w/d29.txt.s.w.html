<span style='color: blue'><b>Delphi</b></span> was an important <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ancient Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> religious sanctuary sacred to the god <span style='color: blue'><b>Apollo</b></span>. Located on Mt. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Parnassus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mount_Parnassus</b></span> near the Gulf of <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span>, the sanctuary was home to the famous <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oracle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delphi</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Apollo</b></span> which gave cryptic predictions and guidance to both city-states and individuals. In addition, <span style='color: blue'><b>Delphi</b></span> was also home to the panhellenic <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pythian Games</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pythian_Games</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The site was first settled in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycenaean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mycenaean_Greece</b></span> times in the late <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bronze Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bronze_Age</b></span> (1500-1100 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>) but took on its religious significance from around 800 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. The original name of the sanctuary was <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pytho</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delphi</b></span> after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>snake</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Snake</b></span> which <span style='color: blue'><b>Apollo</b></span> was believed to have killed there. Votive offerings at the site from this period include small <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>clay</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pottery</b></span> statues (the earliest), bronze figurines, and richly decorated bronze tripods.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Delphi</b></span> was also considered the centre of the world, for in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek mythology</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_mythology</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Zeus</b></span> released two eagles, one to the east and another to the west, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Delphi</b></span> was the point at which they met after encircling the world. This fact was represented by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>omphalos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Omphalos</b></span> (or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>navel</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Omphalos</b></span>), a dome-shaped stone which stood outside <span style='color: blue'><b>Apollo</b></span>’s <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_temple</b></span> and which also marked the spot where <span style='color: blue'><b>Apollo</b></span> killed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Python</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pythonidae</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The oracle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Oracle_(The_Matrix)</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Apollo</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Delphi</b></span> was famed throughout the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> world and even beyond. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The oracle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Oracle_(The_Matrix)</b></span> - the Pythia or priestess - would answer questions put to her by visitors wishing to be guided in their future actions. The whole process was a lengthy one, usually taking up a whole day and only carried out on specific days of the year. First the priestess would perform various actions of purification such as washing in the nearby <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Castalian Spring</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Castalian_Spring</b></span>, burning laurel leaves, and drinking <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>holy water</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Holy_water</b></span>. Next an animal - usually a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>goat</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Goat</b></span> - was sacrificed. The party seeking advice would then offer a pelanos - a sort of pie - before being allowed into the inner <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_temple</b></span> where the priestess resided and gave her pronouncements, possibly in a drug or natural gas-induced state of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ecstasy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Religious_ecstasy</b></span>. 
<br>
<br>Perhaps the most famous consultant of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delphic oracle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delphi</b></span> was <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span>, the fabulously <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>rich King</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Rich_King_(sportscaster)</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span> who, faced with a war against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, asked the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oracle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delphi</b></span>’s advice. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The oracle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Oracle_(The_Matrix)</b></span> stated that if <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span> went to war then a great empire would surely fall. Reassured by this, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> king took on the mighty <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>. However, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> were routed at <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> and it was the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> which fell, a lesson that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oracle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delphi</b></span> could easily be misinterpreted by the unwise or over-confident.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Delphi</b></span>, as with the other major religious sites of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Opel_Olympia</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Nemea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nemean_Games</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Isthmia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Isthmian_Games</b></span>, held games to honour various gods of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek religion</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_religion</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pythian Games</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pythian_Games</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Delphi</b></span> began sometime between 591 and 585 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> and were initially held every eight years, with the only event being a musical competition where solo singers accompanied themselves on a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>kithara</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cithara</b></span> to sing a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hymn</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hymn</b></span> to <span style='color: blue'><b>Apollo</b></span>. Later, more musical contests and athletic events were added to the programme, and the games were held every four years with only the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympic Games</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Olympic_Games</b></span> being more important. The principal prize for victors in the Games was a crown of laurel or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>bay leaves</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Laurus_nobilis</b></span>.  
<br>
<br>The site and games were managed by the independent <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delphic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pythia</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>amphictiony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Amphictyonic_League</b></span> - a council with representatives from various nearby city-states - which levied taxes, collected offerings, invested in construction programmes, and even organised military campaigns in the Four <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sacred Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Sacred_Wars</b></span>, fought to redress sacrilegious acts against <span style='color: blue'><b>Apollo</b></span> perpetrated by the states of Crisa, <span style='color: blue'><b>Phocis</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Amphissa</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Amfissa</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_temple</b></span> in the area was built in the 7th century <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> and was itself a replacement for less substantial buildings of worship which had stood before it. The focal point of the sanctuary, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Doric</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dorians</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_temple</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Apollo</b></span>, was unfortunately destroyed by fire in 548 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. A second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_temple</b></span>, again <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Doric</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dorians</b></span> in style, was completed in c. 510 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> with the help of the exiled <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> family, the Alcmeonids. Measuring some 60 by 24 metres, the facade had six columns whilst the sides had 15. This <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_temple</b></span> was destroyed by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>earthquake</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Earthquake</b></span> in 373 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> and was replaced by a similarly proportioned <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_temple</b></span> in 330 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. This was constructed with poros stone coated in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>stucco</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Stucco</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marble sculpture</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Marble_sculpture</b></span> was also added as decoration along with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> shields taken at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>. This is the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_temple</b></span> which survives, albeit only partially, today.  
<br>
<br>Other notable constructions at the site were the theatre (with capacity for 5,000 spectators), temples to <span style='color: blue'><b>Athena</b></span> (4th century <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>), a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tholos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Beehive_tomb</b></span> with 13 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Doric</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dorians</b></span> columns (c. 580 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>), stoas, stadium (with capacity for 7,000 spectators), and around 20 treasuries, which were constructed to house the votive offerings and dedications from city-states all over <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. Similarly, monuments were also erected to commemorate military victories and other important events. For example, the Spartan general <span style='color: blue'><b>Lysander</b></span> erected a monument to celebrate his victory over <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegospotami</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Aegospotami</b></span>. Other notable monuments were the great bronze Bull of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corcyra</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corfu</b></span> (580 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>), the ten statues of the kings of <span style='color: blue'><b>Argos</b></span> (c. 369 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>), a gold four-horse <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>chariot</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chariot</b></span> offered by Rhodes, and a huge bronze statue of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Trojan Horse</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Trojan_Horse</b></span> offered by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Argives</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Argos</b></span> (c.413 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>). Lining the sacred way, which wound from the sanctuary gate up to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_temple</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Apollo</b></span>, the visitor must have been greatly impressed by the artistic and literal wealth on display. Alas, in most cases, only the monumental pedestals survive of these great statues, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>silent witnesses</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Silent_Witnesses</b></span> to a lost grandeur.
<br>
<br>In 480 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> attacked the sanctuary and in 279 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> the sanctuary was again attacked, this time by the <span style='color: blue'><b>Gauls</b></span>. It was during the 3rd century <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> that the site came under the control of the Aitolian League. In 191 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Delphi</b></span> passed into Roman hands; however, the sanctuary and the games continued to be culturally important in Roman times, in particular under <span style='color: blue'><b>Hadrian</b></span>. The decree by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Theodosius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Theodosius_I</b></span> in 393 CE to close all <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pagan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Religion_in_ancient_Rome</b></span> sanctuaries resulted in <span style='color: blue'><b>Delphi</b></span>’s gradual decline. A <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Christian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Christianity</b></span> community dwelt at the site for several centuries until its final abandonment in the 7th century CE.
<br>
<br>The site was ‘re-discovered’ with the first modern excavations being carried out in 1880 CE by a team of French archaeologists. Notable finds were splendid <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>metope</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Metope</b></span> sculptures from the treasury of the Athenians (c. 490 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>) and the Siphnians (c. 525 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>) depicting scenes from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek mythology</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_mythology</b></span>.  In addition, a bronze charioteer in the severe style (480-460 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>), the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>marble</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Marble</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Sphinx</b></span> of the Naxians (c. 560 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>), the twin <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>marble</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Marble</b></span> archaic statues - the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>kouroi</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kouros</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Argos</b></span> (c. 580 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>) and the richly decorated <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>omphalos stone</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Omphalos</b></span> (c. 330 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>) - all survive as testimony to the cultural and artistic wealth that <span style='color: blue'><b>Delphi</b></span>
