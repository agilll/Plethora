<span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> (/mɪlˈtaɪəˌdiːz/; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>: Μιλτιάδης; c. 550 – 489 BC), also known as <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> the Younger, was an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> citizen known mostly for his role in the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, as well as for his downfall afterwards. He was the son of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cimon Coalemos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cimon_Coalemos</b></span>, a renowned Olympic <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>chariot-racer</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chariot_racing</b></span>, and the father of <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span>, the noted <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>statesman</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Winston_Churchill</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> was a well-born <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, and considered himself a member of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeacidae</b></span>,[1] as well as a member of the prominent <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Philaid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Philaidae</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>clan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Clan</b></span>. He came of age during the tyranny of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peisistratids</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peisistratos</b></span>.
<br>
<br>His family was prominent, due in good part to their success with Olympic chariot-racing.[1][2] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> claimed that <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span>' father, was known as "Coalemos", meaning "simpleton", because he had a reputation for being rough around the edges,[3] but whose 3 successive chariot-racing victories at the Olympics made him popular, so popular in fact that, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> claims, <span style='color: blue'><b>Peisistratos</b></span> murdered him out of jealousy.[4]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> was named after his father's maternal half-brother, <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> the Elder, who was also a victor at Olympic chariot-racing.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span>'s son <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span> was a major <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> figure of the 470s and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>460s BC</span> <span style='color: green'><b>460s_BC</b></span>. His daughter <span style='color: blue'><b>Elpinice</b></span> is remembered for her confrontations with <span style='color: blue'><b>Pericles</b></span>, as recorded by <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Around <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>555 BC</span> <span style='color: green'><b>555_BC</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> the Elder left <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> to establish a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>colony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Colonies_in_antiquity</b></span> on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thracian Chersonese</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gallipoli</b></span> (now the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Gallipoli Peninsula</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gallipoli</b></span>), setting himself up as a semi-autonomous <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> under the protection of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>.[5] Meanwhile, contrary to what one would expect from a man whose father was rumoured to have been murdered by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> leaders, <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> the Younger rose through the ranks of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> to become eponymous <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>archon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archon</b></span> under the rule of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peisistratid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peisistratos</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span> in 524/23 BC.[6]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> the Elder was childless, so when he died around 520 BC,[7] his nephew, <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> the Younger's brother, Stesagoras, inherited the tyranny of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chersonese</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gallipoli</b></span>. Four years later (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>516 BC</span> <span style='color: green'><b>516_BC</b></span>), Stesagoras met his death by an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>axe</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Axe</b></span> to the head,[8] so the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span> sent <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> the Younger to claim his brother's lands.[9] Stesagoras' reign had been tumultuous, full of war and revolt. Wishing to achieve stronger control over his lands than his brother had, <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> feigned mourning for his brother's death. When the men of rank from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chersonese</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gallipoli</b></span> came to console him, he imprisoned them. He then ensured his power by employing 500 troops. He also made an alliance with King <span style='color: blue'><b>Olorus</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span> by marrying his daughter, Hegesipyle.[10]
<br>
<br>In around 513 BC, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>, the king of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, led a large army into the area, forcing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thracian Chersonese</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gallipoli</b></span> into submission and making <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vassal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vassal</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule. <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> joined <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>' northern expedition against the <span style='color: blue'><b>Scythians</b></span>, and was left with other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> officers to guard a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>bridge</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Contract_bridge</b></span> across the <span style='color: blue'><b>Danube</b></span>, which <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> had used to cross into <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Scythia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Scythians</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> later claimed that he had tried to convince the other officers to destroy the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>bridge</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Contract_bridge</b></span> and leave <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> and his forces to die, but the others were afraid, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> was able to recross,[11] though some historians are skeptical of this claim.[12][13] When the king heard of the planned sabotage, <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span>' rule became a perilous affair and he had to flee around 511/510 BC. <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> joined the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> of 499 BC against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule, returning to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chersonese</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gallipoli</b></span> around 496 BC. He established friendly relations with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> by capturing the islands of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lemnos</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Imbros</b></span>, which he then ceded to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, who had ancient claims to these lands.[14][15]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> collapsed in 494 BC, and in 492 BC <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> and his family fled to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> in five ships to escape a retaliatory <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion.[n 1]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> to which <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> returned was no longer a tyranny, but had overthrown the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peisistratids</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peisistratos</b></span> and become a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span> 15 years earlier. Thus, <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> initially faced a hostile reception for his tyrannical rule in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thracian Chersonese</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gallipoli</b></span>. His trial was further complicated by the politics of his aristocratic rivals (he came from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Philaid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Philaidae</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>clan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Clan</b></span>, traditional rivals of the powerful <span style='color: blue'><b>Alcmaeonidae</b></span>) and the general <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> mistrust of a man accustomed to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>unfettered</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Unfettered_(anthology)</b></span> authority. However, <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> successfully presented himself as a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>defender</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Defendant</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> freedoms against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>despotism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Despotism</b></span>. He also promoted the fact that he had been a first-hand witness to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> tactics, which was useful knowledge considering the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were bent on destroying the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>. Thus, <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> escaped punishment and was allowed to rejoin his old countrymen.[17] It was by <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span>' advice that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> heralds who came to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> to demand earth and water as tokens of submission were put to death.[18]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> is often credited with devising the tactics that defeated the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>.[19] <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> was elected to serve as one of the ten generals (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>strategoi</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Strategos</b></span>) for 490 BC. In addition to the ten generals, there was one 'war-ruler' (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>polemarch</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Polemarch</b></span>), <span style='color: blue'><b>Callimachus</b></span>, who had to decide—with the ten generals evenly split, five to five—whether to attack the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> who had landed at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, or wait to fight them closer to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>.[20]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span>, the one with the most experience in fighting the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, was firm in insisting that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> be fought immediately, as a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> would lead to its destruction. He convinced <span style='color: blue'><b>Callimachus</b></span> to use his decisive vote in favor of a swift attack.[21][n 2] He is quoted as saying "I believe that, provided the Gods will give fair play and no favour, we are able to get the best of it in the engagement."[21]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> also convinced the other generals of the necessity of not using the customary tactics of using <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> arrayed in an evenly distributed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> armed with shields and spears, tactics otherwise not deviated from for 100 years, until the time of <span style='color: blue'><b>Epaminondas</b></span>.[n 3] <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> feared the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> attacking the flanks, and asked for more <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> to be stationed there than in the centre.[24] He ordered the two tribes in the centre, the Leontis tribe led by <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue'><b>Antiochis</b></span> tribe led by Aristides, to be arrayed to a depth of four ranks while the rest of the tribes, on their flanks, were arrayed in eight ranks.[25][26] <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> also had his men march to the end of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>archer</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bow_and_arrow</b></span> range, called the "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>beaten zone</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Field_of_fire_(weaponry)</b></span>", then break out in a run straight at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army.[24]
<br>
<br>These tactics were successful in defeating the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, who then tried to sail around the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cape Sounion</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sounion</b></span> and attack <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span> from the west.[27] <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> got his men to quickly march to the western side of <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span> overnight and block the two exits from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Great_Plains</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, to prevent the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> moving inland. Datis fled at the sight of the soldiers who had just defeated him the previous evening.[27]
<br>
<br>One theory for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> success in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> is the lack of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>. The theory is that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> left <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> for an unspecified reason, and that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> moved to take advantage of this by attacking. This theory is based on the absence of any mention of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' account of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, and an entry in the <span style='color: blue'><b>Suda</b></span> dictionary. The entry χωρίς ἰππεῖς ("without <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>") is explained thus:
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> left. When Datis surrendered and was ready for retreat, the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> climbed the trees and gave the Athenians the signal that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> had left. And when <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> realized that, he attacked and thus won. From there comes the above-mentioned quote, which is used when someone breaks ranks before <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>.[28]
<br>
<br>The following year (489 BC), <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> led an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> expedition of seventy ships against the Greek-inhabited islands that were deemed to have supported the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. The expedition was not a success. His true motivations were to attack <span style='color: blue'><b>Paros</b></span>, feeling he had been slighted by them in the past.[29] The fleet attacked the island, which had been conquered by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, but failed to take it. <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> suffered a grievous leg wound during the campaign and became incapacitated. His failure prompted an outcry on his return to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, enabling his political rivals to exploit his fall from grace. Charged with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>treason</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Treason</b></span>, he was sentenced to death, but the sentence was converted to a fine of fifty talents. He was sent to prison where he died, probably of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>gangrene</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gangrene</b></span> from his wound. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The debt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Debt_(2010_film)</b></span> was paid by his son <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span>.[30]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pheidias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phidias</b></span> later erected a statue of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Nemesis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Decepticon</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span>' honour, the deity whose job it was to bring sudden misfortune to those who had experienced an excess of fortune, in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_temple</b></span> of the goddess at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Rhamnus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Rhamnous</b></span>. The statue was said to be made of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>marble</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Marble</b></span> provided by Datis for a memorial to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>
