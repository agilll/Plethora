<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> (c. 550-486 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>), also known as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> the Great, was the third <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> King of the Achaemenid <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire?lang=en'>Empire</a>. His reign lasted 36 years, from c. 522 to 486 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>; during this time the Persian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire?lang=en'>Empire</a> reached its peak. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> led military campaigns in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe?lang=en'>Europe</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>, and even in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indus_River?lang=en'>Indus</a> valley, conquering lands and expanding his empire. Not only resuming to military prowess, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> also improved the legal and economic system and conducted impressive construction projects across the Persian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire?lang=en'>Empire</a>.
<br>
<br>The most important primary sources, that tell us about his life and reign, are his inscriptions, the most famous example being the trilingual inscription, in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Akkadian_language?lang=en'>Akkadian</a> or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon?lang=en'>Babylonian</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elamite_language?lang=en'>Elamite</a>, and old <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a>, carved on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Behistun_Inscription?lang=en'>Bisitun</a> (Behistun) <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rock_relief?lang=en'>rock relief</a> from the village of the same name and from his palace at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persepolis?lang=en'>Persepolis</a>. Also, accounts about his reign were chronicled by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> historian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> was born in c. 550 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>, the oldest son of Hystapes and Rhodugune. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Behistun_Inscription?lang=en'>Behistun inscription</a> mentions that his father occupied the position of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satrap?lang=en'>satrap</a> (regional leader) of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bactria?lang=en'>Bactria</a> and Persis during the reign of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Great?lang=en'>Cyrus</a> the Great (559-530 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>) and his son, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_II?lang=en'>Cambyses II</a> (530-522 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>). During the reign of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_II?lang=en'>Cambyses II</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> held the position of spearman (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doryphoros?lang=en'>doryphoros</a>)  and accompanied the king in his campaign to Egypt between 528 and 525 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>. Before leaving for Egypt, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_II?lang=en'>Cambyses II</a> named Patizithes as custodian of the royal palace in his absence. Patizithes saw this situation as an opportunity to gain power. He set up his own brother, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bardiya?lang=en'>Gaumata</a>, as a false king under the name of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bardiya?lang=en'>Bardiya</a> or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bardiya?lang=en'>Smerdis</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_II?lang=en'>Cambyses II</a>' brother, becoming the new ruler in 522 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_II?lang=en'>Cambyses II</a> returned to his country seven months later only to find that he could not take his throne back. Some historical sources say he took his own life as he was unable to defeat the impostor king and his supporters, while other tell us he fell during the marches through <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Syria?lang=en'>Syrian</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ecbatana?lang=en'>Ecbatana</a> or through <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Damascus?lang=en'>Damascus</a>.
<br>
<br>The false king’s reign did not last long. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> tells us that Phaedymia, the daughter of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_II?lang=en'>Cambyses II</a>' uncle, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otanes?lang=en'>Otanes</a>, found out that the ruler is not <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_II?lang=en'>Cambyses II</a>' brother. Her father, after learning the truth, quickly assembled a group of conspirators which included <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hydarnes?lang=en'>Hydarnes</a>, Intaphrenes, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Megabyzus?lang=en'>Megabyzus</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a>, who at the time was still the king’s <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lancer?lang=en'>lancer</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bardiya?lang=en'>Gaumata</a> was finally assassinated, leaving the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> empire without a leader; the conspirators had to decide the future of the empire. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otanes?lang=en'>Otanes</a> opted out, wanting only special privileges for his family, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oligarchy?lang=en'>oligarchy</a> was suggested by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Megabyzus?lang=en'>Megabyzus</a>, while <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> voted for a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monarchy?lang=en'>monarchy</a>. Being unable to settle the matter at hand, all of them agreed on a contest, where the winner would take the throne. All of them would meet the next morning, each on his <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>horse</a>, and the first <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>horse</a> to neigh at the sunrise would be named the new king. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> tells us that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> cheated; supposedly it was his servant, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oebares?lang=en'>Oebares</a>, who made the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>horse</a> neigh by letting the animal smell his hand that he had previously rubbed over the genitals of a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse?lang=en'>mare</a>. In any case, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>horse</a>'s neigh accompanied by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lightning?lang=en'>lightning</a> and thunder from a storm convinced the others to accept <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> as the new king in 522 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>.
<br>
<br>Even though <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bardiya?lang=en'>Gaumata</a> was a false ruler, only a portion of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satrap?lang=en'>satrapies</a> recognised <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> as their king, after his coronation, in 522 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>, such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bactria?lang=en'>Bactria</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arachosia?lang=en'>Arachosia</a>. Others saw the false king's death as a chance for independence. Revolts broke out across many regions of the empire, including Persis, Media, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parthia?lang=en'>Parthia</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon?lang=en'>Babylon</a>, and Egypt, and only with aid of his army and personal entourage did <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> manage to quell these conflicts. These events are chronicled in great detail in his inscriptions, translated by Herbert <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_B._Cushing?lang=en'>Cushing</a>, which also serve as a warning for future kings:
<br>
<br>Says <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> the king: O thou who shalt be king in
<br>the future, protect thyself strongly from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deception?lang=en'>Deceit</a>;
<br>whatever man shall be a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Foreigner_universe?lang=en'>deceiver</a>, him who deserves
<br>to be punished, punish, if thus thou shalt think " may
<br>my country be secure." 
<br>
<br>Says <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> the king: O thou who shalt be
<br>king in the future, whatever man shall be a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Foreigner_universe?lang=en'>deceiver</a>
<br>or a wrong-doer (be) not a friend to these; punish
<br>(them) with severe punishment. 
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a>' rule was marked by vast military expeditions. After consolidating his power at home, he set off to secure the lands of Egypt, which had been conquered before by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_II?lang=en'>Cambyses II</a>, and in 519 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> he incorporated a large part of Egypt into his empire. The following year, in 518 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>, he conquered parts of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_India?lang=en'>India</a>, namely northern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Punjab_(region)?lang=en'>Punjab</a> as his inscriptions testify. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Applied_Digital_Data_Systems?lang=en'>adds</a> that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_India?lang=en'>India</a> was the 20th <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satrap?lang=en'>satrap</a> of the empire and also that parts of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indus_River?lang=en'>Indus</a> valley were also conquered.
<br>
<br>The next significant campaign was in European <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythians?lang=en'>Scythia</a> in 513 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>. Historians have proposed several theories in an attempt to clarify the objective of this campaign. They range from simple military conquest to a more propagandistic motive, revenge for a previous conflict during the reign of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Great?lang=en'>Cyrus</a> where the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythians?lang=en'>Scythians</a> had attacked <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a>. Another possible reason is that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> wanted to conquer the western <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> lands and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/European_Scythian_campaign_of_Darius_I?lang=en'>Scythian campaign</a> was supposed to threaten the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> into surrender.
<br>
<br>However, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> faced unforeseen difficulties. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythians?lang=en'>Scythians</a> evaded the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> army, using <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Feint?lang=en'>feints</a> and retreating eastwards, all the while laying waste to the countryside. The king's army chased the enemy deep into <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythians?lang=en'>Scythian</a> lands, where he sent word to their ruler, urging <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Idanthyrsus?lang=en'>Idanthyrsus</a> to fight or surrender. As <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Idanthyrsus?lang=en'>Idanthyrsus</a> refused to do either, the chase resumed. In the end, the campaign halted after a few weeks when sickness and deprivation had taken its toll on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> army. The march halted around the banks of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volga_River?lang=en'>Volga</a> river and then headed towards <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrace?lang=en'>Thrace</a>, where <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> ordered his general <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Megabyzus?lang=en'>Megabyzus</a> to subjugate the region.
<br>
<br>Besides bringing <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrace?lang=en'>Thrace</a> under <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> influence, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Megabyzus?lang=en'>Megabyzus</a> also conquered the neighbouring <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> cities. He sent envoys to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Republic_of_Macedonia?lang=en'>Macedonia</a> where <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amyntas_I_of_Macedon?lang=en'>Amyntas</a>, the king of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Republic_of_Macedonia?lang=en'>Macedonia</a>, became a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vassal?lang=en'>vassal</a> of the empire. Meanwhile, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> solidified his hold in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegean_Islands?lang=en'>Aegean Islands</a> through appointments of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> natives as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> rulers or tyrants.
<br>
<br>In 499 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tyrant?lang=en'>tyrant</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a>, convinced the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satrap?lang=en'>satrap</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaphernes?lang=en'>Artaphernes</a> to sponsor a campaign against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naxos?lang=en'>Naxos</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> gave his consent and named <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Megabates?lang=en'>Megabates</a>, Artaphemes’s cousin, as commander of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> army. They were supposed to be supported and supplied by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a>, but a quarrel between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Megabates?lang=en'>Megabates</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> resulted in the former betraying them and informing the Naxians of their plans, sabotaging the campaign. Finding himself without help, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> decided to revolt against the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a>. Seeking other allies, although he failed to acquire the support of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>, he managed to secure the aid of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eretria?lang=en'>Eretria</a>, both providing troops and ships.
<br>
<br>After six years of conflict, during which <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sardis?lang=en'>Sardis</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyprus?lang=en'>Cyprus</a>, and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dardanelles?lang=en'>Hellespont</a> were attacked, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> army defeated the rebels at the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Lade</a> in 494 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> where most of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athenian</a> fleet was destroyed. Undeterred, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> gathered his army, planning to conquer <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>. His army consisted of infantry and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>cavalry</a>, led by the general Datis. They marched from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susa?lang=en'>Susa</a> to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cilicia?lang=en'>Cilicia</a>, where ships carried them across the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegean_Sea?lang=en'>Aegean Sea</a> to the island of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samos?lang=en'>Samos</a>. Here they joined up with an armed force from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a> and sailed north, to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>.
<br>
<br>Meanwhile, the Athenians started to prepare for war. Envoys were sent to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>, but after gathering allies, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> force was still only 10,000 strong, facing 100,000 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Outnumbered_(UK_TV_series)?lang=en'>Outnumbered</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> generals needed a brilliant strategy. Two of them advised facing the enemy from within the safety of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> gates, but <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> convinced them that a direct attack would be a better choice. They agreed, on condition that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> would lead the army into the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a>.
<br>
<br>The two opposing armies met on the fields of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Marathon</a> in 490 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> army, though heavily outnumbering the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> army, was slow and overconfident. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> took advantage of this situation; as the two armies approached each other at a casual pace, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> suddenly broke into a sprint. This caught the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> off guard, and before they knew it they were forced to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> in full hand-to-hand combat. After a few hours of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> ranks broke, many of them running towards the safety of the ships or to the nearby mountains. 6,000 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> fell, while the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> army lost only 200 men. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marble?lang=en'>marble</a> blocks which the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> intended to use for the monument they were going to erect after the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a>, was instead used by the victorious <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> to build a monument for their fallen comrades. This blow was seen as an insult by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a>, who chose to fight on and prepared for another invasion. This plan, however, never came to fruition due to his death in 486 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>.
<br>
<br>The Persian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire?lang=en'>Empire</a> witnessed many improvements during <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a>' reign. He established 20 provinces or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satrap?lang=en'>satrapies</a>, with an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archon?lang=en'>archon</a> or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satrap?lang=en'>satrap</a> assigned to each. Neighbouring regions paid a fixed tribute; a fair amount was stipulated by a commission of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a>' trusted officials. 
<br>
<br>He also improved the legal system, using the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon?lang=en'>Babylonian</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hammurabi?lang=en'>Hammurabi</a> as a model and copying some of his laws completely. The laws were enforced by the judges of the empire, who needed to be incorruptible. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> removed the previous native officials, replacing them with new people loyal to him. While the punishments may seem brutal today, ranging from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Political_mutilation_in_Byzantine_culture?lang=en'>mutilation</a> to blinding, fairness was not omitted as punishment depended on the nature and severity of the crime. The new system proved to be popular, even after <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a>’s death, some laws were still in use in 218 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>.
<br>
<br>In the matters of religion, it is well known that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> was an adherent of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zoroastrianism?lang=en'>Zoroastrianism</a> or at least a firm believer of Ahura <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ahura_Mazda?lang=en'>Mazda</a>. This we can see in his inscriptions, where he attributes his success to Ahura <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ahura_Mazda?lang=en'>Mazda</a>, and in his legal system where all laws were created in the name of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zoroastrianism?lang=en'>Zoroastrian</a> god. In the lands that were under <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> control, all other religions were tolerated as long as they remained submissive and peaceful.
<br>
<br>During his reign, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> undertook impressive construction projects across the empire. In <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susa?lang=en'>Susa</a>, he built a palace complex in the northern part of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a>, which became his favourite residence. A grand project in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persepolis?lang=en'>Persepolis</a> followed; the palace complex included a military quarter, treasury, the king’s quarters and guest house. Besides the palaces, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> also finished previously incomplete construction projects of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Great?lang=en'>Cyrus</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pasargadae?lang=en'>Pasargadae</a>. In Egypt, he built many temples and restored those that had previously been destroyed.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> introduced a new universal <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Currency?lang=en'>currency</a>, the darayaka, sometime before 500 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>. This innovation made it easier to collect taxes on land, livestock, and marketplaces, which led to improved revenues for the empire.
