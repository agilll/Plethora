The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ancient Olympic Games</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Olympic_Games</b></span> were a sporting event held every four years at the sacred site of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Opel_Olympia</b></span>, in the western <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>, in honour of <span style='color: blue'><b>Zeus</b></span>, the supreme god of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek religion</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_religion</b></span>. Involving participants and spectators from all over <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and even beyond, the Games were the most important cultural event in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ancient Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and were held from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>776 BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>776_BC</b></span> to 393 CE, a run of 293 consecutive Olympiads. So important were the Games in the ancient world that they were even used as a basis for the calendar.  
<br>
<br>Sporting events were originally associated with funeral rituals, particularly those of heroes and the fallen in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medieval_warfare</b></span>, for example, the games for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Patroklos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Patroclus</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Homer</b></span>’s <span style='color: blue'><b>Iliad</b></span>. At <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Opel_Olympia</b></span>, in particular, some mythological accounts credit <span style='color: blue'><b>Zeus</b></span> with beginning the Games to celebrate his victory over <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Kronos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cronus</b></span> whilst other accounts state the hero <span style='color: blue'><b>Pelops</b></span> began them in honour of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Oinomaos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Oenomaus</b></span>. In any case, sport, a healthy body and the competitive spirit were a large part of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> education and so it is hardly surprising that organised athletic competitions would at some point be created, as they had been in the earlier <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Minoan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Minoan_civilization</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycenaean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mycenaean_Greece</b></span> civilizations.
<br>
<br>The first Olympics were held from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>776 BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>776_BC</b></span> at the first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>full moon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Full_moon</b></span> after the summer <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>solstice</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Winter_solstice</b></span> (around the middle of July) in honour of <span style='color: blue'><b>Zeus</b></span>. The winner of the first and only event, the stadion foot-race was Koroibos of <span style='color: blue'><b>Elis</b></span> and from then on every victor was recorded and each <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympiad</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Olympic_Games</b></span> named after them, thus giving us the first accurate chronology of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ancient Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> world. An <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympiad</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Olympic_Games</b></span> was not only the name of the event itself but also of the period between games. During a three-month pan-Hellenic truce, athletes and as many as 40,000 spectators came from all over <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> to participate in the Games at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Opel_Olympia</b></span>. Later, other games would be organised at other sacred sites such as <span style='color: blue'><b>Delphi</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Isthmia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Isthmian_Games</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Nemea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nemean_Games</b></span> but the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympian Games</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Olympic_Games</b></span> would remain the most prestigious.
<br>
<br>The Games started with a procession which went from the host town of <span style='color: blue'><b>Elis</b></span> to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Opel_Olympia</b></span>, led by the <span style='color: blue'><b>Hellanodikai</b></span> (judges) and on arrival at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Opel_Olympia</b></span> all athletes and officials swore an oath to follow the established rules of the competitions and to compete with honour and respect. The most important religious ceremony of the event was the sacrifice of 100 oxen, known as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hecatomb</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hecatomb</b></span>, at the altar of <span style='color: blue'><b>Zeus</b></span>, carried out when the sporting events were over.
<br>
<br>Heralds (spondophoroi) were sent from <span style='color: blue'><b>Elis</b></span> to advertise the coming of the Games across <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. Spectators came from not only the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> mainland but also the islands, <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Magna Graecia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Magna_Graecia</b></span>. To facilitate the movement of spectators and athletes and in respect of the religious importance of the Games a sacred truce (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ekecheiria</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ekecheiria</b></span>) was called across <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. Initially, the truce was for one month but in later centuries it was extended to three. No wars were permitted, no arms could be carried in the territory of <span style='color: blue'><b>Elis</b></span> and no hindrance was to be given to any spectator, athlete or theoriai - (the official missions representing particular cities) travelling to the games from wherever they came from and whichever territory they had to cross.
<br>
<br>The site of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Opel_Olympia</b></span> must have been positively buzzing during a Games with mass crowds of excited spectators staying in make-shift camp sites (only later was accommodation provided for the visitors) and admiring the masses of fine statues and buildings at the site. Food vendors, craftsmen, musicians, poets and philosophers took full advantage of the crowds to publicise their wares or ideas. Just how many spectators attended each Games is unknown but we do know that around 45,000 spectators consisting of men, slaves and foreigners sat and watched from the embankments of the stadium which hosted the main events. Spectators actively participated in the events through their boisterous support of the athletes and after each event they showered flowers and laurel leaves on the victors.
<br>
<br>Women were not permitted to participate in or watch the events although young girls were allowed in the crowd. There was a single exception to this rule, the priestess of <span style='color: blue'><b>Demeter</b></span> Chamyne. A famous breach of the men only rule was the case of Kallipateira. She had trained her son Peisirodos and when he won his race his mother, celebrating a little too exuberantly in the crowd, loosened her clothes and revealed her sex. She escaped the prescribed punishment of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>death penalty</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Capital_punishment</b></span> because she came from a family of great Olympic victors but from then on all trainers had to be naked - like the athletes - to avoid such an occurrence in the future. 
<br>
<br>Athletes trained under the watchful <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>eye</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Human_eye</b></span> of a professional trainer (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>gymnastes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gymnastes</b></span>) or physical trainer (paidotribes) who knew how to best develop particular muscles, the best diet and the correct amount of exercises to be done. Trainers were often thanked by their more successful athletes by the dedication of a statue of them at the site. Athletes also had an aleiptes who rubbed them down with oil and massaged them both before exercising and after.
<br>
<br>The athletes competed naked, probably for complete freedom of movement. Events were open to all free <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> males and the list of victors illustrates just how pan-Hellenic the Games were with athletes coming from all parts of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and in Roman times the no-foreigner rule for athletes was relaxed. Victors were those who beat all other competitors. There are practically no records of times and distances achieved by victorious athletes as these were simply not considered important, the idea was to be first amongst the best, not to beat records. 
<br>
<br>For the first 12 Olympics the stadion foot-race was the only event and it remained the most prestigious event throughout the history of the Games. The race was ran over one length (a stadion) of the stadium track, 600 ancient feet or 192 m and preliminary heats were held with heat winners going into the final. Athletes were grouped by lot and in the interest of fairness this was also the way pairings were matched in the other events. The eventual winner of the stadion would even give his name to that particular Games and so be remembered for all time.
<br>
<br>Over time other events were added to the Games to bring the total programme to 18 events spread over five days:
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>diaulos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_units_of_measurement</b></span> - the two stadium <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>lengths</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Horse</b></span> foot-race, added in 724 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anno_Domini</b></span>.
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dolichos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dolichos_(race)</b></span> - longer foot-races 7 to 20 stadium <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>lengths</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Horse</b></span>, added in 720 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anno_Domini</b></span>.
<br>wrestling - added in 708 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anno_Domini</b></span>. Competitors had to throw their opponent to the ground three times to gain victory. 
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pentathlon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pentathlon</b></span> - also added in 708 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anno_Domini</b></span>. All done in a single day, the event order was: jumping (in a soft soil pit using hand-weights or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>halteres</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Halteres</b></span> and accompanied to music), discuss (in stone, iron or bronze), stadion, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>javelin</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Javelin</b></span> (in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>wood</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Wood</b></span> and thrown using a leather thong), and wrestling. Just how an athlete won the overall event is unclear, three event victories may have guaranteed overall victory.
<br>boxing - added in 688 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anno_Domini</b></span>. Athletes wore straps of leather (himantes) around their hands, initially as protection but they evolved into destructive weapons with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>metal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Metalworking</b></span> pieces added. Rules were limited to no low-blows and no holding. Serious injuries were common and deaths not unknown.
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tethrippon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chariot_racing</b></span> - the four-horse <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>chariot race</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chariot_racing</b></span> added in 680 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anno_Domini</b></span>, run over ten or twelve circuits of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hippodrome</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hippodrome</b></span>. A version using foals over 8 circuits was added in 384 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anno_Domini</b></span>.
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>keles</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Keles</b></span> - a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>horse race</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Horse_racing</b></span> added in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>648 BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>640s_BC</b></span> and run over 6 cicuits. A version for foals was added in 256 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anno_Domini</b></span>.
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pankration</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pankration</b></span> - a mix of boxing and wrestling also added in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>648 BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>640s_BC</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pankration</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pankration</b></span> was a brutal event and the only moves not allowed were biting and gouging, although competitors did not wear the damaging leather thongs of the boxers.
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplitodromos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplitodromos</b></span> - the race in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> armour (helmet, shield and spear) between 2 and 4 stadium <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>lengths</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Horse</b></span> was added in 520 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anno_Domini</b></span> and was usually the last event of the Games.
<br>apene - a race with chariots pulled by two mules, added in 500 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anno_Domini</b></span> (dropped from 444 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anno_Domini</b></span>).
<br>kalpe - a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>trotting horse</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Harness_racing</b></span> race for mares, added in 496 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anno_Domini</b></span> (dropped from 444 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anno_Domini</b></span>).
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>synoris</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chariot_racing</b></span> - the two-horse <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>chariot race</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chariot_racing</b></span> run over eight circuits of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hippodrome</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hippodrome</b></span>, added in 408 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anno_Domini</b></span>. A version using foals over three circuits was added in 268 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anno_Domini</b></span>.
<br>competitions for trumpeters and heralds - added in 396 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anno_Domini</b></span>. This was held on the first day and the winners - those whose sound carried the furthest - were also given the honour of announcing the victors on the final day at the official prize-giving event.
<br>
<br>Athletes had to arrive at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Opel_Olympia</b></span> one month before the Games for training and, further, they had to declare that they had been in training for at least <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ten months</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ten_Months</b></span>. Non-Greeks, slaves, murderers, those convicted of defiling temples and all those who had not respected the truce were excluded from participating. Indeed, cities could be included in the latter category, for example, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> in 420 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anno_Domini</b></span>.   
<br>
<br>The events were supervised by trained judges from <span style='color: blue'><b>Elis</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue'><b>Hellanodikai</b></span> (or agonothetai) who also had various assistants such as the alytai (police officers). For the first 49 Olympics there was only one judge but he was joined by others to reach a peak of twelve, distributed amongst the various events. Originally, the office was hereditary and for life but later judges were selected from <span style='color: blue'><b>Elis</b></span> by lot. The <span style='color: blue'><b>Hellanodikai</b></span> had the power to disqualify and fine athletes for any infringement of the rules and, wearing their purple cloaks, they were given special seats of honour in the stadium. The decisions of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Hellanodikai</b></span> could never be revoked but the judges were themselves subject to judgment from a council of elders and should an athlete successfully appeal, the judge concerned could be fined.
<br>
<br>Rules were very rarely broken and when they were penalties were imposed ranging from exclusion and fines to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>flogging</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Flagellation</b></span>. Fines were paid both to the sanctuary and the wronged athlete. If an offender did not pay the fine then the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> he represented had to or else be excluded from the next Games. Revenue from fines was in part used to erect statues of <span style='color: blue'><b>Zeus</b></span> known as zanes and a number of  the bases of these statues can still be seen at the site today.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue'><b>Hellanodikai</b></span> also gave out the victory crown (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>kotinos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Olive_wreath</b></span>) of wild olive leaves and an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>olive branch</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Olive</b></span> cut from the scared tree (Kallistephanos) to each event winner. The olive was significant because the trees of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Opel_Olympia</b></span> were believed to have been originally planted by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hercules</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Heracles</b></span>. Another prize could be a red woollen ribbon which was worn on the upper arm or around the head, especially for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>chariot</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chariot_racing</b></span> racers as it was the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>horse</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Horse</b></span> owner who actually received the olive crown.
<br>
<br>Victors were welcomed back to their hometowns as heroes after the Games. Typically entering the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> in a procession where they rode a four-horse <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>chariot</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chariot_racing</b></span>, the victors had huge banquets held in their honour and they could receive additional benefits such as exemption from tax and invitations to join the political elite. Cities also received prestige from victories at the Games and for this reason they sometimes offered financial incentives for athletes such as <span style='color: blue'><b>Solon</b></span>’s 500 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>drachmas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_drachma</b></span> prize (a substantial sum considering one <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sheep</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sheep</b></span> cost one <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>drachma</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_drachma</b></span> at the time).
<br>
<br>However, the real prize for athletes was glory, fame and, in a very real sense, historical <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>immortality</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Immortality</b></span>. This was achieved through renown whilst still alive but was perpetuated after death via victor’s lists, personal statues and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>victory odes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Epinikion</b></span> written in the victor’s honour.
<br>
<br>There were many great athletes who won fame and glory in multiple Games. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Kroton</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Crotone</b></span> from southern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Italy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Italy</b></span> won three consecutive stadion races from 488 to 480 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anno_Domini</b></span>. Phanas of <span style='color: blue'><b>Pellene</b></span> managed to win three events in the Olympics of 521 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anno_Domini</b></span> - the stadion, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>diaulos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_units_of_measurement</b></span> and the race in armour. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> of Rhodes went even better and managed to win all three events in four consecutive Olympics between 164 and 152 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anno_Domini</b></span>. A feat almost matched by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hermogenes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hermogenes_of_Priene</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Xanthos</b></span>, known as ‘the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>horse</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Horse</b></span>’ who won eight running events over three Olympics between 81 and 89 CE. Milon of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Kroton</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Crotone</b></span> won the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>wrestling competition</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Wrestling</b></span> five times from 532 to 516 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anno_Domini</b></span> and the runner Astylos of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Kroton</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Crotone</b></span> won six crowns across the three Olympics of 488, 484 and 480 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anno_Domini</b></span>. Finally, Herodoros of <span style='color: blue'><b>Megara</b></span> won an incredible ten consecutive <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>trumpet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Shofar</b></span> competitions from 328 to 292 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anno_Domini</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The Games and their prestige also attracted famous competitors from outside the sporting world. The great <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athens</b></span> general and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>statesman</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Scholar-official</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Alcibiades</b></span> won three <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>chariot races</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chariot_racing</b></span> in 416 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anno_Domini</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Philip II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Philip_II_of_Macedon</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span> won the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>horse race</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Horse_racing</b></span> in 356 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anno_Domini</b></span> and repeated his winning streak in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>chariot races</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chariot_racing</b></span> of the 352 and 348 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anno_Domini</b></span> Games. Also, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Roman emperor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Nero</b></span> famously won every event he entered in 65 CE. These powerful political leaders even sought to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>milk</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Goat</b></span> the prestige of their successes at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Opel_Olympia</b></span> by minting coins to commemorate their victories.
<br>
