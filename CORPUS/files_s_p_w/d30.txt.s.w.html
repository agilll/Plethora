The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> (also often called the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>) were a series of conflicts between the Achaemenid <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states that started in 499 BC and lasted until 449 BC. The collision between the fractious political world of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and the enormous empire of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> began when <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> conquered the Greek-inhabited region of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> in 547 BC. Struggling to rule the independent-minded cities of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> appointed tyrants to rule each of them. This would prove to be the source of much trouble for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> alike.
<br>
<br>In 499 BC, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>, embarked on an expedition to conquer the island of <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>, with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> support; however, the expedition was a debacle and, preempting his dismissal, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> incited all of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> into rebellion against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. This was the beginning of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>, which would last until 493 BC, progressively drawing more regions of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> into the conflict. <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> secured military support from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>, and in 498 BC these forces helped to capture and burn the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> regional capital of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> king <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> the Great vowed to have revenge on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> for this act. The revolt continued, with the two sides effectively stalemated throughout 497â€“495 BC. In 494 BC, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> regrouped, and attacked the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>epicentre</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Epicenter</b></span> of the revolt in <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>. At the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Lade</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> suffered a decisive defeat, and the rebellion collapsed, with the final members being stamped out the following year.
<br>
<br>Seeking to secure his empire from further revolts and from the interference of the mainland <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> embarked on a scheme to conquer <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and to punish <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> for the burning of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>. The first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> began in 492 BC, with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> general <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> successfully re-subjugating <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span> before several mishaps forced an early end to the rest of the campaign. In 490 BC a second force was sent to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, this time across the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean Sea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span>, under the command of Datis and <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>. This expedition subjugated the <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyclades</b></span>, before besieging, capturing and razing <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>. However, while en route to attack <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> force was decisively defeated by the Athenians at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, ending <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> efforts for the time being.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> then began to plan to completely conquer <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, but died in 486 BC and responsibility for the conquest passed to his son <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>. In 480 BC, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> personally led the second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> with one of the largest ancient armies ever assembled. <span style='color: blue'><b>Victory</b></span> over the allied <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> states at the famous Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span> allowed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> to torch an evacuated <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and overrun most of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. However, while seeking to destroy the combined <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> suffered a severe defeat at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>. The following year, the confederated <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> went on the offensive, decisively defeating the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Plataea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Plataea</b></span>, and ending the invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> by the Achaemenid <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The allied <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> followed up their success by destroying the rest of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>, before expelling <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> garrisons from Sestos (479 BC) and <span style='color: blue'><b>Byzantium</b></span> (478 BC). Following the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> withdrawal from <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> victory at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> states of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> regained their independence. The actions of the general <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span> at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Byzantium</b></span> alienated many of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> states from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, and the anti-Persian alliance was therefore reconstituted around <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> leadership, called the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> continued to campaign against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> for the next three decades, beginning with the expulsion of the remaining <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> garrisons from <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>. At the Battle of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Eurymedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Giants_(Greek_mythology)</b></span> in 466 BC, the League won a double victory that finally secured freedom for the cities of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>. However, the League's involvement in an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemy_V_Epiphanes</b></span> (from 460â€“454 BC) resulted in a disastrous defeat, and further campaigning was suspended. A <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet was sent to <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyprus</b></span> in 451 BC, but achieved little, and when it withdrew the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> drew to a quiet end. Some historical sources suggest the end of hostilities was marked by a peace treaty between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, the Peace of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Callias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Callias_II</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Almost all the primary sources for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> are <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>; there are no surviving historical accounts from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> side. By some distance, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>main source</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Main_Source</b></span> for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> is the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, who has been called the "Father of History", was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> (then part of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> empire). He wrote his 'Enquiries' (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> Historia, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>English</span> <span style='color: green'><b>English_language</b></span> (The) <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span>) around 440â€“430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, which would still have been recent history. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s approach was novel and, at least in Western society, he invented 'history' as a discipline. As historian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tom Holland</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tom_Holland_(actor)</b></span> has it, "For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>manifest destiny</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Manifest_destiny</b></span>, but rather explanations he could verify personally.
<br>
<br>Some later ancient historians, starting with <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>, criticised <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> and his methods. Nevertheless, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> chose to begin his history where <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> left off (at the Siege of Sestos) and felt <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting.Plutarch criticised <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> in his essay "On The Malignity of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>", describing <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> as "Philobarbaros" (barbarian-lover) for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed. A negative view of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> was passed on to <span style='color: blue'><b>Renaissance</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Europe</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Europe</b></span>, though he remained well read. However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaeological finds that have repeatedly confirmed his version of events. The prevailing modern view is that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> did a remarkable job in his Historia, but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>skepticism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Skepticism</b></span>. Nevertheless, there are still some historians who believe <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> made up much of his story.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>military history</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Military_history</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> between the end of the second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_the_Peloponnesian_War</b></span> (479â€“431 BC) is not well supported by surviving ancient sources. This period, sometimes referred to as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pentekontaetia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pentecontaetia</b></span> (the Fifty Years) by ancient writers, was a period of relative peace and prosperity within <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. The richest source for the period, and also the most contemporaneous, is <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>' History of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_the_Peloponnesian_War</b></span>, which is generally considered by modern historians to be a reliable primary account. <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> only mentions this period in a digression on the growth of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> power in the run up to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_the_Peloponnesian_War</b></span>, and the account is brief, probably selective and lacks any dates.Nevertheless, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s account can be, and is, used by historians to draw up a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>skeleton</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Skeleton</b></span> chronology for the period, on to which details from archaeological records and other writers can be superimposed.
<br>
<br>More detail for the whole period is provided by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Plutarch</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Parallel_Lives</b></span>, in his biographies of <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, Aristides and especially <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Plutarch</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Parallel_Lives</b></span> was writing some 600 years after the events in question, and is therefore a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>secondary source</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Secondary_source</b></span>, but he often names his sources, which allows some degree of verification of his statements. In his biographies, he draws directly from many ancient histories that have not survived, and thus often preserves details of the period that are omitted in <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s accounts. The final major existing source for the period is the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>universal history</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Universal_history</b></span> (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bibliotheca historica</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bibliotheca_historica</b></span>) of the 1st century BC <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sicilian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sicily</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Diodorus Siculus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Diodorus_Siculus</b></span>. Much of Diodorus's writing about this period is drawn from the much earlier <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephorus</b></span>, who also wrote a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>universal history</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Universal_history</b></span>. Diodorus is also a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>secondary source</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Secondary_source</b></span> and often derided by modern historians for his style and inaccuracies, but he preserves many details of the ancient period found nowhere else.
<br>
<br>Further scattered details can be found in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Orestis</b></span>'s Description of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, while the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Byzantine</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Byzantium</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Suda</b></span> dictionary of the 10th century AD preserves some anecdotes found nowhere else. Minor sources for the period include the works of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pompeius Trogus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gnaeus_Pompeius_Trogus</b></span> (epitomized by Justinus), <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cornelius Nepos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cornelius_Nepos</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Ctesias</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cnidus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Knidos</b></span> (epitomized by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Photius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Photios_I_of_Constantinople</b></span>), which are not in their original textual form. These works are not considered reliable (especially <span style='color: blue'><b>Ctesias</b></span>), and are not particularly useful for reconstructing the history of this period.

<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>classical</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_antiquity</b></span> period believed that, in the dark age that followed the collapse of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycenaean civilization</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mycenaean_Greece</b></span>, significant numbers of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fled and had emigrated to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> and settled there. Modern historians generally accept this migration as historic (but separate from the later colonization of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mediterranean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mediterranean_Sea</b></span> by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>). There are, however, those who believe the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionians</b></span> migration cannot be explained as simply as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>classical</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_antiquity</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> claimed. These settlers were from three tribal groups: the <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeolians</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Dorians</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> had settled about the coasts of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Caria</b></span>, founding the twelve cities that made up <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>. These cities were <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Myus</b></span> and Priene in <span style='color: blue'><b>Caria</b></span>; <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephesus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Colophon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Colophon_(city)</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lebedos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lebedus</b></span>, Teos, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Clazomenae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Klazomenai</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Phocaea</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Erythrae</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span>; and the islands of <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span> and Chios.Although the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionians</b></span> cities were independent of one another, they recognized their shared heritage and supposedly had a common <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_temple</b></span> and meeting place, the Panionion. They thus formed a 'cultural league', to which they would admit no other cities, or even other tribal <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The cities of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> remained independent until they were conquered by the <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydians</b></span> of western <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydians</b></span> king <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alyattes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alyattes_of_Lydia</b></span> attacked <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, a conflict that ended with a treaty of alliance between <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span>, that meant that <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> would have internal autonomy but follow <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span> in foreign affairs. At this time, the <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydians</b></span> were also in conflict with the Median <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span>, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> sent an army to aid the <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydians</b></span> in this conflict. Eventually a peaceable settlement was established between the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydians</b></span>, with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Halys River</span> <span style='color: green'><b>KÄ±zÄ±lÄ±rmak_River</b></span> set up as the border between the kingdoms. The famous <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydians</b></span> king <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span> succeeded his father <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alyattes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alyattes_of_Lydia</b></span> in around 560 BC and set about conquering the other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> states of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> prince <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> led a rebellion against the last <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> king <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> in 553 BC. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> was a grandson of <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> and was supported by part of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> aristocracy. By 550 BC, the rebellion was over, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> had emerged victorious, founding the Achaemenid <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span> in place of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> kingdom in the process.Croesus saw the disruption in the Median <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> as an opportunity to extend his realm and asked the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oracle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pythia</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Delphi</b></span> whether he should attack them. The <span style='color: blue'><b>Oracle</b></span> supposedly replied the famously ambiguous answer that "if <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span> was to cross the Halys he would destroy a great empire".Blind to the ambiguity of this prophecy, <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span> attacked the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, but was eventually defeated and <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span> fell to Cyrus.By crossing the Halys, <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span> had indeed destroyed a great empire â€“ his own.
<br>
<br>While fighting the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> had sent messages to the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> asking them to revolt against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> rule, which the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> had refused to do.After <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> finished the conquest of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionians</b></span> cities now offered to be his subjects under the same terms as they had been subjects of Croesus.Cyrus refused, citing the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span>' unwillingness to help him previously. The <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> thus prepared to defend themselves, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> sent the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> general <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> to conquer them. He first attacked <span style='color: blue'><b>Phocaea</b></span>; the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phocaeans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocaea</b></span> decided to abandon their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> entirely and sail into exile in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicily</b></span>, rather than become <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> subjects (although many later returned).Some Teians also chose to emigrate when <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> attacked Teos, but the rest of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> remained, and were each in turn conquered.
<br>
<br>In the years following their conquest, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> found the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> difficult to rule. Elsewhere in the empire, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> identified elite native groups such as the priesthood of <span style='color: blue'><b>Judea</b></span> â€“ to help him rule his new subjects.No such group existed in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities at this time; while there was usually an aristocracy, this was inevitably divided into feuding factions.The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> thus settled for sponsoring a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> in each <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionians</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>, even though this drew them into the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span>' internal conflicts. Furthermore, certain tyrants might develop an independent streak and have to be replaced.The tyrants themselves faced a difficult task; they had to deflect the worst of their fellow citizens' hatred, while staying in the favour of the Persians.In the past, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> states had often been ruled by tyrants, but that form of government was on the decline. Past tyrants had also tended and needed to be strong and able leaders, whereas the rulers appointed by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were simply place-men. Backed by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> military might, these tyrants did not need the support of the population, and could thus rule absolutely. On the eve of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, it is probable that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionians</b></span> population had become discontented and was ready for rebellion.
<br>
<br>In the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> both sides made use of spear-armed infantry and light <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>missile</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Missile</b></span> troops. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> armies placed the emphasis on heavier infantry, while <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> armies favoured lighter troop types.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> military consisted of a diverse group of men drawn across the various nations of the empire. However, according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, there was at least a general conformity in armour and style of fighting. The troops were usually armed with a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>bow</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bow_and_arrow</b></span>, a 'short spear' and a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sword</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gladius</b></span> or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>axe</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_axe</b></span>, carried a wicker shield. They wore a leather jerkin,although individuals of high stature wore high quality metal armor. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> most likely used their bows to wear down the enemy, then closed in to deliver the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>final blow</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Final_Blow</b></span> with spears and swords.The first rank of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> infantry formations, the so-called '<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sparabara</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sparabara</b></span>', had no bows, carried larger wicker shields and were sometimes armed with longer spears. Their role was to protect the back ranks of the formation. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> probably fought as lightly armed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>missile</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Missile</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The style of warfare between the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states, which dates back until at least 650 BC (as dated by the '<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chigi vase</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chigi_vase</b></span>'), was based around the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> supported by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>missile</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Missile</b></span> troops.The '<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>' were foot soldiers usually drawn from the members of the middle-classes (in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> called the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>zeugites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zeugites</b></span>), who could afford the equipment necessary to fight in this manner.The heavy armour usually included a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>breastplate</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Breastplate</b></span> or a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>linothorax</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Linothorax</b></span>, greaves, a helmet, and a large round, concave shield (the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>aspis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aspis</b></span> or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aspis</b></span>).<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> were armed with long spears (the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dory</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dory</b></span>), which were significantly longer than <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> spears, and a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sword</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gladius</b></span> (the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>xiphos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xiphos</b></span>).The heavy armour and longer spears made them superior in hand-to-hand combatand gave them significant protection against ranged attacks.Lightly armed skirmishers, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>psiloi</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Psiloi</b></span> also comprised a part of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> armies growing in importance during the conflict; at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Plataea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Plataea</b></span>, for instance, they may have formed over half the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army. Use of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> armies is not reported in the battles of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>.
<br>
<br>At the beginning of the conflict, all naval forces in the eastern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mediterranean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mediterranean_Sea</b></span> had switched to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>trireme</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Trireme</b></span>, a warship powered by three banks of oars. The most common <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>naval tactics</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naval_tactics</b></span> during the period were ramming (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> triremes were equipped with a cast-bronze ram at the bows), or boarding by ship-borne marines. More experienced naval powers had by this time also begun to use a manoeuver known as diekplous. It is not clear what this was, but it probably involved sailing into gaps between enemy ships and then ramming them in the side.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> naval forces were primarily provided by the seafaring people of the empire: <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenicians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span>, Cilicians and Cypriots. Other coastal regions of the Persian <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span> would contribute ships throughout the course of the wars.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> and associated revolts in <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeolis</b></span>, Doris, <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyprus</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Caria</b></span> were military rebellions by several regions of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule, lasting from 499 to 493 BC. At the heart of the rebellion was the dissatisfaction of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> with the tyrants appointed by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> to rule them, along with opposition to the individual actions of two <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> tyrants, <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> and Aristagoras.In 499 BC the then <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>, launched a joint expedition with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> to conquer <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>, in an attempt to bolster his position in <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> (both financially and in terms of prestige).The mission was a debacle,and sensing his imminent removal as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> chose to incite the whole of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> into rebellion against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> king <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> the Great.
<br>
<br>Struggling to rule the independent-minded cities of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> appointed local tyrants to rule each of them. This would prove to be the source of much trouble for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> alike. In 498 BC, supported by troops from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> marched on, captured, and burnt <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>. However, on their return journey to <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>, they were followed by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> troops, and decisively beaten at the Battle of Ephesus.This campaign was the only offensive action taken by the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span>, who subsequently went on the defensive. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> responded in 497 BC with a three-pronged attack aimed at recapturing the outlying areas of the rebellious territory,but the spread of the revolt to <span style='color: blue'><b>Caria</b></span> meant the largest army, under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>, moved there instead. While at first campaigning successfully in <span style='color: blue'><b>Caria</b></span>, this army was wiped out in an ambush at the Battle of Pedasus.This resulted in a stalemate for the rest of 496 and 495 BC.
<br>
<br>By 494 BC the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army and navy had regrouped, and they made straight for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>epicentre</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Epicenter</b></span> of the rebellion at <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> fleet sought to defend <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> by sea, but was defeated decisively at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Lade</b></span>, after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Samians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Samos</b></span> had defected.Miletus was then besieged, captured, and its population was enslaved. This double defeat effectively ended the revolt, and the <span style='color: blue'><b>Carians</b></span> surrendered to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> as a result.The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> spent 493 BC reducing the cities along the west coast that still held out against them,before finally imposing a peace settlement on <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> that was considered to be both just and fair.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> constituted the first major conflict between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and the Achaemenid <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span> and represents the first phase of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> had been brought back into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fold, but <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> had vowed to punish <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> for their support for the revolt. Moreover, seeing that the political situation in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> posed a continued threat to the stability of his <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span>, he decided to embark on the conquest of all <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.
<br>
<br>After having reconquered <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> began to plan their next moves of extinguishing the threat to their empire from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>; and punishing <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>. The resultant first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> consisted of two main campaigns.
<br>
<br>The first campaign, in 492 BC, was led by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>'s son-in-law <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>, who re-subjugated <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span>, which had nominally been part of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> empire since 513 BC. <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> was also able to force <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span> to become a fully subordinate <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>client kingdom</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Client_state</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>; it had previously been a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vassal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vassal_state</b></span>, but retained a broad degree of autonomy.However, further progress in this campaign was prevented when <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>'s fleet was wrecked in a storm off the coast of Mount <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mount_Athos</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> himself was then injured in a raid on his camp by a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thracian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thrace</b></span> tribe, and after this he returned with the rest of the expedition to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The following year, having given clear warning of his plans, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> sent ambassadors to all the cities of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, demanding their submission.He received it from almost all of them, except <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, both of whom instead executed the ambassadors.With <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> still defiant, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> now also effectively at war with him, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> ordered a further military campaign for the following year.
<br>
<br>In 490 BC, Datis and <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> (son of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>) were given command of an amphibious invasion force, and set sail from Cilicia.The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> force sailed first to the island of Rhodes, where a Lindian Temple Chronicle records that Datis besieged the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lindos</b></span>, but was unsuccessful.The fleet sailed next to <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>, to punish the Naxians for their resistance to the failed expedition the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> had mounted there a decade earlier. Many of the inhabitants fled to the mountains; those that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> caught were enslaved. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> then burnt the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> and temples of the Naxians. The fleet then proceeded to island-hop across the rest of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> on its way to <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>, taking hostages and troops from each island.
<br>
<br>The task force sailed on to <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span>, and to the first major target, Eretria.The Eretrians made no attempt to stop the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> from landing or advancing and thus allowed themselves to be besieged.For six days, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> attacked the walls, with losses on both sides;however, on the seventh day two reputable Eretrians opened the gates and betrayed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> was razed, and temples and shrines were looted and burned. Furthermore, according to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>'s commands, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> enslaved all the remaining townspeople.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet next headed south down the coast of <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>, landing at the bay of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, roughly 40 kilometres (25 mi) from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>. Under the guidance of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span>, the general with the greatest experience of fighting the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> army marched to block the two exits from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Plain</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>. Stalemate ensued for five days, before the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> decided to continue onward to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, and began to load their troops back onto the ships. After the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> had loaded their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> (their strongest soldiers) on the ships, the 10,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> soldiers descended from the hills around the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Plain</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> crushed the weaker <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> foot soldiers by routing the wings before turning towards the centre of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> line. The remnants of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army fled to their ships and left the battle.Herodotus records that 6,400 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> bodies were counted on the battlefield; the Athenians lost only 192 men.
<br>
<br>As soon as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> survivors had put to sea, the Athenians marched as quickly as possible to Athens.They arrived in time to prevent <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> from securing a landing in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>. Seeing his opportunity lost, <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> ended the year's campaign and returned to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> was a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>watershed</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Drainage_basin</b></span> in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, showing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> could be beaten. It also highlighted the superiority of the more heavily armoured <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>, and showed their potential when used wisely.
<br>
<br>After the failure of the first invasion, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> began raising a huge new army with which he intended to subjugate <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> completely. However, in 486 BC, his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> subjects revolted, and the revolt forced an indefinite postponement of any <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> expedition. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> died while preparing to march on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span>, and the throne of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> passed to his son <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> crushed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemy_V_Epiphanes</b></span>, and very quickly resumed the preparations for the invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. Since this was to be a full-scale invasion, it needed longterm planning, stockpiling and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>conscription</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Conscription</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> decided that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> would be bridged to allow his army to cross to <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>, and that a canal should be dug across the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>isthmus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Isthmus_of_Corinth</b></span> of Mount <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mount_Athos</b></span> (a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC while rounding this coastline). These were both feats of exceptional ambition that would have been beyond the capabilities of any other contemporary state. However, the campaign was delayed by one year because of another revolt in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylonia</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> had the sympathy of several <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states, including <span style='color: blue'><b>Argos</b></span>, which had pledged to defect when the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> reached their borders.The <span style='color: blue'><b>Aleuadae</b></span> family, who ruled <span style='color: blue'><b>Larissa</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Thessaly</b></span>, saw the invasion as an opportunity to extend their power.Thebes, though not explicitly 'Medising', was suspected of being willing to aid the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> once the invasion force arrived.
<br>
<br>In 481 BC, after roughly four years of preparation, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> began to muster the troops to invade <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> gives the names of 46 nations from which troops were drafted.The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army was gathered in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> in the summer and autumn of 481 BC. The armies from the Eastern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrapies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> were gathered in Kritala, <span style='color: blue'><b>Cappadocia</b></span> and were led by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> where they passed the winter.Early in spring, it moved to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Abydos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Abydos</b></span> where it was joined with the armies of the western satrapies.Then the army that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> had mustered marched towards <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>, crossing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> on two pontoon bridges.

<br>The numbers of troops that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> mustered for the second invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> have been the subject of endless dispute. Most modern scholars reject as unrealistic the figures of 2.5 million given by <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> and other ancient sources because the victors likely miscalculated or exaggerated. The topic has been hotly debated, but the consensus revolves around the figure of 200,000.
<br>
<br>The size of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet is also disputed, although perhaps less so. Other ancient authors agree with <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' number of 1,207. These numbers are by ancient standards consistent, and this could be interpreted that a number around 1,200 is correct. Among modern scholars, some have accepted this number, although suggesting the number must have been lower by the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>. Other recent works on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> reject this number, viewing 1,207 as more of a reference to the combined <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet in the <span style='color: blue'><b>Iliad</b></span>. These works generally claim that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span>.
<br>
<br>A year after <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span>, the hero of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, was injured in a military campaign to <span style='color: blue'><b>Paros</b></span>. Taking advantage of his incapacitation, the powerful <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alcmaeonid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alcmaeonidae</b></span> family arranged for him to be prosecuted for the failure of the campaign. A huge fine was imposed on <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> for the crime of 'deceiving the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> people', but he died weeks later from his wound.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The politician</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Politician</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, with a power base firmly established amongst the poor, filled the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vacuum</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Power_vacuum</b></span> left by <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span>'s death, and in the following decade became the most influential politician in Athens.During this period, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> continued to support the expansion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>' naval power.The Athenians were aware throughout this period that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> interest in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> had not ended,and <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s naval policies may be seen in the light of the potential threat from Persia.Aristides, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s great rival, and champion of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>zeugites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zeugites</b></span> (the 'upper hoplite-class') vigorously opposed such a policy.
<br>
<br>In 483 BC, a vast new seam of silver was found in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> mines at Laurium.Themistocles proposed that the silver should be used to build a new fleet of triremes, ostensibly to assist in a long running war with Aegina.Plutarch suggests that <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> deliberately avoided mentioning <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, believing that it was too distant a threat for the Athenians to act on, but that countering <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> was the fleet's aim.Fine suggests that many Athenians must have admitted that such a fleet would be needed to resist the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, whose preparations for the coming campaign were known. <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s motion was passed easily, despite strong opposition from Aristides. Its passage was probably due to the desire of many of the poorer Athenians for paid employment as rowers in the fleet. It is unclear from the ancient sources whether 100 or 200 ships were initially authorised; both Fine and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Holland</span> <span style='color: green'><b>County_of_Holland</b></span> suggest that at first 100 ships were authorised and that a second vote increased this number to the levels seen during the second invasion.Aristides continued to oppose <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s policy, and tension between the two camps built over the winter, so the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ostracism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ostracism</b></span> of 482 BC became a direct contest between <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> and Aristides.In what <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Holland</span> <span style='color: green'><b>County_of_Holland</b></span> characterises as, in essence, the world's first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>referendum</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Referendum</b></span>, Aristides was ostracised, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s policies were endorsed.Indeed, becoming aware of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> preparations for the coming invasion, the Athenians voted to build more ships than those for which <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> had asked.Thus, during the preparations for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> had become the leading politician in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The Spartan king <span style='color: blue'><b>Demaratus</b></span> had been stripped of his kingship in 491 BC, and replaced with his cousin <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leotychides</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leotychidas</b></span>. Sometime after 490 BC, the humiliated <span style='color: blue'><b>Demaratus</b></span> had chosen to go into exile, and had made his way to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>'s court in <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Demaratus</b></span> would from then on act as an advisor to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>, and later <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>, on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> affairs, and accompanied <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> during the second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion. At the end of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s book 7, there is an anecdote relating that prior to the second invasion, <span style='color: blue'><b>Demaratus</b></span> sent an apparently blank <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>wax tablet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Wax_tablet</b></span> to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>. When the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>wax</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Wax</b></span> was removed, a message was found scratched on the wooden backing, warning the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>'s plans. However, many historians believe that this chapter was inserted into the text by a later author, possibly to fill a gap between the end of book 7 and the start of book 8. The veracity of this anecdote is therefore unclear.
<br>
<br>In 481 BC, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> sent ambassadors to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> states throughout <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, asking for food, land, and water as tokens of their submission to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. However, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>' ambassadors deliberately avoided <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, hoping thereby that those states would not learn of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>' plans.States that were opposed to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> thus began to coalesce around these two <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> states. A congress of states met at <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>late autumn</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Late_Autumn_(1960_film)</b></span> of 481 BC, and a confederate alliance of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states was formed. This confederation had powers both to send envoys to ask for assistance and to dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points after joint consultation. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> does not formulate an abstract name for the union but simply calls them (the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>) and "the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> who had sworn alliance" (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Godley</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_Godley</b></span> translation) or "the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> who had banded themselves together" (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Rawlinson</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Richard_Rawlinson</b></span> translation). From now on, they will be referred to as the '<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span>'. <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> had a leading role in the congress but the interests of all the states influenced defensive strategy.Little is known about the internal workings of the congress or the discussions during its meetings. Only 70 of the nearly 700 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states sent representatives. Nevertheless, this was remarkable for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>disjointed</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Disjointed</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> world, especially since many of the city-states present were still technically at war with one another.
<br>
<br>Having crossed into <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span> in April 480 BC, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army began its march to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, taking 3 months to travel unopposed from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> to Therme. It paused at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Doriskos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Doriscus</b></span> where it was joined by the fleet. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> reorganized the troops into tactical units replacing the national formations used earlier for the march.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> 'congress' met again in the spring of 480 BC and agreed to defend the narrow Vale of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tempe</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vale_of_Tempe</b></span> on the borders of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thessaly</b></span> and block <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>'s advance.However, once there, they were warned by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> I of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span> that the vale could be bypassed and that the army of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> was overwhelmingly large, thus the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> retreated. Shortly afterwards, they received the news that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> had crossed the Hellespont.At this point, a second strategy was suggested by <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> to the allies. The route to southern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> (<span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>) would require the army of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> to travel through the narrow pass of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>. This could easily be blocked by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>, despite the overwhelming numbers of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. Furthermore, to prevent the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> bypassing <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> by sea, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and allied navies could block the straits of <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span>. This dual strategy was adopted by the congress.However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> should it come to it, while the women and children of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> were evacuated to the Peloponnesian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Troezen</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>'s estimated time of arrival at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> coincided with both the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympic Games</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Olympic_Games</b></span> and the festival of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Carneia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Carnea</b></span>. For the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, warfare during these periods was considered sacrilegious.Despite the uncomfortable timing, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> considered the threat so grave that they dispatched their king <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> with his personal bodyguard (the <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippeis</b></span>) of 300 men. The customary elite young men in the <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippeis</b></span> were replaced by veterans who already had children. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> was supported by contingents from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> Peloponnesian cities, and other forces that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> picked up on the way to Thermopylae.The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> proceeded to occupy the pass, rebuilt the wall the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phocians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis</b></span> had built at the narrowest point of the pass, and waited for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>'s arrival.
<br>
<br>When the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> arrived at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> in mid-August, they initially waited for three days for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> to disperse. When <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> was eventually persuaded that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> intended to contest the pass, he sent his troops to attack.However, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> position was ideally suited to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> warfare, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> contingents being forced to attack the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> head on.The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> withstood two full days of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> attacks, including those by the elite <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian Immortals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Immortals_(Achaemenid_Empire)</b></span>. However, towards the end of the second day, they were betrayed by a local resident named <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ephialtes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephialtes_of_Trachis</b></span> who revealed to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mountain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mountain_gun</b></span> path that led behind the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> lines. Made aware by scouts that they were being outflanked, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> dismissed most of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> army, remaining to guard the rear with perhaps 2,000 men. On the final day of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, the remaining <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> sallied forth from the wall to meet the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> in the wider part of the pass to slaughter as many <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> as they could, but eventually they were all killed or captured.
<br>
<br>Simultaneous with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> naval force of 271 triremes defended the Straits of <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span> against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, thus protecting the flank of the forces at Thermopylae.Here the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet held off the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> for three days; however, on the third evening the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> received news of the fate of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> troops at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>. Since the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet was badly damaged, and since it no longer needed to defend the flank of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> retreated from <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span> to the island of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Victory</span> <span style='color: green'><b>HMS_Victory</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> meant that all <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span> fell to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>; <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span> was then open to invasion. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The remaining</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Remaining</b></span> population of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> was evacuated, with the aid of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet, to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>. The Peloponnesian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> began to prepare a defensive line across the Isthmus of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinth</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Corinth</b></span>, building a wall, and demolishing the road from <span style='color: blue'><b>Megara</b></span>, abandoning <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> to the Persians.Athens thus fell to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>; the small number of Athenians who had barricaded themselves on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Acropolis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Acropolis_of_Athens</b></span> were eventually defeated, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> then ordered <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> to be razed.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> had now captured most of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, but <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> had perhaps not expected such <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>defiance</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Defiance_(TV_series)</b></span>; his priority was now to complete the war as quickly as possible.If <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> could destroy the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> navy, he would be in a strong position to force an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> surrender;conversely by avoiding destruction, or as <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> hoped, by destroying the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> could prevent conquest from being completed.The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet thus remained off the coast of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span> into September, despite the imminent arrival of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. Even after <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> fell, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet remained off the coast of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>, trying to lure the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>. Partly because of deception by <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, the navies met in the cramped Straits of Salamis.There, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> numbers became a hindrance, as ships struggled to maneuver and became disorganised. Seizing the opportunity, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet attacked, and scored a decisive victory, sinking or capturing at least 200 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> ships, therefore ensuring the safety of the Peloponnessus.
<br>
<br>According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, after the loss of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> attempted to build a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>causeway</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Causeway</b></span> across the channel to attack the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> evacuees on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>, but this project was soon abandoned. With the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>' naval superiority removed, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> feared that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> might sail to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> and destroy the pontoon bridges. His general <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> volunteered to remain in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and complete the conquest with a hand-picked group of troops, while <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> retreated to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> with the bulk of the army.Mardonius over-wintered in <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Thessaly</b></span>; the Athenians were thus able to return to their burnt-out <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> for the winter.
<br>
<br>Over the winter, there was some tension among the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span>. In particular, the Athenians, who were not protected by the Isthmus, but whose fleet was the key to the security of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>, felt that they had been treated unfairly, and so they refused to join the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> navy in the spring.Mardonius remained in <span style='color: blue'><b>Thessaly</b></span>, knowing an attack on the Isthmus was pointless, while the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> refused to send an army outside the Peloponessus.Mardonius moved to break the stalemate, by offering peace to the Athenians, using <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> I of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span> as an intermediate. The Athenians made sure that a Spartan delegation was on hand to hear the Athenians reject the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>' offer. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> was thus evacuated again, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> marched south and re-took possession of it. <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> now repeated his offer of peace to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> refugees on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, with <span style='color: blue'><b>Megara</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>, sent emissaries to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> demanding assistance, and threatening to accept the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> terms if they were not aided.In response, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> summoned a large army from the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span> cities and marched to meet the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.

<br>When <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> heard the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> army was on the march, he retreated into <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span>, near <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>, trying to draw the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> into open terrain where he could use his cavalry.The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> army, under the command of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>regent</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Regent</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span>, stayed on high ground above <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> to protect themselves against such tactics.After several days of maneuver and stalemate, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span> ordered a night-time retreat towards the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span>' original positions.This maneuver went awry, leaving the Athenians, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> and Tegeans isolated on separate hills, with the other contingents scattered further away near Plataea.Seeing that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> might never have a better opportunity to attack, <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> ordered his whole army forward.However, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> infantry proved no match for the heavily armoured <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>,and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> broke through to <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>'s bodyguard and killed him.After this the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> force dissolved in rout; 40,000 troops managed to escape via the road to <span style='color: blue'><b>Thessaly</b></span>,but the rest fled to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> camp where they were trapped and slaughtered by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, finalising the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> victory.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> recounts that, on the afternoon of the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Plataea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Plataea</b></span>, a rumour of their victory at that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> reached the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span>' navy, at that time off the coast of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mount Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mycale</b></span> in Ionia.Their morale boosted, the Allied marines fought and won a decisive victory at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span> that same day, destroying the remnants of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet, crippling <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>'s <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sea power</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naval_warfare</b></span>, and marking the ascendancy of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet.Whilst many modern historians doubt that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span> took place on the same day as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Plataea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Plataea</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> may well only have occurred once the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> received news of the events unfolding in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span> was, in many ways, the beginning of a new phase in the conflict, in which the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> would go on the offensive against the Persians.The immediate result of the victory at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span> was a second revolt amongst the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Samians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Samos</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> had actively fought against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>, thus openly declaring their rebellion, and the other cities followed in their example.
<br>
<br>Shortly after <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>, the Allied fleet sailed to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> to break down the pontoon bridges, but found that this had already been done.The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians remained to attack the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chersonesos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gallipoli</b></span>, still held by the Persians.The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> and their allies made for Sestos, the strongest town in the region. Amongst them was one Oeobazus of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cardia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Stomach</b></span>, who had with him the cables and other equipment from the pontoon bridges.The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> governor, <span style='color: blue'><b>Artayctes</b></span> had not prepared for a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span>, not believing that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> would attack.The Athenians therefore were able to lay a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span> around Sestos.The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span> dragged on for several months, causing some discontent amongst the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> troops,but eventually, when the food ran out in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fled at night from the least guarded area of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>. The Athenians were thus able to take possession of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> the next day.
<br>
<br>Most of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> troops were sent straight away to pursue the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. The party of Oeobazus was captured by a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thracian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thrace</b></span> tribe, and Oeobazus was sacrificed to the god Plistorus.The Athenians eventually caught <span style='color: blue'><b>Artayctes</b></span>, killing some of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> with him but taking most of them, including <span style='color: blue'><b>Artayctes</b></span>, captive.Artayctes was <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>crucified</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Crucifixion</b></span> at the request of the people of <span style='color: blue'><b>Elaeus</b></span>, a town which <span style='color: blue'><b>Artayctes</b></span> had plundered while governor of the Chersonesos.The Athenians, having pacified the region, then sailed back to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, taking the cables from the pontoon bridges with them as trophies.
<br>
<br>In 478 BC, still operating under the terms of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> alliance, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> sent out a fleet composed of 20 Peloponnesian and 30 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> ships supported by an unspecified number of allies, under the overall command of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span>. According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>, this fleet sailed to <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyprus</b></span> and "subdued most of the island".Exactly what <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> means by this is unclear. Sealey suggests that this was essentially a raid to gather as much treasure as possible from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> garrisons on Cyprus.There is no indication that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> attempted to take possession of the island, and, shortly after, they sailed to Byzantium.Certainly, the fact that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> repeatedly campaigned in <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyprus</b></span> suggests either that the island was not garrisoned by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> in 478 BC, or that the garrisons were quickly expelled.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet then sailed to <span style='color: blue'><b>Byzantium</b></span>, which they besieged and eventually captured. Control of both Sestos and <span style='color: blue'><b>Byzantium</b></span> gave the allies command of the straits between <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> (over which the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> had crossed), and allowed them access to the merchant trade of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Black</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Black_Sea</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The aftermath of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span> was to prove troublesome for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span>. Exactly what happened is unclear; <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> gives few details, although later writers added plenty of lurid insinuations. Through his arrogance and arbitrary actions (<span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> says "violence"), <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span> managed to alienate many of the Allied contingents, particularly those that had just been freed from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> overlordship. The <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> and others asked the Athenians to take leadership of the campaign, to which they agreed The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, hearing of his behaviour, recalled <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span> and tried him on charges of collaborating with the enemy. Although he was acquitted, his reputation was tarnished and he was not restored to his command.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span> returned to <span style='color: blue'><b>Byzantium</b></span> as a private citizen in 477 BC, and took command of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> until he was expelled by the Athenians. He then crossed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bosporus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bosphorus</b></span> and settled in <span style='color: blue'><b>Kolonai</b></span> in the <span style='color: blue'><b>Troad</b></span>, until he was again accused of collaborating with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> and was recalled by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> for a trial after which he starved himself to death. The timescale is unclear, but <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span> may have remained in possession of <span style='color: blue'><b>Byzantium</b></span> until 470 BC.
<br>
<br>In the meantime, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> had sent Dorkis to <span style='color: blue'><b>Byzantium</b></span> with a small force, to take command of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> force. However, he found that the rest of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> were no longer prepared to accept Spartan leadership, and therefore returned home.
<br>
<br>Athens and her "empire" in 431 BC. The empire was the direct descendant of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>
<br>After <span style='color: blue'><b>Byzantium</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> were allegedly eager to end their involvement in the war. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> were supposedly of the view that, with the liberation of mainland <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>, the war's purpose had already been reached. There was also perhaps a feeling that securing long-term security for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Asia</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> would prove impossible.In the aftermath of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>, the Spartan king <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leotychides</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leotychidas</b></span> had proposed transplanting all the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> to <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span> as the only method of permanently freeing them from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> dominion. <span style='color: blue'><b>Xanthippus</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> commander at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>, had furiously rejected this; the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> cities were originally <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> colonies, and the Athenians, if no-one else, would protect the Ionians.This marks the point at which the leadership of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> Alliance effectively passed to the Athenians. With the Spartan withdrawal after <span style='color: blue'><b>Byzantium</b></span>, the leadership of the Athenians became explicit.
<br>
<br>The loose alliance of city-states that had fought against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>'s invasion had been dominated by <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian league</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_League</b></span>. With the withdrawal of these states, a congress was called on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>holy island</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lindisfarne</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Delos</b></span> to institute a new alliance to continue the fight against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. This alliance, now including many of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean islands</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Islands</b></span>, was formally constituted as the 'First <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> Alliance', commonly known as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>. According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>, the official aim of the League was to "avenge the wrongs they suffered by ravaging the territory of the king".In reality, this goal was divided into three main effortsâ€”to prepare for future invasion, to seek revenge against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, and to organize a means of dividing spoils of war. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The members</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Members</b></span> were given a choice of either supplying armed forces or paying a tax to the joint treasury; most states chose the tax.
<br>
<br>Throughout the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>470s BC</span> <span style='color: green'><b>470s_BC</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> campaigned in <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Islands</b></span> to remove the remaining <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> garrisons from the region, primarily under the command of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> politician <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span>. In the early part of the next decade, <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span> began campaigning in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>, seeking to strengthen the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> position there. At the Battle of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Eurymedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Giants_(Greek_mythology)</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Pamphylia</b></span>, the Athenians and allied fleet achieved a stunning double victory, destroying a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet and then landing the ships' marines to attack and rout the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army. After this <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> took an essentially passive role in the conflict, anxious not to risk <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> if possible.
<br>
<br>Towards the end of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>460s BC</span> <span style='color: green'><b>460s_BC</b></span>, the Athenians took the ambitious decision to support a revolt in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrapy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> empire. Although the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> task force achieved initial successes, they were unable to capture the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> garrison in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Memphis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>University_of_Memphis</b></span>, despite a 3-year long siege.The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> then counterattacked, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> force was itself besieged for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>18 months</span> <span style='color: green'><b>18_Months</b></span>, before being wiped out.This disaster, coupled with ongoing warfare in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, dissuaded the Athenians from resuming conflict with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. In 451 BC however, a truce was agreed in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span> was then able to lead an expedition to <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyprus</b></span>. However, while besieging <span style='color: blue'><b>Kition</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span> died, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> force decided to withdraw, winning another double victory at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis-in-Cyprus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis,_Cyprus</b></span> in order to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>extricate</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Extricate</b></span> themselves. This campaign marked the end of hostilities between the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, and therefore the end of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>.
<br>
<br>After the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis-in-Cyprus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis,_Cyprus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> makes no further mention of conflict with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, saying that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> simply returned home. Diodorus, on the other hand, claims that in the aftermath of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Wars_of_the_Delian_League</b></span>, a full-blown peace treaty (the "Peace of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Callias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Callias_II</b></span>") was agreed with the Persians.Diodorus was probably following the history of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephorus</b></span> at this point, who in turn was presumably influenced by his teacher Isocratesâ€”from whom there is the earliest reference to the supposed peace, in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>380 BC</span> <span style='color: green'><b>380_BC</b></span>. Even during the 4th century BC, the idea of the treaty was controversial, and two authors from that period, <span style='color: blue'><b>Callisthenes</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Theopompus</b></span>, appear to reject its existence.
<br>
<br>It is possible that the Athenians had attempted to negotiate with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> previously. <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> suggests that in the aftermath of the victory at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Eurymedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Giants_(Greek_mythology)</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia</b></span> had agreed a peace treaty with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, even naming <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Callias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Callias_II</b></span> as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> ambassador involved. However, as <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> admits, <span style='color: blue'><b>Callisthenes</b></span> denied that such a peace was made at this point (c. 466 BC).<span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> also mentions, in passing, an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> embassy headed by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Callias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Callias_II</b></span>, which was sent to <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span> to negotiate with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia</b></span>. This embassy included some <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Argive</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Argos</b></span> representatives and can probably be therefore dated to c. 461 BC (after an alliance was agreed between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Argos</b></span>).This embassy may have been an attempt to reach some kind of peace agreement, and it has even been suggested that the failure of these hypothetical negotiations led to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> decision to support the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemy_V_Epiphanes</b></span>. The ancient sources therefore disagree as to whether there was an official peace or not, and, if there was, when it was agreed.
<br>
<br>Opinion amongst modern historians is also split; for instance, Fine accepts the concept of the Peace of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Callias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Callias_II</b></span>, whereas Sealey effectively rejects it.Holland accepts that some kind of accommodation was made between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, but no actual treaty.Fine argues that <span style='color: blue'><b>Callisthenes</b></span>'s denial that a treaty was made after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Eurymedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Giants_(Greek_mythology)</b></span> does not preclude a peace being made at another point. Further, he suggests that <span style='color: blue'><b>Theopompus</b></span> was actually referring to a treaty that had allegedly been negotiated with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> in 423 BC.If these views are correct, it would remove one major obstacle to the acceptance of the treaty's existence. A further argument for the existence of the treaty is the sudden withdrawal of the Athenians from <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyprus</b></span> in 449 BC, which Fine suggests makes most sense in the light of some kind of peace agreement. On the other hand, if there was indeed some kind of accommodation, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s failure to mention it is odd. In his digression on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pentekontaetia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pentecontaetia</b></span>, his aim is to explain the growth of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> power, and such a treaty, and the fact that the Delian allies were not released from their obligations after it, would have marked a major step in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> ascendancy.Conversely, it has been suggested that certain passages elsewhere in <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s history are best interpreted as referring to a peace agreement.There is thus no clear consensus amongst modern historians as to the treaty's existence.
<br>
<br>The ancient sources that give details of the treaty are reasonably consistent in their description of the terms:
<br>
<br>All <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> were to 'live by their own laws' or 'be autonomous' (depending on translation)
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> satraps (and presumably their armies) were not to travel west of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Halys River</span> <span style='color: green'><b>KÄ±zÄ±lÄ±rmak_River</b></span> (<span style='color: blue'><b>Isocrates</b></span>) or closer than a day's journey on horseback to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean Sea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> (<span style='color: blue'><b>Callisthenes</b></span>) or closer than three days' journey on foot to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean Sea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> (<span style='color: blue'><b>Ephorus</b></span> and Diodorus).
<br>No <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> warship was to sail west of <span style='color: blue'><b>Phaselis</b></span> (on the southern coast of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>), nor west of the Cyanaean rocks (probably at the eastern end of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bosporus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bosphorus</b></span>, on the north coast).
<br>If the terms were observed by the king and his generals, then the Athenians were not to send troops to lands ruled by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.
<br>From the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> perspective, such terms would not be so humiliating as they might at first seem. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> already allowed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> to be governed under their own laws (under the reorganization conducted by <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>, following the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>). By these terms, the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> were still <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> subjects, as they had been. Furthermore, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> had already demonstrated their superiority at sea at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Eurymedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Giants_(Greek_mythology)</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis-in-Cyprus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis,_Cyprus</b></span>, so any legal limitations for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet were nothing more than "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>de jure</span> <span style='color: green'><b>De_jure</b></span>" recognition of military realities. In exchange for limiting the movement of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> troops in one region of the realm, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia</b></span> secured a promise from the Athenians to stay out of his entire realm.
<br>
<br>Towards the end of the conflict with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, the process by which the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> became the Athenian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> reached its conclusion.The allies of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> were not released from their obligations to provide either money or ships, despite the cessation of hostilities.In <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>First Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>First_Peloponnesian_War</b></span> between the power-blocs of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, which had continued on/off since 460 BC, finally ended in 445 BC, with the agreement of a thirty-year truce.However, the growing enmity between <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> would lead, just 14 years later, into the outbreak of the Second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span>. This disastrous conflict, which dragged on for 27 years, would eventually result in the utter destruction of Athenian power, the dismemberment of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>, and the establishment of a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartan hegemony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_hegemony</b></span> over Greece.However, not just <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> sufferedâ€”the conflict would significantly weaken the whole of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Repeatedly defeated in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, and plagued by internal rebellions that hindered their ability to fight the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, after 449 BC, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia</b></span> and his successors instead adopted a policy of divide-and-rule. Avoiding fighting the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> themselves, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> instead attempted to set <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> against <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, regularly bribing politicians to achieve their aims. In this way, they ensured that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> remained distracted by internal conflicts, and were unable to turn their attentions to Persia.There was no open conflict between the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> until 396 BC, when the Spartan king <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Agesilaus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Agesilaus_II</b></span> briefly invaded <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>; as <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> points out, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> were far too busy overseeing the destruction of their own power to fight against the "barbarians".
<br>
<br>If the wars of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> shifted the balance of power between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> in favour of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, then the subsequent half-century of internecine conflict in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> did much to restore the balance of power to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> entered the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> in 411 BC forming a mutual-defence pact with <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> and combining their naval resources against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> in exchange for sole <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> control of Ionia.In 404 BC when <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Younger</b></span> attempted to seize the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian throne</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persian_Empire</b></span>, he recruited 13,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mercenaries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mercenary</b></span> from all over the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> world, of which <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> sent 700â€“800, believing they were following the terms of the defence pact and unaware of the army's true purpose.After the failure of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Younger</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> tried to regain control of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> city-states, which had rebelled during the conflict. The <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> refused to capitulate and called upon <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> for assistance, which she provided, in 396â€“395 BC.Athens, however, sided with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, which led in turn to another large-scale conflict in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corinthian_War</b></span>. Towards the end of that conflict, in 387 BC, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> sought the aid of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> to shore up her position. Under the so-called "King's Peace" that brought the war to an end, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia</b></span> demanded and received the return of the cities of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, in return for which the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> threatened to make war on any <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> state that did not make peace. This humiliating treaty, which undid all the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> gains of the previous century, sacrificed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> so that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> could maintain their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hegemony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Theban_hegemony</b></span> over Greece.It is in the aftermath of this treaty that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> orators began to refer to the Peace of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Callias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Callias_II</b></span> (whether fictional or not), as a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>counterpoint</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Counterpoint</b></span> to the shame of the King's Peace, and a glorious example of the "good old days" when the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> had been freed from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>
