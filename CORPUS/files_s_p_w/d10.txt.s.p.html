<br>In the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> in 480 BC, an alliance of South <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> city-states fought the invading <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> army in the pass of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a>. Vastly outnumbered, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> delayed the enemy in one of the most famous last stands of history. A small force led by King <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> blocked the only road through which the massive army of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> could pass. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Persians?lang=en'>The Persians</a> succeeded in defeating the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> but sustained heavy losses, disproportionate to those of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>. A local resident named <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephialtes_of_Trachis?lang=en'>Ephialtes</a> betrayed the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>, revealing a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mountain_gun?lang=en'>mountain</a> path that led behind the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> lines. Dismissing the rest of the army, King <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> stayed behind with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Thermopylae?lang=en'>300 Spartans</a> and 700 Thespian volunteers. Though they knew it meant their own deaths, they secured the retreat of the other <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> forces.
<br>
<br>The losses of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> army alarmed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>. When his navy was later defeated at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Salamis</a> he fled <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> leaving only part of his force to finish the conquest of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>. It was defeated at the Battle of Plataea.The performance of the defenders at the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> is often used as an example of the advantages of training, equipment and good use of terrain to maximize an army's potential, as well as a symbol of courage against overwhelming odds. The heroic sacrifice of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thespiae?lang=en'>Thespians</a> has captured the minds of many throughout the ages and has given birth to many cultural references as a result.
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> says:The force with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> was sent forward by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> in advance of their main body, that the sight of them might encourage the allies to fight, and hinder them from going over to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a>, as was likely they might have done had they seen that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> was backward.
<br>
<br>They intended presently, when they had celebrated the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carnea?lang=en'>Carneian Festival</a>, which was what now kept them at home, to leave a garrison in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>, and hasten in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Full_Force?lang=en'>full force</a> to join the army. The rest of the allies intended to act similarly; for it happened that the Olympic Festival fell exactly at this same period. None of them looked to see the contest at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> decided so speedily; wherefore they were content to send forward a mere advance guard. Such accordingly were the intentions of the allies.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> the Spartan king was put in charge of the army at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a>. Of his over lordship <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> says only that they especially looked up to him. He was convinced that he was going to certain death, which he would not have been if he had thought the forces given him were adequate for a victory. He selected only men who had fathered sons that were old enough to take over the family responsibilities.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> mentions in his Sayings of Spartan Women that after encouraging her husband before his departure for the battlefield, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gorgon?lang=en'>Gorgo</a>, the wife of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a>, asked him what she should do when he had left. To this he replied: Marry a good man, and have many good children. Another common saying of Spartan Women was: Come home with your shield or on it. The meaning being that the soldier was to return home either victorious (with your shield) or dead - i.e. carried away from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> field (on their shield), rather than fleeing the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> and dropping their shield in cowardice (as it was too heavy a piece of armor to carry while running).
<br>Topography of the battlefield. At the time, the pass of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> consisted of a track along the shore of the Gulf of Malis so narrow that only one <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chariot?lang=en'>chariot</a> could pass through. On the southern side of the track stood the cliffs, while on the north side was the gulf. Along the path was a series of three constrictions, or "gates" (pylai), and at the center gate a short wall that had been erected by the Phobias in the previous century to aid in their defense against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thessaly?lang=en'>Thessalian</a> invasions.
<br>
<br>The name "hot gates" comes from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hot_spring?lang=en'>hot springs</a> that were located there. Today the pass is not that, but is inland, due to infilling of the Gulf of Malis. The old track appears at the foot of hills around the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plain?lang=en'>plain</a>, flanked by a modern road. It still is a natural defensive position to modern armies.
<br>
<br>When the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> were being roughly handled, they were retreating, and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a>, whom the king was calling immortals, having shown themselves forth, were advancing, of whom the first was <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hydarnes?lang=en'>Hydarnes</a>. It was thought that they would accomplish victory. But when they were battling the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>, they were bearing no more success than the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a>, but the same results. For fighting in a small passage, they could not make use of their number, and using smaller spears, could not engage the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> with success.
<br>
<br>And turning their backs, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> would flee convincingly, and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> would advance with a shout and a din. The triumphing ones would turn to be the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>, and the ones having turned themselves were holding off the greater number of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a>. A few of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> were falling due to the superiority of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> force, but the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> were not able to take hold of the pass. It is said that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>, looking on, jumped from his seat three times in fear for his army.
<br>
<br>â€‹On the following day, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> were contending no more successfully. With some of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> surviving, (the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a>) hoping that they (The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>), having been covered in wounds, would not be able to raise their hands (to fight), attacked again; but having been arranged by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clan?lang=en'>clan</a> and company, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> were surviving, and each one was fighting in share, except for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phocis?lang=en'>Phocians</a>, who were guarding the other pass.
<br>Late on the second day of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a>, as the king was pondering what to do next, he received a windfall circumstance: a Malian, named <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephialtes_of_Trachis?lang=en'>Ephialtes</a>, informed him of a path around <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> and offered to guide them. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephialtes_of_Trachis?lang=en'>Ephialtes</a> was motivated by the desire of a reward, though he was later assassinated. The path led from east of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> camp along the ridge of Mt. Anopaea behind the cliffs that flanked the pass. It branched, one path leading to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phocis?lang=en'>Phocis</a>, and the other down to the Gulf of Malis at Alpenus, first town of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Locris?lang=en'>Locris</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> had stationed 1000 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phocis?lang=en'>Phocian</a> volunteers on the heights to guard this path..
<br>
<br>For all their previous indignation and insistence on a defense at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a>, they were not prepared: there were no advance positions, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Factions_of_Halo?lang=en'>sentinels</a> or patrols. Their first warning of the approach of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immortality?lang=en'>Immortals</a> under <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hydarnes?lang=en'>Hydarnes</a> was the rustling of oak leaves at first light on the third day of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> says that they "jumped up", suggesting that they were still asleep, and were "greatly <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amazed?lang=en'>amazed</a>", which no alert unit should have been. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hydarnes?lang=en'>Hydarnes</a> was as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amazed?lang=en'>amazed</a> to see them hastily arming themselves. He feared that they were <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a>, but was enlightened by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephialtes_of_Trachis?lang=en'>Ephialtes</a>. Not wishing to be delayed by an assault, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hydarnes?lang=en'>Hydarnes</a> resorted to a tactic that later turned out to be the winning one: he fired "showers of arrows" at them. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phocis?lang=en'>Phocians</a> retreated to the crest of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mountain_gun?lang=en'>mountain</a>, there to make a last stand (their story). <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Persians?lang=en'>The Persians</a> branched left to Alpenus. For this act, the name of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephialtes_of_Trachis?lang=en'>Ephialtes</a> received a lasting stigma: it means "nightmare" and is synonymous with "traitor" in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a>
<br>
<br>After several days of fighting, Magistias, a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oracle?lang=en'>seer</a>", inspected the entrails of an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Animal_sacrifice?lang=en'>animal sacrifice</a>. It was custom of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> to slice an animals underside and inspect its internal organs. By the shape and color of the organs of the sacrifice, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> would determine whether the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> would end favorably for them (or not). On this day, however, Magistias inspected the sacrifice, and he told the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> that death was destined to them at dawn. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>, however, were unfazed by this <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_grim?lang=en'>grim</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Omen?lang=en'>omen</a>.
<br>
<br>They were less concerned about living or dying, than they were with how many <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> they killed (apparently, this bad <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Omen?lang=en'>omen</a> was referring to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephialtes_of_Trachis?lang=en'>Ephialtes</a> and his betrayal of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>). He was leading a large group of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> through a "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cattle?lang=en'>cow</a> path" which was really unknown to many. This path would lead the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> behind the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Laconia?lang=en'>Lacedemonians</a>, ergo allowing the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> to fight on both sides of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Laconia?lang=en'>Lacedemonians</a>. Many of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> were arguing not to stay and fight the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> because it was suicidal, so <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> himself dismissed them. However the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thespiae?lang=en'>Thespians</a>, and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thebes,_Greece?lang=en'>Thebans</a> alone were staying to fight. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thebes,_Greece?lang=en'>Thebans</a> were not wanting to fight but <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> was holding them hostage by their word. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thespiae?lang=en'>Thespians</a> however, declared that they would not leave <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> behind and that they would fight to the death beside him and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a>. Demophilius, son of Diadromes, was the general of them. This section has been translated from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, and then explained by Mr. Gregory J <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gustav_Knittel?lang=en'>Knittel</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doctor_of_Philosophy?lang=en'>Ph.D.</a>
<br>
<br>Final stand of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thespiae?lang=en'>Thespians</a>: None of the actions of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> were a surprise to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a>. From a variety of sources he was kept apprised of their every move, receiving first <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Espionage?lang=en'>intelligence</a> of the outflanking movement before first light. When he learned that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phocis?lang=en'>Phocians</a> had not held, he called a council. It was just at dawn.Some of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> wished to depart, and some to stay. At the end of the council some departed.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> believed that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> blessed their departure with an order, but he related the other point of view, that they departed without orders. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> had pledged themselves to fight to the death, and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thebes,_Greece?lang=en'>Thebans</a> were held as hostage against their will. However, a contingent of about 700 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thespiae?lang=en'>Thespians</a>, led by general <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Demophilus_of_Thespiae?lang=en'>Demophilus</a>, the son of Diadromes, refused to leave with the other <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>, but cast in their lot with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a>. Ostensibly the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> were obeying their oath and following the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delphi?lang=en'>oracle</a> from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delphi?lang=en'>Delphi</a>.
<br>
<br>However, it would have been good generalship to delay the advance of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> and cover the retreat of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> army; in fact, with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> so close at hand, it probably was a tactical requirement, made more palatable by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delphi?lang=en'>oracle</a>. At dawn <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> made libations, waited until he thought the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immortality?lang=en'>Immortals</a> had time to descend the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mountain_gun?lang=en'>mountain</a>, and then began to advance. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> this time sallied out from the wall to meet them in the wider part of the pass with a view toward slaughtering as many as they could. This they succeeded in doing. They fought with spears until the spears were all shattered and then switched to xiphoi (short swords). In this struggle <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> tells us that two brothers of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> fell, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abrocomes?lang=en'>Abrocomes</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hyperanthes?lang=en'>Hyperanthes</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> also died in the assault. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> fought for his body, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> winning. Receiving <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Espionage?lang=en'>intelligence</a> that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephialtes_of_Trachis?lang=en'>Ephialtes</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immortality?lang=en'>Immortals</a> were coming up, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> withdrew and took a stand on a small hill " <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kolonos?lang=en'>Kolonos</a>" behind the wall. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thebes,_Greece?lang=en'>Thebans</a> under Leontiades put hands up, but a few were slain before the surrender was accepted.  Some of the remaining <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> were fighting with their hands and teeth. Tearing down part of the wall, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> ordered the hill surrounded and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> rained down arrows until the last <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> was dead. Archaeology has confirmed the arrow shower at the end.
<br>
<br>Aftermath  When the body of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> was recovered by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a>, in a rage at the loss of so many of his soldiers, ordered that the head be cut off, and the body <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crucifixion?lang=en'>crucified</a>. This was very uncommon for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a>: they had the habit of treating enemies that fought bravely against them with great honor, as the example of Asonides captured earlier off <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Skyros?lang=en'>Skyros</a> shows. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> was known for his rages, as when he had the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dardanelles?lang=en'>Hellespont</a> whipped because it would not obey him. After the departure and defeat of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> collected their dead and buried them on the hill. A stone lion was erected to commemorate <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a>. Forty years after the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a>' body was returned from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>, where he was buried again with full honors and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Funeral_games?lang=en'>funeral games</a> were held every year.The simultaneous naval Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Artemisium?lang=en'>Artemisium</a> was a draw, whereupon the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athenian</a> navy retreated. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Persians?lang=en'>The Persians</a> had control of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegean_Sea?lang=en'>Aegean Sea</a> and all of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> as far south as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attica?lang=en'>Attica</a>; the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> prepared to defend the Isthmus of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnese?lang=en'>Peloponnese</a>, while <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes I</a> sacked <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>, whose inhabitants had already fled to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Salamis</a>
