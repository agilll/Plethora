<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> , d. 497/496 BC, was the leader of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a> in the late 6th century BC and early 5th century BC and a key player during the early years of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionian_Revolt?lang=en'>Ionian Revolt</a> against the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> Achaemenid <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire?lang=en'>Empire</a>.
<br>
<br>By the time extant history hears of him, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> is already serving as deputy governor of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a>, a polis on the western coast of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a> around 500 BC. He was the son of Molpagoras, previous <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tyrant?lang=en'>tyrant</a> of an independent <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a>, and brother-in-law[1] (and nephew[2]) of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a>, whom the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> had set up as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tyrant?lang=en'>tyrant</a>, but never quite trusted. After general <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Megabazus?lang=en'>Megabazus</a> presented his complaints about <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a> to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persia</a>, the latter summoned <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a> to his court and detained him at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susa?lang=en'>Susa</a>, the main reason being that he wanted a trustworthy advisor.[1] On the recommendation of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenids</a> then appointed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> as the new ruler of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a>.[1] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> ruled <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a> while <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a> remained in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susa?lang=en'>Susa</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Assignment_(1997_film)?lang=en'>The assignment</a> was put forward as temporary. Privately, everyone knew that he was being kept under observation away from his troops.[3]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> was the main <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestration?lang=en'>orchestrator</a> of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionian_Revolt?lang=en'>Ionian Revolt</a> on secret instruction by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a>, when the latter learned of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> plans to interfere directly in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> took advantage of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> dissatisfaction with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> rule to incite an alliance of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polis?lang=en'>poleis</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a>. Soliciting assistance from the states of mainland <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> he failed to obtain the help of a major state, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>. He did obtain the half-hearted assistance of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>. Their attack on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satrap?lang=en'>satrapy</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lydia?lang=en'>Lydia</a> having been defeated, they withdrew, abandoning <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> to his fate.
<br>
<br>In the last months of the failing revolt, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> were reconquering rebel country <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a>. Choosing not to remain and make a stand alone, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> led a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colonies_in_antiquity?lang=en'>colony</a> to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrace?lang=en'>Thrace</a>, where he had negotiated a franchise to settle from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrace?lang=en'>Thracians</a>. No sooner did he arrive than he and all his men were massacred in a surprise attack by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrace?lang=en'>Thracians</a>, for reasons unspecified by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, whether loyal to the Great King, or influenced by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythians?lang=en'>Scythians</a>, who hated the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionians?lang=en'>Ionians</a> for their rescue of the Great King, or just because they changed their minds about the number of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Hellenes</a> they would allow in their country. The revolt gained <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Momentum?lang=en'>momentum</a> briefly but then began to fail again. When all was nearly lost, the Great King allowed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a> to convince him that he could settle the conflict and now should be sent back to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> was gone. According to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, they never met again.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a> never succeeded in reaching <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a>. Reporting first to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sardis?lang=en'>Sardis</a>, undoubtedly still recovering from fire, whether with or without the Great King's complicity (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> does not say), he was interrogated concerning his true <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Loyalties_(1933_film)?lang=en'>loyalties</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a> swore complete ignorance of the events of the revolt and unquestionable loyalty to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a>. He admitted nothing, but the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satrap?lang=en'>satrap</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaphernes?lang=en'>Artaphernes</a>, was not in the least deceived. He said, "I will tell thee how the case stands, Histaeus: this <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shoe?lang=en'>shoe</a> is of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thy_(district)?lang=en'>thy</a> stitching; <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> has but put it on.[4]
<br>
<br>Seeing that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jig?lang=en'>jig</a> was up, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a> escaped that night and took ship at the coast, probably at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephesus?lang=en'>Ephesus</a>. He had no trouble raising troops and finding ships, but he found that he was not trusted by the revolutionaries. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a> would not have him back. He became a soldier of fortune in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegean_Sea?lang=en'>Aegean</a> until he was hunted down and executed by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaphernes?lang=en'>Artaphernes</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionian_Revolt?lang=en'>Ionian revolt</a> was finally settled in 494/493 BC. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Persians?lang=en'>The Persians</a> went on to plot the conquest of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> under the pretext of a punitive campaign against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>.
<br>
<br>Certain exiled citizens of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naxos?lang=en'>Naxos</a> came to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a> to seek refuge. They asked <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> to supply them with troops, so that they could regain control of their homeland. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> considered that if he was able to supply troops to the Naxians, then he could become ruler of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naxos?lang=en'>Naxos</a>. So he agreed to assist the Naxians.[3] He explained that he did not have enough troops of his own, but that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaphernes?lang=en'>Artaphernes</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a>’ brother and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satrap?lang=en'>satrap</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lydia?lang=en'>Lydia</a>, who commanded a large army and navy on the coast of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Asia</a>, could help supply troops. The Naxians agreed to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> seeking <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaphernes?lang=en'>Artaphernes</a>' support and supplied him with money.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> travelled to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sardis?lang=en'>Sardis</a> and suggested that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaphernes?lang=en'>Artaphernes</a> attack <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naxos?lang=en'>Naxos</a> and restore the exiles. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Persians?lang=en'>The Persians</a> would then gain control of the island. He explained to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaphernes?lang=en'>Artaphernes</a> that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naxos?lang=en'>Naxos</a> “was a fine and fertile island, close to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionians?lang=en'>Ionian</a> coast, and rich both in treasures and slaves.”[5] It was also the gateway to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyclades?lang=en'>Cyclades</a>, which the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> did not yet rule. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> promised that he would both fund the expedition and give <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaphernes?lang=en'>Artaphernes</a> a bonus sum. He also tempted <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaphernes?lang=en'>Artaphernes</a> by adding that capturing the island would place other <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polis?lang=en'>poleis</a> of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyclades?lang=en'>Cyclades</a> under his control. They would serve as bases for an invasion of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Euboea?lang=en'>Euboea</a>.[5] After securing the permission of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susa?lang=en'>Susa</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaphernes?lang=en'>Artaphernes</a> agreed and promised 200 ships.
<br>
<br>The following spring, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> and the Naxian exiles sailed with the fleet. Unfortunately for the success of the invasion, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> quarrelled with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Admiral?lang=en'>admiral</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Megabates?lang=en'>Megabates</a>. He interfered in the discipline of the latter over the ship captains to save a friend from harsh punishment for an infraction (failure to set a watch on his ship). <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> saved his friend but lost the friendship and loyalty of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Admiral?lang=en'>admiral</a>, who expected to be in overall command. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Schism?lang=en'>schism</a> was irreparable, being the very first incident of the subsequent <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionian_Revolt?lang=en'>Ionian revolt</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Megabates?lang=en'>Megabates</a> sabotaged the entire operation by secretly informing the Naxians that they were about to be attacked, taking away the element of surprise. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naxos?lang=en'>Naxos</a> then had enough time to prepare for a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Siege?lang=en'>siege</a>. Four months later, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Siege?lang=en'>siege</a> still held, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> were out of supplies and had only limited funds remaining. The expedition was then considered a failure and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> sailed home.[6]
<br>
<br>Due to his failure to make good on his Naxian promises, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a>’ political position was at risk. He began to plan a revolt with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Milesians</a> and the other <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionians?lang=en'>Ionians</a>. Meanwhile, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a>, still detained at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susa?lang=en'>Susa</a>, had tattooed a message upon the shaved head of a slave. Once his hair had grown back, he sent him to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Message_(Grandmaster_Flash_and_the_Furious_Five_song)?lang=en'>The message</a> told <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> to revolt. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a>, desperate to resume his authority at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a>, hoped <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> would send him to deal with a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Milesian</a> revolt.
<br>
<br>Both leaders being of the same mind, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> conferred with a council of his supporters, who agreed to a rebellion in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a> in 499 BC. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> was supported by most of the citizens in council, except the historian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hecataeus_of_Miletus?lang=en'>Hecataeus</a>.[7] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hecataeus_of_Miletus?lang=en'>Hecataeus</a> voted against the revolt because he believed that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionians?lang=en'>Ionians</a> would be out-matched. Defeat would be inevitable. Once the vote was taken, however, there is no evidence that he recused himself from the revolt. In fact, he had suggestions to make. Once the war began, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionians?lang=en'>Ionians</a> did not allow any fence-sitting among themselves, although they could not stop the larger allies from withdrawing. In general knowledge, warring nations do not allow citizens of any social status to comment from the sidelines without participating in the war effort.
<br>
<br>As soon as the vote for war was certain, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> took steps to secure <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> military assets. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naxos?lang=en'>Naxos</a> fleet was recovering from its ordeal at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Myus?lang=en'>Myus</a>. Now in a position of command – <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> is not specific – <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> sent a party under Iatragoras to arrest the admirals still with the fleet, some several men. Ironically, these were mainly <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a>. They were later released and sent home. Now that the rebellion was in the open, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> “set himself to damage <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> in every way he could think of.”[8]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norfolk_Scope?lang=en'>The scope</a> of the revolt spread rapidly to all <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> foresaw that one <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> would soon be crushed. He therefore set about to create an alliance of all the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionian</a> cities, but the members also came from regions beyond <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a>. He made a number of constitutional changes, not all of which are clear. First he relinquished his own tyranny. Approaching the other states, he convinced them to end theirs.[8] Finally he ordered all of the states to create a board of generals[9] to report, apparently, to him. When his government was in place he sailed to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Lacedaemon</a> and other states of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> in search of allies.
<br>
<br>There has been some question as to the exact meaning of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>' governmental terms, and as to the form of government of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionian</a> alliance. The most fundamental question is where <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> got his authority over the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionians?lang=en'>Ionians</a> in the first place. They were all under the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satrap?lang=en'>satrapy</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lydia?lang=en'>Lydia</a>, not under <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satrap?lang=en'>satrap</a> was <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tyrant?lang=en'>tyrant</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a> was appointed by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satrap?lang=en'>satrap</a>, but he also appointed all the other tyrants. For reasons not specified in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a> had the upper hand.[10]
<br>
<br>One can only assume a leadership role of some kind of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> over the other tyrants, whether personal or according to some unspecified convention. In order to gain the participation of the people in the revolt, we are told, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> "let go" the tyranny and established <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isonomia?lang=en'>isonomia</a>, which the translators translate variously with imprecise terms, such as "equality of government." According to Liddell and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walter_Scott?lang=en'>Scott</a>, a standard dictionary of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>ancient Greek</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> uses it to mean the "equality of rights" in a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athenian_democracy?lang=en'>democracy</a>.
<br>
<br>Apparently <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> established <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athenian_democracy?lang=en'>democracy</a>, but then he went on to "put a stop to tyranny" in all the other <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionian</a> cities, and moreover to insist that they select boards of generals reporting to him, which are not democratic powers. No voting is mentioned. Apparently a new sovereign state had been formed with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> as its chief. He had not stepped down, but up. The state had the power to levy taxes and troops. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> was commander of the joint armed forces. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a> was to be the new capital. In fact the new sovereign <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a> issued its own coinage between 499 and its destruction by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> in 494.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> appealed to the Spartan king, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cleomenes_I?lang=en'>Cleomenes I</a>, to help them throw off the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> yoke. He praised the quality of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan warriors</a>, and argued that a pre-emptive invasion of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persia</a> would be easy. To illustrate his view, he had brought along a "bronze tablet on which a map of all the earth was engraved, and all the sea, and all the rivers."[11] No more information is given about the map, but the circumstantial evidence suggests it was most likely the world map of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hecataeus_of_Miletus?lang=en'>Hecataeus</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a>, an important player in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Milesian</a> political life of the times.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> claimed that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> would be easy to defeat, as they fought in “trousers and turbans,” clearly not a sign of good warriors.[12] He also tempted him with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> riches. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cleomenes_I?lang=en'>Cleomenes I</a> asked <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> to wait two days for an answer. When they next met, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cleomenes_I?lang=en'>Cleomenes I</a> asked how long it would take to reach <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susa?lang=en'>Susa</a>, and upon learning that it was a three months’ journey, he firmly refused Spartan assistance as his troops would be gone for too long. At the time, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> was concerned over possible attacks from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Argos?lang=en'>Argives</a>.[13] The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> historian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> claimed that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> attempted to change <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cleomenes_I?lang=en'>Cleomenes I</a>’ mind with bribes, until the king's young daughter <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gorgon?lang=en'>Gorgo</a> warned that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> would corrupt him.[14] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> left without the requested assistance.

<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> next went to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>, where he made a convincing speech, promising “everything that came into his head, until at last he succeeded.”[15] Won over, the Athenians agreed to send ships to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> went before them. The Athenians subsequently arrived in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a> with twenty triremes and five others that belonged to the Eretrians. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> described the arrival of these ships as the beginning of troubles between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> and barbarians.[16] Once all his allies had arrived, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> put his brother Charopinus and another <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Milesian</a>, Hermophantus, in charge of the expedition, and the whole contingent set out for the provincial capital, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sardis?lang=en'>Sardis</a>, while <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> remained to govern at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a>.
<br>
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acropolis_of_Athens?lang=en'>acropolis</a> at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sardis?lang=en'>Sardis</a>, now forested and eroded, with a few pinnacles of ruins. About half the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Massif?lang=en'>massif</a> is shown at an angle of elevation so close under the cliffs as to accentuate the perception of height.
<br>The first leg of the journey was to proceed along the coast to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephesus?lang=en'>Ephesus</a>. Using it as base, they went overland to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sardis?lang=en'>Sardis</a>, on which they descended by surprise. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satrap?lang=en'>satrap</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaphernes?lang=en'>Artaphernes</a> and his forces retreated to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acropolis_of_Athens?lang=en'>acropolis</a> immediately. A fire, started by accident in the town, accidentally burned down the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greek_temple?lang=en'>temple</a> of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lydians?lang=en'>Lydian</a> goddess Cybebe (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cybele?lang=en'>Cybele</a>). Attributing the fire to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionians?lang=en'>Ionian</a> maliciousness, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> later used it as an excuse for burning <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> temples.
<br>
<br>The fire forced the defenders of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acropolis_of_Athens?lang=en'>acropolis</a> to abandon it in favor of the marketplace. Its defence coincided fortuitously with the arrival of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> reinforcements. Interpreting the tumult as a counter-attack, The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionians?lang=en'>Ionians</a> retreated to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tmolus?lang=en'>Tmolus</a>, a nearby elevation, from which they escaped by night.[17] The reinforcements followed the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionians?lang=en'>Ionians</a>, caught up with them near <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephesus?lang=en'>Ephesus</a> and soundly defeated them.[18]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Persians?lang=en'>The Persians</a> had obtained <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lydia?lang=en'>Lydia</a>, including all the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> cities, by defeating the last Anatolian-speaking kingdom of the same name. They made such a show of mercy as to win the hearts and minds of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Anatolians?lang=en'>Anatolians</a>, as well as of some of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>. In that sense, the "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionian_Revolt?lang=en'>Ionian Revolt</a>" was <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/De_facto?lang=en'>de facto</a> an Anatolian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Civil_war?lang=en'>civil war</a>. A call for assistance went rapidly around the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satrap?lang=en'>satrapy</a>. Joint Persian-Anatolian forces hastened overnight to the assistance of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satrap?lang=en'>satrap</a>.
<br>
<br>They arrived with such short notice and major fanfare as to frighten away the Ionian-Athenian forces. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Cambridge_Ancient_History?lang=en'>The Cambridge Ancient History</a> article attributes this swift arrival to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>cavalry</a>, which also had no trouble tracking and catching the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionians?lang=en'>Ionians</a> before the gates of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephesus?lang=en'>Ephesus</a>. The losses of the East <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> were so great that they slunk away, so to speak, leaving <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> and the rebels to fend for themselves. An air of doom pervaded the revolt, but they fought with such spirit that the rebellion spilled over into the islands
<br>
<br>After this <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a>, the Athenians refused to continue to fight in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionian_Revolt?lang=en'>Ionian Revolt</a> and returned to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>. Because of their participation in this <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a>, however, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> king, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a>, swore vengeance on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> and commanded a servant to repeat to him three times every day at dinner, “Master, remember the Athenians.”[19] The story is somewhat and probably hypocritically naive (but not necessarily on that account false), as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> intended expansion into the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Balkans?lang=en'>Balkans</a> all along. They still held parts of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrace?lang=en'>Thrace</a> from their previous abortive expedition into <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythia?lang=en'>Scythia</a>, only stopped when they learned the true size of the country (most of Russia) and the danger of their position in it.
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionians?lang=en'>Ionians</a> fought on, gaining control of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Byzantium?lang=en'>Byzantium</a> and the surrounding towns as well as the greater part of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caria?lang=en'>Caria</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kaunos?lang=en'>Caunus</a>. They were not, however, alone. In this last phase of the conflict, almost all of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyprus?lang=en'>Cyprus</a> also rebelled against the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Onesilus?lang=en'>Onesilus</a>, the younger brother of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gorgus?lang=en'>Gorgus</a>, the ruler of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Salamis</a>, tried to convince his brother to rebel against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persia</a> and join in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionian_Revolt?lang=en'>Ionian Revolt</a>. When his brother refused to support the revolt, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Onesilus?lang=en'>Onesilus</a> waited until he left <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Salamis</a> and then shut the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> gates on him. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gorgus?lang=en'>Gorgus</a> fled to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> while <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Onesilus?lang=en'>Onesilus</a> took over and convinced the Cyprians to revolt. They then proceeded to lay <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Siege?lang=en'>siege</a> to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amathus?lang=en'>Amathus</a>.[20]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>’ account is the best source we have on the events that amounted to a collision between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persia</a>, which was expanding westward, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>classical Greece</a> at its peak. Nevertheless its depictions are often scanty and uncertain, or incomplete. One of the major uncertainties of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionian_Revolt?lang=en'>Ionian revolt</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> is why it occurred in the first place.
<br>
<br>In retrospect the case seems obvious: <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persia</a> disputed the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Hellenes</a> for control of cities and territories. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Hellenes</a> had either to fight for their freedom or submit. The desirability of these material objects was certainly economic, although considerations of defense and ideology may well have played a part. These are the motives generally accepted today, after long retrospect.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> apparently knew of no such motives, or if he did, he did not care to analyse history at that level. J D <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johns_Manville?lang=en'>Manville</a> characterizes his approach as the attribution of “personal motivation” to players such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a>. In his view, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> “may seem to overemphasize personal motivation as a cause,” but he really does not. We have either to fault <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> for his lack of analytical perspicacity or try to find credible reasons in the historical context for actions to which <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> gives incomplete explanations.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johns_Manville?lang=en'>Manville</a> suggests that the unexplained places mark events in a secret scenario about which <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> could not have known, but he records what he does know <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flat_module?lang=en'>faithfully</a>. It is up to the historian to reconstruct the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Secret_history?lang=en'>secret history</a> by re-interpretation and speculation, a technique often used by historical novelists. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johns_Manville?lang=en'>Manville</a> puts it forward as history.
<br>
<br>The main players are portrayed by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> as naturally hypocritical. They always have an ulterior motive which they go to great <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse_length?lang=en'>lengths</a> to conceal behind persuasive lies. Thus neither <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> nor <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a> are fighting for freedom, nor do they cooperate or collaborate. Each has a personal motive related to greed, ambition, or fear. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johns_Manville?lang=en'>Manville</a> fills in the uncertainties with hypothetical motives. Thus he arrives, perhaps less credibly for his invention, at a behind-the-scenes struggle for dominance between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a>. They can best be described as rivals or even enemies.[21] Some of the high points of the argument are as follows.
<br>
<br>While <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a> was away serving <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> acted in his stead as deputy of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a> where, it is argued, he worked on securing his own power. The word for deputy is <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Regent?lang=en'>epitropos</a>, which he was when the Naxian deputation arrived. By the time the fleet departs for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naxos?lang=en'>Naxos</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> has promoted himself to “<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tyrant?lang=en'>tyrant</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a>.” There is no explicit statement that he asked <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a>’ permission or was promoted by Histaeus. Instead, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> turned to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaphernes?lang=en'>Artaphernes</a>, who was said to be jealous of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a>. It is true that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaphernes?lang=en'>Artaphernes</a> would not move without consulting the Great King, and that the latter’s advisor on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> affairs was <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a>. However, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johns_Manville?lang=en'>Manville</a> sees a coup by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a>, presuming not only that the Great King’s advisor did not advise, but was kept in the dark about his own supersession.
<br>
<br>When the expedition failed, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a> sent his tattooed slave to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a>, not as encouragement to revolt, but as an ultimatum. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johns_Manville?lang=en'>Manville</a> provides an underlying value system to fill in the gap left by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>: revolt was so <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Unthinkable?lang=en'>unthinkable</a> that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a> could bring the fantasies of his opponent back to reality by suggesting that he do it, a sort of “go ahead, commit <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suicide?lang=en'>suicide</a>.” <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a> was, in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johns_Manville?lang=en'>Manville</a>’s speculation, ordering <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> to give up his rule or suffer the consequences. Apparently, he was not being kept in the dark by the king after all. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johns_Manville?lang=en'>Manville</a> leaves us to guess why the king did not just crush the revolt by returning the supposedly loyal <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a> to power.
<br>
<br>However, at this time <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a> was still required to remain in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susa?lang=en'>Susa</a> and, despite his threat, he was unable to do anything if <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> did revolt. Realizing that this would be his last chance to gain power <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> started the revolt despite <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a>’ threat. This is a surprise to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johns_Manville?lang=en'>Manville</a>’s readers, as we thought he already had power via a coup. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johns_Manville?lang=en'>Manville</a> does note the contradiction mentioned above, that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> gave up tyranny, yet was able to force <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democracy?lang=en'>democracy</a> on the other cities and command their obedience to him. We are to see in this <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paradox?lang=en'>paradox</a> a strategy to depose <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a>, whom we thought was already deposed.
<br>
<br>The tale goes on to an attempt by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a> to form an alliance with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaphernes?lang=en'>Artaphernes</a> to depose the usurper and regain his power at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaphernes?lang=en'>Artaphernes</a>, though he was involved in open war with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a>, refuses.[22] The tale told by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johns_Manville?lang=en'>Manville</a> thus contains events related by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> supplemented by non-events coming from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johns_Manville?lang=en'>Manville</a>’s imagination.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Myres?lang=en'>John Myres</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_archaeology?lang=en'>classical archaeologist</a> and scholar, whose career began in the reign of Queen <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Queen_Victoria?lang=en'>Victoria</a> and did not end until 1954, close friend and companion of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arthur_Evans?lang=en'>Arthur Evans</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Intelligence?lang=en'>intelligence</a> officer par excellence of the British <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire?lang=en'>Empire</a>, developed a theory of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionian_Revolt?lang=en'>Ionian Revolt</a> that explains it in terms of the stock political views of the empire, balance of power and power <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Power_vacuum?lang=en'>vacuum</a>. Those views, still generally familiar, assert that peace is to be found in a region controlled by competing geopolitical powers, none of which are strong enough to defeat the others. If a power drops from the roster for any reason, a “<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Power_vacuum?lang=en'>vacuum</a>” then exists, which causes violent competition until the balance is readjusted.
<br>
<br>In a key article of 1906, while <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Godfrey_Evans?lang=en'>Evans</a> was excavating <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Knossos?lang=en'>Knossos</a>, the Ottoman <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire?lang=en'>Empire</a> had lost <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crete?lang=en'>Crete</a> due to British intervention, and questions of the “sick man of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe?lang=en'>Europe</a>” were being considered by all the powers, referring to the failing Ottoman <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire?lang=en'>Empire</a> and the power <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Power_vacuum?lang=en'>vacuum</a> that would be left when it fell, the young Myres published an article studying the balance of what he termed “sea-power” in the eastern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mediterranean_Sea?lang=en'>Mediterranean</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_antiquity?lang=en'>classical</a> times. The word "sea-power" was intended to define his “<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thalassocracy?lang=en'>thalassocracy</a>.”
<br>
<br>Myres was using sea-power in a specifically British sense for the times. The Americans had their own idea of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Command_of_the_sea?lang=en'>sea power</a>, expressed in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alfred_the_Great?lang=en'>Alfred</a> Thayer <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alfred_Thayer_Mahan?lang=en'>Mahan</a>’s great strategic work, ‘’The Influence of Sea Power upon History’’. which advocated maintaining a powerful navy and using it for strategic purposes, such as “command of the sea,” a kind of domination. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Naval_Academy?lang=en'>United States Naval Academy</a> used this meaning for its motto, ‘’ex scientia tridens’’, “sea-power through knowledge.” It named one of its buildings, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alfred_Thayer_Mahan?lang=en'>Mahan</a> Hall.
<br>
<br>Far different is Myres’ “sea-power” and the meaning of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thalassocracy?lang=en'>thalassocracy</a>, which means “rule of the seas.“ In contrast to “tridens,” rule of the seas is not a paternalistic but democratic arrangement. Where there are rulers, there are the ruled. A kind of exclusivity is meant, such as in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rule,_Britannia!?lang=en'>Rule, Britannia!</a>. Specifically, in a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thalassocracy?lang=en'>thalassocracy</a>, the fleets of the ruler may go where they will and do as they please, but the ruled may go nowhere and engage in no operation without express permission of the ruler. You need a license, so to speak, to be on ruled waters, and if you do not have it, your ships are attacked and destroyed. “Shoot on sight” is the policy. And so <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carthage?lang=en'>Carthaginian</a> ships sank any ships in their waters, etc.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thalassocracy?lang=en'>Thalassocracy</a> was a new word in the theories of the late 19th century, from which some conclude it was a scholarly innovation of the times. It was rather a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Resurrection_of_Jesus?lang=en'>resurrection</a> of a word known from a very specific <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_antiquity?lang=en'>classical</a> document, which Myres calls “the List of Thalassocracies.” It occurs in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thietmar_of_Merseburg?lang=en'>Chronicon</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eusebius?lang=en'>Eusebius</a>, the early 4th century Bishop of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caesarea_Maritima?lang=en'>Caesarea Maritima</a>, the ruins now in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Israel?lang=en'>Israel</a>.[23] In <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eusebius?lang=en'>Eusebius</a>, the list is a separate chronology. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jerome?lang=en'>Jerome</a>, 4th-century <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theology?lang=en'>theologian</a> and historian, creator of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vulgate?lang=en'>Vulgate</a>, interspersed the same items, translated into <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin?lang=en'>Latin</a>, in his <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thietmar_of_Merseburg?lang=en'>Chronicon</a> of world events.[24] The items contain the words “obtinuerunt <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mare?lang=en'>mare</a>,” <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strictly_Speaking?lang=en'>strictly speaking</a>, “obtained the sea,” and not “hold <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Command_of_the_sea?lang=en'>sea power</a>,” although the latter meaning may be implied as a result. Just as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jerome?lang=en'>Jerome</a> utilized the chronology of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eusebius?lang=en'>Eusebius</a>, so <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eusebius?lang=en'>Eusebius</a> utilized the chronology of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Castor_of_Rhodes?lang=en'>Castor</a> of Rhodes, a 1st-century BC historian. His work has been entirely lost except for fragments, including his list of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thalassocracy?lang=en'>thalassocracies</a>. A thousand years later, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Byzantine_Empire?lang=en'>Byzantine</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monk?lang=en'>monk</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Syncellus?lang=en'>George Syncellus</a>, also used items from the list in his massive Extract of Chronography.
<br>
<br>Over the centuries the realization grew that all these references to sea-power in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegean_Sea?lang=en'>Aegean</a> came from a single document, a resource now reflected in the fragments of those who relied on it. C <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_Charles_Josias_von_Bunsen?lang=en'>Bunsen</a>, whose translator was one of the first to use <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thalassocracy?lang=en'>thalassocracy</a>, attributed its discovery to the German scholar, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_Gottlob_Heyne?lang=en'>Christian Gottlob Heyne</a>[25] In a short work composed in 1769, published in 1771,[26] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chronicon_(Eusebius)?lang=en'>Eusebius' Chronicon</a> being known at that time only through fragments in the two authors mentioned, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_Gottlob_Heyne?lang=en'>Heyne</a> reconstructed the list in their Greek and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin?lang=en'>Latin</a> (with uncanny accuracy), the whole title of the article being Super Castoris epochis populorum thalattokratesanton H.E. (hoc est) qui <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Imperium?lang=en'>imperium</a> maris tenuisse dicuntur, “About <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Castor_of_Rhodes?lang=en'>Castor</a>’s epochs of thalattocratizing peoples; that is, those who are said to have held the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Imperium?lang=en'>imperium</a> over the sea.” To thalattokratize is “to rule the sea,” not just to hold <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Command_of_the_sea?lang=en'>sea power</a> like any other good fellow with a strong navy. The thalattokratizer holds the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Imperium?lang=en'>imperium</a> over the watery domain just as if it were a country, which explains how such a people can “obtain” and “have” the sea. The list presented therefore is one of successive exclusive domains. No two peoples can hold the same domain or share rule over it, although they can operate under the authority of the thalassocrat, a privilege reserved for paying allies.
<br>
<br>According to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Bunsen?lang=en'>Bunsen</a>, the discovery and translation of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armenian_language?lang=en'>Armenian</a> version of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chronicon_(Eusebius)?lang=en'>Eusebius' Chronicon</a> changed the nature of the search for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thalassocracy?lang=en'>thalassocracy</a>. It provided the original document, but there was a disclaimer attached, that it was in fact “an extract from the epitome of Diodorus,” meaning <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diodorus_Siculus?lang=en'>Diodorus Siculus</a>, a 1st century BC historian. The disclaimer cannot be verified, as that part of Diodorus’ work is missing, which, however, opens the argument to another question: if <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eusebius?lang=en'>Eusebius</a> could copy a standard source from Diodorus, why cannot Diodorus have copied it from someone else?
<br>
<br>It is at this point that Myres picks up the argument. Noting that thalassokratesai, “be a thalassokrat,” meaning “rule the waves,” was used in a number of authors: elsewhere by Diodorus, by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polybius?lang=en'>Polybius</a>, 2nd century BC historian, of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carthage?lang=en'>Carthage</a>, of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chios?lang=en'>Chios</a> by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strabo?lang=en'>Strabo</a>, 1st century BC geographer and some others, he supposes that s stock document might have been available to them all (but not necessarily, the cautious Myres points out).[27] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Document?lang=en'>The document</a> can be dated by its content: a list of 17 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thalassocracy?lang=en'>thalassocracies</a> extending from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lydia?lang=en'>Lydian</a> after the fall of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Troy?lang=en'>Troy</a> to the Aeginetan, which ended with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cession?lang=en'>cession</a> of power to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> in 480 BC. The Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Salamis</a> included 200 new <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Athenian</a> triremes plus all the ships of its new ally, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegina?lang=en'>Aegina</a>. Despite various revolts <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegina?lang=en'>Aegina</a> went on to become part of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Delian League</a>, an imperial treaty of the new <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Athenian</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thalassocracy?lang=en'>thalassocracy</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> writes of it after 432 BC, but <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, who visited <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> “as late as 444 B.C.” does not know a thing about it. This tentative date for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eusebius?lang=en'>Eusebian</a> list does not exclude the possibility of an earlier similar document used by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>.[28]
<br>
<br>The order of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thalassocracy?lang=en'>thalassocracies</a> in the various versions of the list is nearly fixed, but the dates need considerable adjustment, which Myres sets about to reconcile through all historical sources available to him. He discovers some gaps. The solidest part of the list brackets the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionian_Revolt?lang=en'>Ionian Revolt</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Milesian</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thalassocracy?lang=en'>thalassocracy</a> is dated 604-585 BC. It was ended by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alyattes_of_Lydia?lang=en'>Alyattes</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lydia?lang=en'>Lydia</a>, founder of the Lydian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire?lang=en'>Empire</a>, who also fought against the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a>. The latter struggle was ended by the Eclipse of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thales?lang=en'>Thales</a> at the Battle of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kızılırmak_River?lang=en'>Halys River</a> in 585 BC, when the combatants, interpreting the phenomenon as a sign, made peace. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lydia?lang=en'>Lydians</a> were now free to turn on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a>, which they did for the next 11 years, reducing it. When the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> conquered <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lydia?lang=en'>Lydia</a> in 547/546 they acquired the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionian</a> cities.
<br>
<br>After 585 is a gap in the list. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lesbos?lang=en'>Lesbos</a> and one or more unknown thalassocrats held the sea in unknown order.[29] In 577 began the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thalassocracy?lang=en'>thalassocracy</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phocaea?lang=en'>Phocaea</a>. Breaking out of its Anatolian cage, it founded <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marseille?lang=en'>Marseilles</a> and cities in Spain and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italian_Peninsula?lang=en'>Italy</a>, wresting a domain away from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carthage?lang=en'>Carthage</a> and all other opponents.[30] Their <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thalassocracy?lang=en'>thalassocracy</a> ended when, in the revolt of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lydia?lang=en'>Lydian</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pactyes?lang=en'>Pactyas</a>, who had been instructed to collect taxes by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a>, but used them to raise an army of revolt, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionians?lang=en'>Ionian</a> cities were attacked by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phocaea?lang=en'>Phocaeans</a> abandoned <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phocaea?lang=en'>Phocaea</a> about <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/534_BC?lang=en'>534 BC</a> and after much adventuring settled in the west.
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thalassocracy?lang=en'>thalassocracy</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samos?lang=en'>Samos</a> spans the career of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tyrant?lang=en'>tyrant</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polycrates?lang=en'>Polycrates</a>, there.[31] The dates of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tyrant?lang=en'>tyrant</a> are somewhat uncertain and variable, but at some time prior to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/534_BC?lang=en'>534 BC</a>, he and his brothers staged a coup during a festival at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samos?lang=en'>Samos</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samos?lang=en'>Samos</a> happened to have a large navy of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Penteconter?lang=en'>pentekonters</a>. Becoming a ship collector, he attacked and subdued all the neighbouring islands, adding their ships to his fleet. Finally he added a new model, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trireme?lang=en'>trireme</a>. His reign came to an end about 517 BC when, taking up the Great King’s invitation to a friendly banquet for a discussion of prospects, he was suddenly assassinated. There were no prospects.
<br>
<br>However, if he had chosen not to attend, he was doomed anyway. Some of his <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trireme?lang=en'>trireme</a> captains, learning of a devious plot by him to have them assassinated by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Egyptian</a> dignitaries while on official business, sailed to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> to beg help, which they received. The adventurous young king, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cleomenes_I?lang=en'>Cleomenes I</a>, was spared the trouble of killing <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polycrates?lang=en'>Polycrates</a>, but led an expedition to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samos?lang=en'>Samos</a> anyway, taking the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thalassocracy?lang=en'>thalassocracy</a> for two years, 517-515. Adventure and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piracy?lang=en'>piracy</a> not being activities approved by the Spartan people, they tagged him as insane and insisted he come home.[32] The sea was now available to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naxos?lang=en'>Naxos</a>, 515-505.
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Hellenes</a> had obtained a foothold on the coast of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a> by siding with rebel coastal Anatolian states against the Hittite <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire?lang=en'>Empire</a>.[33] Their position was made more solid by the fall of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Troy?lang=en'>Troy</a> against a coalition of mainland <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> kings. The coastal cities managed to retain their positions against the subsequent <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phrygia?lang=en'>Phrygian</a> invasion of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a> by joining with the rump Anatolian states, while the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hittites?lang=en'>Hittites</a> withdrew into <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syro-Hittite_states?lang=en'>neo-Hittite</a> states in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syria?lang=en'>Syria</a>. The coastal cities, now entirely <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Hellenic</a>, continued to receive immigrants from mainland <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Massive_(comics)?lang=en'>The massive</a> transfer of Persian-speaking population from the steppes of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_Asia?lang=en'>Central Asia</a> to the range they now occupy presented the Anatolian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Hellenes</a> with an impossible strategic problem. They could not hope to oppose their small armies against the resources of the vast <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> empire unless they could once again receive major support from the mainland <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> states, especially the maritime power of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>. Those states, however, were reluctant to take on the might of ancient <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persia</a>.
<br>
<br>Consequently the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Hellenic</a> states in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a> submitted reluctantly to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> rule, and were placed in the new <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satrap?lang=en'>satrapy</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lydia?lang=en'>Lydia</a>, with capital at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sardis?lang=en'>Sardis</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satrap?lang=en'>satrap</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lydia?lang=en'>Lydia</a> allowed self-rule as long as taxes were paid and the supremacy of ancient <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persia</a> was granted. Many of the Anatolian cities proved loyal subjects. However, underlying resentment against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> rule was universal.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persia</a> was not interested in the status <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quo_(Status_Quo_album)?lang=en'>quo</a>. Their desire to expand to the west brought them into conflict with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a> over the question of self-rule, one of the principles of the agreement of the city-states to submit. Their interference in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a> was the spark that set off the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionian_Revolt?lang=en'>Ionian revolt</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a>, the first rebel ruler, appeared then as the champion of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> freedom. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionians?lang=en'>Ionians</a> had high hopes of independence.
<br>
<br>Due to the disparity in resources and the reluctance of the mainland states to involve themselves, the tide soon turned in favour of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a>. After only one year, the Cyprians were once again forced into submission by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persia</a>. The cities around the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dardanelles?lang=en'>Hellespont</a> fell one after another to Daurises, the son-in-law of king <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carians?lang=en'>Carians</a> fought the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> at the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Büyük_Menderes_River?lang=en'>Maeander River</a> and were defeated with severe casualties.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a>, seeing the rebellion falling to pieces around him, and little help forthcoming from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>, began looking for a shelter to which he could execute a strategic retreat. He and his men resolved on Myrcinus in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrace?lang=en'>Thrace</a>, which had been an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionian</a> stronghold in the abortive <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> invasion of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythia?lang=en'>Scythia</a>. He put <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pythagoras?lang=en'>Pythagoras</a>, “a man of distinction,” in charge of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a> and set sail for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrace?lang=en'>Thrace</a>, where he attempted to establish a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colonies_in_antiquity?lang=en'>colony</a> on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Struma_(river)?lang=en'>Strymon</a> river, at the same site as the later <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athenian</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colonies_in_antiquity?lang=en'>colony</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amphipolis?lang=en'>Amphipolis</a>.
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrace?lang=en'>Thracians</a>, not now disposed to tolerate any further presence of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> in their country, opposed this incursion. He gained control of the territory but later, while besieging a neighbouring town, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> was killed in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a>.[34]
<br>
<br>Expecting a swift <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> victory, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> had hoped to establish a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Redoubt?lang=en'>redoubt</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionians?lang=en'>Ionians</a>, who would come to the assistance of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a> at a later time.[35] By an accidental sequence of historical events his reputation drew the ire of his main historian, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> of Halicarnassus, an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionians?lang=en'>Ionian</a> partisan, to such a degree that it suffers yet. Although a champion of freedom, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> is the only man in all his histories that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> openly calls a coward, blaming his supposed flight for the defeat of the revolt. The revolt apparently intensified and spread into the islands. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> had no way of knowing that he would have been in the van of it, or that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrace?lang=en'>Thracians</a> would not allow a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Redoubt?lang=en'>redoubt</a>.
<br>
<br>The revolt was over by 494/493 BC. Going directly for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a> in 494, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> defeated the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionians?lang=en'>Ionians</a> with their own weapon, the ship, in the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Lade</a>, an island off <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> was then subject to a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Siege?lang=en'>siege</a> and the war lost at its fall. Although there was some mild devastation of rebel cities (except for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a>, which was razed and the population decimated and transported), the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> were interested in ruling rather than revenge. They began to plan forthwith for the largest invasion of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> yet undertaken, executed starting 490 BC in a series of conflicts called the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greco-Persian_Wars?lang=en'>Greco-Persian Wars</a>, which are yet famous. Unfortunately for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a>, they were forced to adopt contingents of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionian Greeks</a> into their armies and navies.
<br>
<br>Most of the information on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> and his actions comes from the writings of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>ancient Greek</a> historian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>. On the one hand he is virtually the only literary source for the events he presents as history. While in many ways he reflects some of the best of ancient <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Historiography?lang=en'>historiography</a>, on the other hand, his work is sprinkled with motivational and logical <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Non_liquet?lang=en'>lacunae</a>, creating textual paradoxes everywhere, causing some scholars to be critical of his value as a historical source, especially regarding the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionian_Revolt?lang=en'>Ionian Revolt</a>. For purposes of this presentation, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textual_criticism?lang=en'>textual criticism</a> may be polarized into two camps: the cynical, discrediting <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> as an unreliable source, and the affirmative, which credits him with being reliable as far as he goes.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johns_Manville?lang=en'>Manville</a>'s cynical view concerning an imaginary power struggle between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a> isolated from the usual contexts of war and society has already been mentioned above. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johns_Manville?lang=en'>Manville</a> has no confidence in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>' ability to relate connected history and therefore supplies connections for him out of his own speculations. He was preceded in this method by the earlier work of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mabel_Lang?lang=en'>Mabel Lang</a>. A 1968 article by Lang focuses on the paradoxes of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionian_Revolt?lang=en'>Ionian revolt</a>. For example, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a> originally won the Great King's favor by protecting his escape from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythia?lang=en'>Scythia</a> over a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Key_Bridge_(Washington,_D.C.)?lang=en'>key bridge</a> of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Danube?lang=en'>Danube</a>.[36] Despite this vital rescue to save the king and all his forces, he shortly after plots a rebellion!
<br>
<br>Lang suggests that one might conclude to an ulterior motive at the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bridge?lang=en'>bridge</a>, "to ingratiate himself with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> so that he could be on the inside of the king's policy."[37] Apparently, to be on the inside of his policy he has to save his life and the lives of all his army by letting him escape from the large <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythians?lang=en'>Scythian</a> army not far behind. He prefers to keep him alive for nothing more serious than keeping an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eye?lang=en'>eye</a> on him. Nonchalantly Lang writes: "Presumably revolt was already in the air,...." It could not have been far in the air if <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Histiaeus?lang=en'>Histiaeus</a> passed up a chance for total victory at the outset, a prized goal of many a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lightning?lang=en'>lightning</a> campaign in world history afterwards.
<br>
<br>The basic problem is Lang's cynicism: "we should not hope to discover the truth about the result merely by accepting the narrative ...."[38] Accordingly she rehearses a catalogue of paradoxes similar to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johns_Manville?lang=en'>Manville</a>'s <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Weaving?lang=en'>weaving</a> her own <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fantasy?lang=en'>fantasy</a> of unattested events to contain it. Her explanation of why such a tale is necessary is similarly speculative: "the failure of the revolt not only gave prominence to every aspect and event which would explain, justify or anticipate the disastrous results but also cast into the shade any intentions which deserved a better fate and any temporary successes during the course of the war." Not having any other account with which to compare these events, she cannot possibly know that.
<br>
<br>The cynical view described above reflects a difference in expectation between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> and his target audiences, which by the accidents of time are multiple and various. He did not write for us moderns. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reading_railway_station?lang=en'>Reading</a> that he was the first historian whose work survived in anything more than scattered fragments, we expect him to have the proper concern of modern historians for continuity and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Causality?lang=en'>causality</a>, which other ancient historians, such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>, have. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> is not one of those. With regard to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Causality?lang=en'>causation</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Cambridge_Ancient_History?lang=en'>Cambridge Ancient History</a> article asserts: “...<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> does not seem to have innovated: he merely accepted the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Causality?lang=en'>causation</a> appropriate to his subject and period.”[39]
<br>
<br>It would be convenient to attribute this unconcern to a sort of intermediate phase between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mythology?lang=en'>mythology</a> and history, as many do. Such a view is neglectful of the ravages of time. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> was not the first historian in any way, only the first whose work survived. He wrote of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionian_Revolt?lang=en'>Ionian Revolt</a> a full generation after it happened; moreover, he was not a participant. He relied on the work of several previous historians at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a>, of which fragments and mention have survived, chief of which was <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hecataeus_of_Miletus?lang=en'>Hecataeus</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a>.[40]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> apparently designed his work according to a specific plan and style. Whether the previous historians used it is not known, due to the paucity of evidence, but it seems unlikely. He appears to use <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hecataeus_of_Miletus?lang=en'>Hecataeus</a> as a framework for his historical events. The fragments of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hecataeus_of_Miletus?lang=en'>Hecataeus</a> suggest that he wrote only an annal-like sequence long on names and events but short on connecting narrative. To this framework <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Applied_Digital_Data_Systems?lang=en'>adds</a> the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Logos?lang=en'>logoi</a>, or independent anecdotes of persons and events derived from independent oral traditions, which <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> obtained by interview with record-keepers and state historians. The disconnectedness comes from their being independent. It is pointless, therefore, to try to invent connections.[41]
<br>
<br>The ancient historians have therefore invented a special category for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, that he was a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Logographer_(legal)?lang=en'>logographer</a>, or teller of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Logos?lang=en'>logoi</a>, based on his own characterization of his sources as logopoioi, “story makers.” Usually the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Logographer_(history)?lang=en'>logographers</a> include <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hecataeus_of_Miletus?lang=en'>Hecataeus</a> and the other historians of his generation, who lived through the revolt. There is little evidence of their <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Logogram?lang=en'>logography</a>. Whether <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> stands alone or is part of a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Milesian</a> tradition is a matter of speculation.
<br>
<br>Validation of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> therefore rests on validation of his <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Logos?lang=en'>logoi</a>. There is no general validation, but the much-desired archaeological and inscriptional evidence appears to validate a few events as far as they go: some names, circumstances of war, and similar peripheral facts. He cannot be validated as a modern historian, but he does have an overall design, which is “Biblical” or “Bible-like” in scope. He is trying to do an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epic_poetry?lang=en'>epic</a> in prose similar to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer?lang=en'>Homerica</a> in verse. His topic is not the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trojan_War?lang=en'>Trojan War</a>, but the Graeco-Persian Wars. (The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer?lang=en'>Homerica</a> have been called the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paganism?lang=en'>pagan</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> “<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bible?lang=en'>Bible</a>.") Says <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oswyn_Murray?lang=en'>Oswyn Murray</a> in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Cambridge_Ancient_History?lang=en'>Cambridge Ancient History</a>,[42]
<br>
<br>It is certainly hard to find fault with his general view that the only adequate explanation for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greco-Persian_Wars?lang=en'>Persian Wars</a> must be a complete account of relations between the two peoples since the conquest of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionians?lang=en'>Ionian</a> cities in 545 B.C.
<br>
<br>In short, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> is personal because the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer?lang=en'>Homerica</a> are personal. Both genres intend to portray the illustrious or non-illustrius deeds and doings of persons in the contexts of mighty wars. Thus <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristagoras?lang=en'>Aristagoras</a> personally can be called a “coward.” The lying that they do is metis, “cunning,”[43] an admired <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greek?lang=en'>Greek</a> virtue practised by the greatest hero of them all, the crafty <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Odysseus?lang=en'>Odysseus</a>. The literary tradition of it went on. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Virgil?lang=en'>Virgil</a> could include the half-line Timeo Graecos dona ferentes, “I fear <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greeks_Bearing_Gifts_(Torchwood)?lang=en'>Greeks bearing Gifts</a>,” in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aeneid?lang=en'>Aeneid</a>.
<br>
<br>The expectation of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Modernity?lang=en'>modernity</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> is misplaced. Validation must be sought for individual <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Logos?lang=en'>logoi</a>. The whole work or any part of it cannot logically be condemned on the basis of one or a group of paradoxes. All scepticism must have a reason for doubting. The inconsistencies of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> are not a valid reason, which is generally true. But few stories are ever free of inconsistency, and if they are, they are suspect on that account (“too good to be true”).
<br>
<br>Denials of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>' validity, from mild to severe, although widespread, were never universal. As an example of ancient information generally agreed to be invalid, many works attributed to various authors have been placed in the "pseudo-" category after as much as centuries of review. There was never any such universal and long-standing denial of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>. On the contrary, the main events, such as the Battles of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Marathon</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a>, have been accepted as basically credible by many scholars of many ages. It is therefore misplaced to speak of the "rehabilitation" of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> in medical or neo-ideologic terms.
<br>
<br>Accordingly the most sanguine view treats his work as though no problems exist regarding it. Referring to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Cambridge_Ancient_History?lang=en'>Cambridge Ancient History</a> article on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionian_Revolt?lang=en'>Ionian Revolt</a> by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murray_River?lang=en'>Murray</a>, Georges addresses "the question of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>' veracity and reliability."[44] Repeating <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murray_River?lang=en'>Murray</a>'s criticism that "the traditions concerning the revolt itself are ... fragmented into individual episodes of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Folly?lang=en'>folly</a>, treachery, or heroism" and therefore are not "trustworthy materials for the history of the revolt," he asserts to the contrary that "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>' account furnishes the material for a coherent and credible account of the actions and events it presents ...."
<br>
<br>Having said this, Georges must now show that, rather than being paradoxical, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> is coherent and credible. Like Lang, having no other account to offer, he must make his demonstrations from the text of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, which he spends the rest of the article doing, disputing most of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murray_River?lang=en'>Murray</a>'s interpretations. The contradictions are not to be viewed as contradictions. He does not address the question of why, if they are not so, it is necessary to spend an article in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Disputation?lang=en'>disputation</a> over them. The result is a new set of speculations fully as imaginary as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murray_River?lang=en'>Murray</a>'s, not being based on any alternative texts.
<br>
<br>There is hope, however, as fragments of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language?lang=en'>Greek</a> texts and inscriptions continue to be discovered. Meanwhile it seems common knowledge that the public of any age is not going to relinquish credibility in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>' great depiction of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greco-Persian_Wars?lang=en'>Persian Wars</a>
