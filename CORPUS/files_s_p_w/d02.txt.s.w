Battle of Thermopylae, Battle in northern Ancient_Greece (480 BC) in the Greco-Persian_Wars. Ten years after the defeat at Battle_of_Marathon, the Achaemenid_Empire invasion of Ancient_Greece was resumed by Xerxes_IXerxes_I0 Common_Era. A Spartan-led Ancient_Greece army led by Leonidas_I tried to block the Achaemenid_Empire advance at the pass of Thermopylae but was defeated despite brave resistance against overwhelming odds. After three days of holding their own against the Achaemenid_Empire Xerxes_IXerxes_Iis vast southward-advancing army, the Ancient_Greece were betrayed, and the Achaemenid_Empire were able to outflank them. Sending the main army in retreat, Leonidas_I and a small contingent remained behind to resist the advance and were killed to the last man.

Achaemenid_Empire Xerxes_IXerxes_Ied a vast army overland from the Dardanelles, accompanied by a substantial fleet moving along the coast. His forces quickly seized northern Ancient_Greece. The alliance of Ancient_Greece city-states, led by Classical_Athens and Sparta, then tried to halt Achaemenid_Empire progress on land at the narrow pass of Thermopylae and at sea nearby in the straits of Battle_of_Artemisium.

The Ancient_Greece army was led by the Spartan king, Leonidas_I. He had perhaps 7,000 men and faced some 70,000 enemies. The armored Ancient_Greece infantry held a line only a few dozen yards long between a steep hillside and the sea. This constricted battlefield prevented the Achaemenid_Empire bringing their superior numbers to bear. The Ancient_Greece threw back two days of fierce Achaemenid_Empire attacks, imposing heavy casualties while suffering relatively light losses themselves. Xerxes_I despaired of a breakthrough until he learned of a hill path that his troops could use to outflank the enemy line. On the third day, the Achaemenid_Empire attacked via this route, brushed aside the Ancient_Greece flank guard, and annihilated the parts of the Ancient_Greece army that did not withdraw in time.

Leonidas_I and his 300-man bodyguard are said to have refused to retreat because it was contrary to Spartan law and custom. They staged a final Kamikaze in which they were wiped out. Meanwhile, the largely Classical_Athens Ancient_Greece naval force received news of the defeat at Thermopylae and withdrew from Battle_of_Artemisium after a drawn Battle with the Achaemenid_Empire
