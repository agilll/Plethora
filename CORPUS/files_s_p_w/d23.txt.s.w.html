<span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> (c. 555-489 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>) was the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> general who defeated the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> in 490 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> faced a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> force of superior numbers led by the commanding <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>admiral</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Admiral</b></span> Datis, who had been sent by their king <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> (549-486 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>) to invade and subjugate <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. At the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> recognized that traditional <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> strategy would never succeed against the larger <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> force and adopted a completely unexpected  tactic which broke the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> lines, won the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, and saved <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> domination.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> was the son of  <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, an aristocratic charioteer well known for his success in the Olympics. <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span> was a  member of the wealthy and highly regarded <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Philaid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Philaidae</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>clan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Clan</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> was educated by the best teachers and groomed for success in politics. He inherited a kingdom in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> in his twenties when his brother, Stesagoras, died without any children to leave his estate to. This kingdom was in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chersonese</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gallipoli</b></span>, north of the site of ancient <span style='color: blue'><b>Troy</b></span>, and had proved a very prosperous holding for <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span>' family. The people, however, had grown tired of the rule of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Philaid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Philaidae</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>clan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Clan</b></span> prior to his brother's death. They hoped, in fact, that since their king had died without an heir, they would now be left to govern themselves; but this was not to be.
<br>
<br>When <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> arrived in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chersonese</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gallipoli</b></span>, he already knew that he would have trouble with the people and expected tiresome visits from the elders of the community who would attempt to repeatedly outwit and manipulate him. He had no interest in letting them waste his time and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>energy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Energy</b></span>, and so when he took up residence in his new palace, he closed all his doors and shutters and refused to go out among the people, acting as though he was in mourning for the death of his brother.
<br>
<br>When the Chersonesian elders came to his home in a group to offer their condolences on his loss, <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> had his guards arrest them on charges of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>treason</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Treason</b></span>. The elders were imprisoned, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> then set about governing his new kingdom without further interference or annoyance. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> claims that, unlike his uncle or brother before him, <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> saw what needed to be done and did it; thus securing his rule of the kingdom quickly. He consolidated his position soon after this by marrying a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thracian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thrace</b></span> princess named Hegesipyle, daughter of the neighboring king <span style='color: blue'><b>Olorus</b></span>, sealing an alliance against any future troubles.
<br>
<br>Whatever poor policies his brother and uncle had enacted <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> avoided, and proved himself an effective ruler. He defeated the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Scythian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Scythians</b></span> invaders who made regular incursions into the kingdom and conquered the islands of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lemnos</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Imbros</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Tenedos</b></span> for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, which greatly elevated his status and that of his kingdom. In 513 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> invaded, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> surrendered accepting his new position as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vassal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vassal</b></span> to the Persian <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span>. In this capacity, he had no choice but to join his new ruler in an expedition against the <span style='color: blue'><b>Scythians</b></span>, and then against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek colonies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Colonies_in_antiquity</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>. These colonies revolted against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule in 499 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> supported them secretly and helped with dispensing further aid from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>.
<br>
<br>When the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> put down the revolt in c. 495 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span>' part in the troubles was revealed, and he fled to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> for safety. His son Metiochus was captured by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> at this time but, because he came of a noble house of a former <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vassal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vassal</b></span>, his life was spared and he lived very comfortably as a prince in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> was pursued by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenician</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span> allies of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> but evaded them. He reached <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> with the rest of his family, where he was welcomed but then almost instantly brought up on charges of tyranny stemming from his reign in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chersonese</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gallipoli</b></span>. The Athenians dismissed the charges as fabrications of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> sympathizers, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> and his family settled into the comfortable life of upper class <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> could not abide the arrogance of the Athenians or the insult of the colonies' revolt. He sent emissaries to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states demanding their submission to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule. Almost all of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> states refused him, but the island of <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span> agreed and became a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vassal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vassal</b></span> state. <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span>, centrally located between <span style='color: blue'><b>Piraeus</b></span> - the port of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> - and <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> - an important trade center near <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> - threatened the commerce of both city-states as a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vassal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vassal</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> demanded that <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span> withdrew its pledge to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> king, but <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span> refused. The tensions between the city-states flared and gave <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> the excuse he needed to invade <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> in order to protect his new <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vassal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vassal</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> knew that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> had been behind the rebellion and, of course, that they had welcomed <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span>, who had betrayed him. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> sent his general <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> to the north of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, where he conquered the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Macedonians</b></span> region in 492 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> but lacked the men and resources to march south on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> itself. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> then decided to invade mainland <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and destroy <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> directly, eliminating any further threat to his control of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> and avenging himself for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>' <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>affront</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_civilisations_in_the_Culture_series</b></span> to his rule.
<br>
<br>The war between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and the Persian <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span> is often depicted strictly along nationalistic lines, where there were <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> on one side of the conflict and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> on the other, but this is not so. As the example of <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span> illustrates, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states were not unified as a nation, and there were many <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> who favored the unity and protection of the Persian <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span>. Although this may seem strange, that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> would prefer <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule, it must be remembered that the Persian <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span> was the greatest the world had known at the time while the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states were small, independent political units who fought incessantly with each other.
<br>
<br>There was no national <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army, economy, or even culture; each <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city-state</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Polis</b></span> considered itself a nation unto itself. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> offered a much more stable and all-encompassing <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>social construct</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Social_constructionism</b></span> than the city-states of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, and there were a number of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> who keenly appreciated this. When the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invaded <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> in 490 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, they were at first successful due to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>intelligence</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Espionage</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> sympathizers supplied them with. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> swiftly captured the strategically important island of <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>, then <span style='color: blue'><b>Delos</b></span>, and then <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>, whose gates were opened to them by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> supporters, and were then in position to invade the mainland at the port known as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> hastily mobilized their forces to repel the invasion but, as usual, lacked cohesion, and so a unified army was not ready at hand. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> army of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> was drawn from the citizenry and readied themselves quickly, but of the other city-states, only the Plataeans joined the resistance with a force of 400. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> could not participate because of a religious ritual (though they pledged to join as soon as they could), and the other city-states had their own obligations and problems which prevented them. <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> was one of ten generals commanding the largely <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> force which eventually marched to meet the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. Each day, one of the generals assumed supreme command of the army while a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>polemarch</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Polemarch</b></span> (a war counselor) named <span style='color: blue'><b>Callimachus</b></span>, who was not one of the ten, would oversee operations and render advice and decisions on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> plans.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> force under Datis numbered over 20,000 infantry with additional <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> and other units including archers. Their force also included the elite warriors known as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Immortals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_NCIS_episodes</b></span>, so called because when one fell another instantly took his place. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Immortals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_NCIS_episodes</b></span> were considered invincible. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, on the other hand, had only been able to muster 10,000 infantry and had neither <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> nor archers. The plains of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> were flat and well suited to a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> charge. The ground also favored the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> archers over the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> infantry.
<br>
<br>Historian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Kelly DeVries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kelly_DeVries</b></span> notes that "when the Athenians saw the immense size of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> force at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> they wavered in their decision to fight them there. A dispute arose in the war council between those who favored withdrawal, at least until the arrival of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, and those who desired to do <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>" (46-47). <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> was said to be on the march, and additional forces could arrive at any moment; some generals argued they should, therefore, delay any action. Other commanders pointed out how any traditional charge across the open ground at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, with or without reinforcements, would be extremely difficult because of the strength of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> and opportunities for their archers. The longer they argued, the stronger the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> position grew, they claimed, and an attack should be mounted without delay.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> favored the latter plan, and historians have speculated that he may have been motivated by revenge for having been driven from his kingdom by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>. The suggestion that they wait until reinforcements arrived from <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> was a reasonable one, and, as it turned out, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> reached <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> the day after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>. It has also been noted that <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> chose to press for the attack on a day when he would be the supreme commander and so would receive the glory of a decisive victory. His desire for revenge would be understandable, but this motivation as his sole reason for pressing for attack is only speculation. The generals' opinions on whether to attack or delay were divided - with five voting to attack and five to wait - until <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> appealed personally to <span style='color: blue'><b>Callimachus</b></span> to render a decision to break the tie. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> reports that <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> carefully explained the situation to <span style='color: blue'><b>Callimachus</b></span>, saying:
<br>
<br>If we do not fight, I look to see a great disturbance at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> which will shake men's resolutions, and then I fear they will submit themselves, but if we fight the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> before any unsoundness show itself among our citizens, let the gods but give us fair play, and we are able to overcome the enemy. On you therefore we depend in this matter, which lies wholly in your own power. You have only to add your vote to my side and your country will be free, and not free only, but the first state in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. Or, if you prefer to give your vote to them who would decline the combat, then the reverse will follow (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, 6.109).
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Callimachus</b></span> was persuaded and voted on <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span>' side. The army then began preparations for attack with <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> in command. The problem of how exactly to come at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> remained, however. To reach the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> lines, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> would have to cover over a mile (1.6 km) of open ground without cover, exposed to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> archers and at the mercy of their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>. At this same time, though, word reached <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> had largely taken ship to attack <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> while the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army was held at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> which had been left behind was only a fraction of the larger force which had faced the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> earlier. <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> knew this was the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>perfect time</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Perfect_Time</b></span> to strike.
<br>
<br>On the eleventh day of the stand-off,  <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> gave orders for the army to break traditional formation and spread themselves out in a thin line, perhaps three-men deep, across the opposing line of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. Traditionally, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> formation would have been a thickly clustered <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span> of warriors who would have marched steadily forward to the beat of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>drums</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Drum</b></span> and the sound of flutes. <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> changed all that; there would be no music and, further, the center of the line would be the weakest. Historians have debated on whether the weak center was intentional or simply the result of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span>' plan to stretch his line across the length of the much larger <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> front. It seems most likely that <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> intentionally weakened his center to draw the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> into a trap which was then closed by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek left</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_Left</b></span> and right wings.
<br>
<br>When his men were in position he commanded they run as fast as they could across the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Great_Plains</b></span> and attack the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. When the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> saw them coming, they only were aware of the weak center section racing madly across the beach and thought the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> must have lost their minds. They were so surprised they had no time to mobilize and place their archers, and with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> away the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> had also lost that advantage. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> slammed into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> lines, inflicting severe damages, but the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> struck back, breaking the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> center which then gave way.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> were now confident of victory and pressed on - not knowing this was precisely <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span>' plan. He now ordered the wings of his army to close on the center and crushed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> between them. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> forces fled for their ships and, while some escaped, most were killed and the ships captured. The Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> had been won, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> was saved from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> domination. The Athenians lost 192 men in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> while the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> lost 6,400, according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>. Although <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' numbers have been challenged repeatedly by many historians through the centuries, there is no doubt the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> was a great victory for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> arrived the following day and congratulated the Athenians, but <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> had no time to spare for celebrations. He knew that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> sympathizers were planning on handing <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> over to the enemy and that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> forces would be approaching the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> swiftly. <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> ordered his men to quick march to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, where they were waiting in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> formation when the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet arrived for the attack. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> understood they had been outmaneuvered by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and sailed for home.
<br>
<br>The war had been won, but there was still the matter of those <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> who had sided with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> to betray their country, most notably <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span> and the city-states of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyclades</b></span>, which had gone over to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> side. With <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> now secure, <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> led his army against the islands of <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyclades</b></span> but was defeated. He was wounded in the leg and retired from combat. After the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, his men brought him back to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, where he was charged with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>treason</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Treason</b></span> for his failure and imprisoned. His former service to the Athenians was forgotten in their disappointment at his overwhelming defeat. While in prison, his wound went untreated, and he died from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>gangrene</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gangrene</b></span>. His body was buried in a tomb at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, near those of his men who had fallen in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>. The site was held in honor for years afterwards but eventually was forgotten. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Kelly DeVries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kelly_DeVries</b></span> writes:

<br>If one visited the site of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> only a year before the modern Olympics returned to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> in 2004, one was greeted with a broken monumental <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plinth</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pedestal</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>graffiti</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Graffiti</b></span> spray-painted on all man-made surfaces, and a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>museum</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Museum</b></span> that was rarely visited. The battlefield, on which perhaps the greatest <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ancient Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>'s history had been fought, was not only neglected, it was abused - all except the two <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>grave mounds</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tumulus</b></span> (38).

<br>The site was cleaned up and restored in preparations for the 2500th anniversary of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> in the fall of 2010 and continues to be a popular tourist attraction. The Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> remains one of the most important and often studied/cited of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ancient Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. The unlikely victory of the smaller <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> force and the determination and imagination of their leader has inspired people around the world for centuries. Although <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span>' death in prison was hardly worthy of the great hero of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, later generations recognized his accomplishments and elevated his name to legendary status. Today, his statue stands near the graves of his men on the plains of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> where he defeated the mighty army of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> and saved his country. Ten years later, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> would again invade <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> in 480 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, with an even larger force, and would again be defeated by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, who still remembered the victory at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>
