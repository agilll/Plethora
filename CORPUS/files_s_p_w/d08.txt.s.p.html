Popular culture has been kind to the historical episode of the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a>, but with romanticized anecdotes intertwined between the actual events that took place before and during the particular military encounter. One apt example would <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pertain?lang=en'>pertain</a> to King <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I himself, who was probably closer to the age of 60 at the time of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a>, as opposed to what <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cinema_of_the_United_States?lang=en'>Hollywood</a> would make us believe (by contrast, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes</a> was only 38-years old at the time of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a>). So without further <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/ADO_Den_Haag?lang=en'>ado</a>, let us try to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scale-invariant_feature_transform?lang=en'>sift</a> some of the facts from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fiction?lang=en'>fiction</a>, and have a gander at the 10 things one should know about the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> – a momentous episode of history that stands testament to the importance of tactics and bravery in war.
<br>
<br>While history is not favorable to the ancient <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> when it comes to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> wars, it should be noted that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> had quite a reputable record against the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> in battles prior to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Marathon</a> episode in 490 BC. In that regard, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> were not able to stop the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> juggernaut in the four clashes out of five that took place in open-land during the preceding <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionian_Revolt?lang=en'>Ionian revolt</a>. The fifth clash was a chaotic affair with a night-time ambush on the part of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>.
<br>
<br>But beyond just the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Numbers_game?lang=en'>numbers game</a>, it was the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> combined-arms style of mass combat that allowed them to regularly triumph over the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> armies. To that end, the ‘flexible’ <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> tended to prefer <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archery?lang=en'>archery</a> over solid formations of infantrymen locking their shields. Furthermore, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenids</a> also utilized their <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>cavalry</a> for flanking and even at times as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shock_troops?lang=en'>shock troops</a> to disperse their foes – as evidenced by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/ROH_Final_Battle?lang=en'>final battle</a> of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionian_Revolt?lang=en'>Ionian revolt</a> at Malene that caused the ‘<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> to flee’ due to a last moment <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>cavalry</a> charge (according to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>).
<br>
<br>However the previous encounters were mainly fought by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Greeks?lang=en'>Anatolian Greeks</a>. The ‘mainland’ <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> on the other side not only emphasized hoplite-based warfare but rather took the tactical scope of ‘shoulder-to-shoulder’ combat to a whole new level of organization and discipline. According to much impressed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>, at the commencement of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan army</a> officers grouped the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>hoplites</a> and their lines started moving forward (with some wearing wreaths), while the king began to sing one of many marching-songs composed by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tyrtaeus?lang=en'>Tyrtaios</a>. He was complemented by pipers who played the familiar tune, thus serving as a powerful auditory accompaniment to the progressing <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan army</a>.
<br>
<br>Interestingly, as with many <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> customs, there might have been a practical side underneath this seemingly religious veneer. To that end, the songs and their tunes kept the marching line in order, which entailed a major battlefield tactic – since <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> warfare generally involved closing in with the enemy with a solid, unbroken line. This incredible auditory scope ended in a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dynamics_(music)?lang=en'>crescendo</a> with the collective (yet sacred) war-cry of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paean?lang=en'>paean</a>, a military custom that was <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dorians?lang=en'>Dorian</a> in origin. And finally, if the wreaths and singing didn’t unnerve the enemy, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> also demonstrated their penchant for keeping up their own morale, especially since a massed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>hoplite</a> charge was a chaotic and brutal affair (and thus most other armies broke even before the rigorous impact). As <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xenophon?lang=en'>Xenophon</a>, in spite of being an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athenian</a>, heaped his praise on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> by calling them – “the only true craftsmen in matters of war”.
<br>
<br>And while the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> had their <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>hoplites</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> had their archers – with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bow_and_arrow?lang=en'>bow</a> being the national arm of the ancient Achaemenid <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire?lang=en'>Empire</a>. As a matter of fact, even some of the regular infantrymen, armed with short spears and double-edged daggers, carried their bows and fair share of arrows in a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gorytos?lang=en'>gorytos</a>, a case that housed both the weapon and the projectiles. As for the dedicated <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> archers, they probably carried composite bows that were rather large by contemporary standards. According to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xenophon?lang=en'>Xenophon</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> archers even outranged the Cretans, who were considered as specialists in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archery?lang=en'>archery</a> from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> domain. And beyond just the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bow_and_arrow?lang=en'>bow</a> itself, much of the improved shooting probably had to do with the better <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archery?lang=en'>archery</a> techniques and the lighter arrows preferred by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a>.
<br>
<br>Interestingly enough, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> also had the advantage in their ‘archers’ of a different kind. That is because the gold <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persian_daric?lang=en'>daric</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Money?lang=en'>coin</a> (dareikos in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a>) was popularly referred to as the ‘<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bow_and_arrow?lang=en'>archer</a>’ by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> – since the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Currency?lang=en'>currency</a> depicted the image of a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> royal armed and ready to shoot his <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bow_and_arrow?lang=en'>bow</a>. And thus many of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid</a> Great Kings could boast how he could conquer <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> with his archers, with a possible <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pun?lang=en'>pun</a> in the offering.
<br>
<br>The ancient <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> almost had an obsession with the number ‘thousand’, and as such their regiments were theoretically divided into thousand men known as hazarabam (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hazaras?lang=en'>hazara</a> denoting thousand). The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decimal?lang=en'>decimal system</a> was also upheld when ten such regiments were combined to form a division (baivarabam) of 10,000 men. The so-called ‘<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immortality?lang=en'>Immortals</a>’ or Amrtaka (in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persian_language?lang=en'>Old Persian</a>) were the chosen baivarabam of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> king, and their scope of ‘<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immortality?lang=en'>immortality</a>’ seemingly stemmed from the their constant number – which was always kept at 10,000 (according to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>). In other words, the casualties in this elite division might have been replaced as soon as possible from the best candidates from other <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> baivarabam. As <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> goes on to describe these <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immortals_(Byzantine_Empire)?lang=en'>Athanatoi</a> (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immortality?lang=en'>Immortals</a>) in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> (480 BC) –
<br>
<br>…a body of picked <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> under the leadership of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hydarnes_II?lang=en'>Hydarnes</a>, the son of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hydarnes_II?lang=en'>Hydarnes</a>. This corps was known as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immortality?lang=en'>Immortals</a>, because it was invariably kept up to strength; if a man was killed or fell sick, the vacancy he left was at once filled, so that the total strength of the corps was never less – and never more – than ten thousand.
<br>
<br>Of all the troops in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> army, the native <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> were not only the best but also the most magnificently equipped; their dress and armor I have mentioned already, but I should add that every man glittered with the gold which he carried about his person in unlimited quantity. They were accompanied, moreover, by covered carriages full of their women and servants, all elaborately fitted out. Special food, separate from that of the rest of the army, was brought along for them on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dromedary?lang=en'>dromedaries</a> and mules.
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> historian further mentions their rich attire –
<br>
<br>The dress of these troops consisted of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tiara?lang=en'>tiara</a>, or soft felt <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hat?lang=en'>cap</a>, embroidered <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tunic?lang=en'>tunic</a> with sleeves, a coat of mail looking like the scales of a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fish?lang=en'>fish</a>, and trousers; for arms they carried light wicker shields, quivers slung below them, short spears, powerful bows with cane arrows, and short swords swinging from belts beside the right thigh.
<br>As can be comprehended from such accounts, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immortals_(Achaemenid_Empire)?lang=en'>Persian Immortals</a> were probably very different from the oddly ‘sinister’ manner in which they were depicted in the movie 300. As a matter of fact, such elite divisions tended to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flaunt?lang=en'>flaunt</a> their vibrant and ritzy uniforms and armaments – as is evident from their accounts of carrying spears with golden pomegranates, silver pomegranates and even golden apples. The latter mentioned spears were carried by the king’s own bodyguard unit of 1,000 men – known as arstibara, nicknamed as the ‘Applebearers’.
<br>
<br>The most popular misconception about the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> probably relates to the numbers fielded in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a>. In fact, in many corners of popular culture, the encounter is often depicted as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Thermopylae?lang=en'>300 Spartans</a> (aided by their rag-tag group of allies) versus over a million <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a>. These numbers however are without a shred of doubt exaggerations based on flawed historical accounts, modern-day <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Popular_culture?lang=en'>pop culture</a> sensationalism and of course <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romanticism?lang=en'>romanticism</a>. In fact, during the period (circa 480 BC), <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> alone could have fielded over 8,000 of its free adult citizens as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>hoplites</a>. But historically they could not bring forth their entire army at the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> due to religious observances (like the feast of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo?lang=en'>Apollo</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carnea?lang=en'>Karneia</a>) and the panhellenic <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Olympic_Games?lang=en'>Olympic Games</a>. And while these reasons may seem bizarre to our modern sensibility, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>ancient Greeks</a> formulated strict rules when it came to religious activities – so much so that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> didn’t even aid the Athenians (in time) during the momentous Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Marathon</a>, ten years before <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a>.
<br>
<br>This brings us to the question – how many men did each side have in this incredible encounter? Well interestingly enough, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> – the man who claimed that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> forces numbered over a million troops, clarified how the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> side at least had 5,200 men (as opposed to only <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Thermopylae?lang=en'>300 Spartans</a>). The figure included the over thousand <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Perioeci?lang=en'>perioikoi</a> (the free yet non-citizens of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>), Mantineans, Tegeans, Arcadians, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Corinth?lang=en'>Corinthians</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thespiae?lang=en'>Thespians</a> and even <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thebes,_Greece?lang=en'>Thebans</a> (who probably numbered over 400), along with groups of other Peloponnesians. Modern historians also add the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helots?lang=en'>helots</a> to this array of forces, thus bringing the total number of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> probably over 7,000 men.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Persians?lang=en'>The Persians</a> on the other hand, while undoubtedly having their numerical superiority, would have had logistical constraints to even field half-a-million men, considering the size of their fleet. To that end, modern scholarship suggests that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> could have carried forth around 260,000 men in their 1,300 triremes – but only a percentage of them were actual soldiers, with others serving the duties of oarsmen, baggage carriers and camp followers. To summarize, the plausible figure range for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> army at the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> was somewhere between 80,000 – 100,000 men.
<br>
<br>Another popular misconception (though more valid) about the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> relates to how <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I made his last stand in the encounter. And while this statement holds true for the final day of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a>, the initial decision made by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I and his commanders to hold the pass was probably more of a logical tactic than just a noble warrior’s duty. The very position of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> reveals the ‘<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force_multiplication?lang=en'>force-multiplier</a>’ strategy of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>, with the defensive area being only around 15 m (or 49 ft) in width, and governing a location that was nearby to a smaller <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mountain_warfare?lang=en'>mountain</a> passage on its left and sea to its right.
<br>
<br>In fact, part of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I’ strategy to defend his position at what is known as the ‘Middle Gate’ was fueled by the presence of an existing (though dilapidated) wall that was built by the local Phokians. And while the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> forces were busy repairing the makeshift fortification, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I also took heed of many of the flanking routes that bypassed the gates. One of these treacherous pathways, known as the Anopaia path, was actually guarded by around 1,000 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phocis_(ancient_region)?lang=en'>Phokian</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>hoplites</a> under the directive of the Spartan king.
<br>
<br>It is no hidden secret that the sheer level of training and high morale of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> allowed to them to be steadfast in the face of an overwhelming <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> force in the first day of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a>. The encounter didn’t prove be successful for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes</a>, with the heavy defeat rather exacerbated by the constricted landscape of the pass (which countered the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> advantage in numbers). And <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, while being vague on casualty figures, talked about how the longer spears of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> were actually better suited to the task of engaging the enemy than the shorter spears of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> infantrymen. We are also told that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> fought in relays, with contingents allowed to take break from the front-line – thus making the defense more effective with fresher batches of men.
<br>
<br>However, while much has been said about Spartan ‘obstinacy’ in the face of imminent danger, one should also understand that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> among most <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> comprehended the practicality of warfare. In many ways, their army was the closest to what can be termed as a professional military force in the contemporary ancient world. To that end, an often overlooked ploy in the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> related to how the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> not only held their positions, but also made organized retreats, to lure the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> into tighter terrains. And once a large enemy force was cut off from the main body, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> turned around and used their superior melee skills (along with the element of surprise) to destroy them in a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piecemeal_(Gilbert_Benson)?lang=en'>piecemeal</a> fashion. This tactic of feigning retreats also didn’t allow the famed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> archers to focus on stationary targets of massed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>hoplites</a>.
<br>
<br>The second day of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> also played out in a similar fashion like its previous day, with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> unable to make any significant breakthrough. But then came the famous episode of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephialtes_of_Trachis?lang=en'>Ephialtes</a> and how he presented himself before the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> command as a guide for the ‘secret’ path that would bypass the main <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> position and catch them unawares at the rear. But as we fleetingly mentioned before, once again contrary to popular notions, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I was already aware of the existence of such a path. In fact, this very passage, known as the Anopaia path, was actually guarded by the local <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phocis_(ancient_region)?lang=en'>Phokian</a> contingent that had around a thousand men.
<br>
<br>But unfortunately for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> sent their elite <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immortality?lang=en'>Immortals</a> (presumably guided by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephialtes_of_Trachis?lang=en'>Ephialtes</a>), who probably set out in their full numbers to make a deciding impact in the conflict. And by the dawn of the third day, they reached the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phocis_(ancient_region)?lang=en'>Phokian</a> positions, with both sides rather surprised by each others presence. And while the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phocis_(ancient_region)?lang=en'>Phokian</a> citizen-militia were known for their competent vigilance over the local lands (at least under <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> control), they were simply no match for the ‘mixed-tactics’ espoused by the heavily-trained <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immortality?lang=en'>Immortals</a>. In the following encounter, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immortality?lang=en'>Immortals</a> quickly overwhelmed their opponents by focused arrow-fire volleys. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phocis_(ancient_region)?lang=en'>Phokian</a> militias rapidly retreated to the higher grounds, and then most of them pleaded for their lives to the arriving <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> forces. Interestingly enough, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immortality?lang=en'>Immortals</a>, instead of dallying with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phocis_(ancient_region)?lang=en'>Phokian</a> forces, continued their calculated advance into the rear part of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> positions, thus ultimately turning the tide of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a>.
<br>
<br>After <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I heard the news of their vulnerable position in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a>, he once again resorted to a tactical decision that ironically entailed making a last stand. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/In_Essence?lang=en'>In essence</a>, while later tales extolled the virtues of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Defiance_(TV_series)?lang=en'>defiance</a> and braveness in the face of imminent death (and justifiably so), <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I and his men stayed behind not for their posthumous praises, but for covering a significant part of the army that had over 5,000 men. To that end, when it comes to strategy, the overall retreat of the entire <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> army, while being one of the available options, wouldn’t have been the best course of action since <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>cavalry</a> by this time could have easily overtaken them and cut them off in a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piecemeal_(Gilbert_Benson)?lang=en'>piecemeal</a> manner.
<br>
<br>Simply put, to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I, it was the matter of saving a significant part of the defending force by rear-guard action or making a prolonged last stand with the entire army that would have caused greater number of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> casualties. Suffice it to say, he bravely (and wisely) chose the former. And this allowed the majority of the defending <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> soldiers to escape from the clutches of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes</a> at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a>.
<br>
<br>But once again, as opposed to popular notions, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I did not make his last stand with just his <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Thermopylae?lang=en'>300 Spartans</a>. They were probably aided by their <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helots?lang=en'>helot</a> attendants (possibly numbering over 300), along with around 700 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thespiae?lang=en'>Thespians</a> and 400 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thebes,_Greece?lang=en'>Thebans</a> (who, according to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> were held against their will, though practicality of warfare suggests otherwise). And instead of occupying the narrow pass, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I ordered his assembled rear-guard to advance to a broader area, knowing well that their previously guarded position was now vulnerable to the approaching <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immortality?lang=en'>Immortals</a> from behind. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> army of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>hoplites</a> made their characteristic slow advance with shield-walls, singing of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paean?lang=en'>paean</a> hymns and ritual sacrifices.
<br>
<br>Interestingly enough, the orthodox method of marching was soon done with, as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> arrows began to fall among the ranks. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I comprehending the urgency of the situation, ordered his men to sprint along the last few yards and quickly close the gap between the enemy and themselves, thus once again denying the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> archers to have a go at relatively immobile targets. And once the armies met, a furious clash ensued, which resulted in even greater <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> casualties (according to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>). But unfortunately for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> I met his demise in the chaotic melee engagement, and his guards valiantly defended the fallen body of their king to the last man. Finally the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> decided to fall back to the narrow pass, and made their stand on a hillock (with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Broken_Spears?lang=en'>broken spears</a> and swords), though the remaining <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thebes,_Greece?lang=en'>Thebans</a> possibly endeavored to surrender themselves and their weapons to the enemy. Thus ended the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a>, resulting in a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pyrrhic_victory?lang=en'>Pyrrhic victory</a> for the invading <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a>.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/In_Essence?lang=en'>In essence</a>, the last stand was not just about the heroics of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Thermopylae?lang=en'>300 Spartans</a>, but rather encompassed the gutsy feat of over a thousand <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> that included both free-men <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>hoplites</a> and lightly armed slaves. In fact, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> even grudgingly mentioned the corpses of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helots?lang=en'>helots</a>
