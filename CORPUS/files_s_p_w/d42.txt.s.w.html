<span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> (/hɪˈrɒdətəs/; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ancient Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>: Ἡρόδοτος, Hêródotos, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Attic Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Attic_Greek</b></span> pronunciation: [hɛː.ró.do.tos]) was a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historian who was born in Halicarnassus in the Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> (modern-day <span style='color: blue'><b>Bodrum</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Turkey</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ottoman_Empire</b></span>) and lived in the fifth century BC (c. 484–c. 425 BC), a contemporary of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Socrates</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Euripides</b></span>. He is often referred to as "The Father of History", a title first conferred by <span style='color: blue'><b>Cicero</b></span>;[1] he was the first historian known to have broken from Homeric tradition to treat historical subjects as a method of investigation—specifically, by collecting his materials systematically and critically, and then arranging them into a historiographic narrative.[2]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span> is the only work which he is known to have produced, a record of his "inquiry" (ἱστορία historía) on the origins of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>; it primarily deals with the lives of <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Smerdis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bardiya</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> and the battles of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Plataea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Plataea</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>; however, its many cultural, ethnographical, geographical, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>historiographical</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Historiography</b></span>, and other digressions form a defining and essential part of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span> and contain a wealth of information. Some of his stories are fanciful and others inaccurate, yet he states that he is reporting only what he was told; a sizable portion of the information he provided was later confirmed by historians and archaeologists.
<br>
<br>Despite <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s historical significance, little is known of his personal life.
<br>
<br>Here are presented the results of the enquiry carried out by <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> of Halicarnassus. The purpose is to prevent the traces of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>human events</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Human_Events</b></span> from being erased by time, and to preserve the fame of the important and remarkable achievements produced by both <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and non-Greeks; among the matters covered is, in particular, the cause of the hostilities between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and non-Greeks.
<br>
<br>His record of the achievements of others was an achievement in itself, though the extent of it has been debated. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s place in history and his significance may be understood according to the traditions within which he worked. His work is the earliest <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> prose to have survived intact. However, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dionysius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus</b></span>, a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>literary critic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Literary_criticism</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Augustan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Augustus</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Rome</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Rome</b></span>, listed seven predecessors of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, describing their works as simple, unadorned accounts of their own and other cities and people, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> or foreign, including popular legends, sometimes melodramatic and naïve, often charming – all traits that can be found in the work of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> himself.[4]
<br>
<br>Modern historians regard the chronology as uncertain, but according to the ancient account, these predecessors included <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dionysius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Charon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Yugoloth</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lampsacus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellanicus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hellanicus_of_Lesbos</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lesbos</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xanthus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xanthos</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span> and, the best attested of them all, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hecataeus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hecataeus_of_Miletus</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>. Of these, only fragments of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hecataeus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hecataeus_of_Miletus</b></span>'s works survived, and the authenticity of these is debatable,[5] but they provide a glimpse into the kind of tradition within which <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> wrote his own <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hecataeus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hecataeus_of_Miletus</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> speaks thus: I write these things as they seem true to me; for the stories told by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> are various and in my opinion absurd.
<br>
<br>This points forward to the "folksy" yet "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>international</span> <span style='color: green'><b>International_law</b></span>" outlook typical of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>. However, one modern scholar has described the work of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hecataeus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hecataeus_of_Miletus</b></span> as "a curious <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>false start</span> <span style='color: green'><b>False_start</b></span> to history",[6] since despite his critical spirit, he failed to liberate history from myth. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> mentions <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hecataeus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hecataeus_of_Miletus</b></span> in his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, on one occasion mocking him for his naive <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>genealogy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Genealogy</b></span> and, on another occasion, quoting <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> complaints against his handling of their national history.[7] It is possible that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> borrowed much material from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hecataeus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hecataeus_of_Miletus</b></span>, as stated by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Porphyry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Porphyry_of_Gaza</b></span> in a quote recorded by <span style='color: blue'><b>Eusebius</b></span>.[8] In particular, it is possible that he copied descriptions of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>crocodile</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Crocodile</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hippopotamus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hippopotamus</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phoenix</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Fenghuang</b></span> from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hecataeus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hecataeus_of_Miletus</b></span>'s <span style='color: blue'><b>Circumnavigation</b></span> of the Known World (Periegesis / Periodos ges), even misrepresenting the source as "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Heliopolitans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gods_(Marvel_Comics)</b></span>" (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span> 2.73).[9]
<br>
<br>But <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hecataeus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hecataeus_of_Miletus</b></span> did not record events that had occurred in living <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>memory</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Memory</b></span>, unlike <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, nor did he include the oral traditions of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> history within the larger framework of oriental history.[10] There is no proof that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> derived the ambitious scope of his own work, with its grand theme of civilizations in conflict, from any predecessor, despite much scholarly speculation about this in modern times.[6][11] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> claims to be better informed than his predecessors by relying on empirical observation to correct their excessive schematism. For example, he argues for continental asymmetry as opposed to the older theory of a perfectly circular earth with <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>/<span style='color: blue'><b>Africa</b></span> equal in size (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span> 4.36 and 4.42). However, he retains idealizing tendencies, as in his symmetrical notions of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Danube</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Nile</b></span>.[12]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>His debt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>His_Debt</b></span> to previous authors of prose "histories" might be questionable, but there is no doubt that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> owed much to the example and inspiration of poets and story-tellers. For example, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> tragic poets provided him with a world-view of a balance between conflicting forces, upset by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hubris</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hubris</b></span> of kings, and they provided his narrative with a model of episodic structure. His familiarity with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> tragedy is demonstrated in a number of passages echoing <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeschylus</b></span>'s <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span>, including the epigrammatic observation that the defeat of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> navy at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> caused the defeat of the land army (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span> 8.68 ~ <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> 728). <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The debt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Debt_(2010_film)</b></span> may have been repaid by <span style='color: blue'><b>Sophocles</b></span> because there appear to be echoes of The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span> in his plays, especially a passage in <span style='color: blue'><b>Antigone</b></span> that resembles <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s account of the death of Intaphernes (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span> 3.119 ~ <span style='color: blue'><b>Antigone</b></span> 904-920).[13] However, this point is one of the most contentious issues in modern scholarship.[14]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Homer</b></span> was another inspirational source.[b] Just as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Homer drew</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Homer_Drew</b></span> extensively on a tradition of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oral poetry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Oral_literature</b></span>, sung by wandering minstrels, so <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> appears to have drawn on an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> tradition of story-telling, collecting and interpreting the oral histories he chanced upon in his travels. These oral histories often contained folk-tale motifs and demonstrated a moral, yet they also contained substantial facts relating to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>geography</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Geography</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>anthropology</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anthropology</b></span>, and history, all compiled by <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> in an entertaining style and format.[16]
<br>
<br>It is on account of the many strange stories and the folk-tales he reported that his critics in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>early modern</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Early_modern_period</b></span> times branded him "The Father of Lies".[17][18] Even his own contemporaries found reason to scoff at his achievement. In fact, one modern scholar[19] has wondered if <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> left his home in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Anatolia</b></span>, migrating westwards to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and beyond, because his own countrymen had ridiculed his work, a circumstance possibly hinted at in an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>epitaph</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Epitaph</b></span> said to have been dedicated to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> at one of his three supposed resting places, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thuria</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thurian_Age</b></span>:
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> the son of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sphynx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sphinx</b></span> 
<br>lies; in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> history without peer; 
<br>a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dorian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dorians</b></span> born, who fled from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>slander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Defamation</b></span>'s brand 
<br>and made in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thuria</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thurian_Age</b></span> his new native land.[20]
<br>
<br>Yet it was in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> where his most <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>formidable</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Formidable-class_frigate</b></span> contemporary critics could be found. In 425 BC, which is about the time that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> is thought by many scholars to have died, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> comic <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dramatist</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Theatre_of_ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristophanes</b></span> created <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Acharnians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Acharnians</b></span>, in which he blames the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> on the abduction of some prostitutes – a mocking reference to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, who reported the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>' account of their wars with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, beginning with the rapes of the mythical heroines <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Io</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_locations_in_Babylon_5</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Europa</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Europa_F.C.</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Medea</b></span>, and Helen.[21][22]
<br>
<br>Similarly, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> dismissed <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> as a "logos-writer" (story-teller).[23] <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>, who had been trained in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>rhetoric</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Rhetoric</b></span>, became the model for subsequent prose-writers as an author who seeks to appear firmly in control of his material, whereas with his frequent digressions <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> appeared to minimize (or possibly disguise) his authorial control.[24] Moreover, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> developed a historical topic more in keeping with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> world-view: focused on the context of the polis or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city-state</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Polis</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>interplay</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Interplay_Entertainment</b></span> of civilizations was more relevant to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> living in <span style='color: blue'><b>Anatolia</b></span>, such as <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> himself, for whom life within a foreign civilization was a recent <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>memory</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Memory</b></span>.[23]
<br>
<br>Before the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> crisis, history had been represented among the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> only by local or family traditions. The "Wars of Liberation" had given to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> the first genuinely historical inspiration felt by a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. These wars showed him that there was a corporate life, higher than that of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>, of which the story might be told; and they offered to him as a subject the drama of the collision between East and West. With him, the spirit of history was born into <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>; and his work, called after the nine <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Muses</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Muse</b></span>, was indeed the first utterance of <span style='color: blue'><b>Clio</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Relief of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Jean-Guillaume Moitte</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Jean_Guillaume_Moitte</b></span> (1806), <span style='color: blue'><b>Louvre</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Paris</b></span>
<br>Modern scholars generally turn to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s own writing for reliable information about his life,[26] supplemented with ancient yet much later sources, such as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Byzantine</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Byzantium</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Suda</b></span>, an 11th century <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>encyclopaedia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Encyclopedia</b></span> which possibly took its information from traditional accounts.
<br>
<br>The data are so few – they rest upon such late and slight authority; they are so improbable or so contradictory, that to compile them into a biography is like building a house of cards, which the first breath of criticism will blow to the ground. Still, certain points may be approximately fixed ...
<br>
<br>Modern accounts of his life typically[28][29] go something like this: <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> was born at Halicarnassus around 484 BC. There is no reason to disbelieve the <span style='color: blue'><b>Suda</b></span>'s information about his family: that it was influential and that he was the son of Lyxes and Dryo, and the brother of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Theodorus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Theodore_of_Mopsuestia</b></span>, and that he was also related to <span style='color: blue'><b>Panyassis</b></span> – an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>epic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Epic_poetry</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>poet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Poetry</b></span> of the time. The town was within the Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> at that time, making <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> subject,[30][31] and it may be that the young <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> heard local eye-witness accounts of events within the empire and of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> preparations for the invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, including the movements of the local fleet under the command of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artemisia_I_of_Caria</b></span> I of <span style='color: blue'><b>Caria</b></span>. Inscriptions recently discovered at Halicarnassus indicate that her grandson <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lygdamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tugdamme</b></span> negotiated with a local assembly to settle disputes over seized property, which is consistent with a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> under pressure. His name is not mentioned later in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tribute list</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tribute</b></span> of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>, indicating that there might well have been a successful uprising against him some time before 454 BC. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>epic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Epic_poetry</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>poet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Poetry</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Panyassis</b></span> – a relative of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> – is reported to have taken part in a failed uprising. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> expresses affection for the island of <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span> (III, 39–60), and this is an indication that he might have lived there in his youth. So it is possible that his family was involved in an uprising against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lygdamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tugdamme</b></span>, leading to a period of exile on <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span> and followed by some personal hand in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span>'s eventual fall.

<br>The statue of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> in his hometown of Halicarnassus, modern <span style='color: blue'><b>Bodrum</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Turkey</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ottoman_Empire</b></span>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> wrote his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span> in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dialect</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dialect</b></span>, yet he was born in Halicarnassus, which was a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dorian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dorians</b></span> settlement. According to the <span style='color: blue'><b>Suda</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> learned the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dialect</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dialect</b></span> as a boy living on the island of <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span>, to which he had fled with his family from the oppressions of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lygdamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tugdamme</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> of Halicarnassus and grandson of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artemisia_I_of_Caria</b></span> I. The <span style='color: blue'><b>Suda</b></span> also <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>informs</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Institute_for_Operations_Research_and_the_Management_Sciences</b></span> us that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> later returned home to lead the revolt that eventually overthrew the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span>. Due to recent discoveries of inscriptions at Halicarnassus dated to about <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s time, we now know that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionic dialect</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionic_Greek</b></span> was used in Halicarnassus in some official documents, so there is no need to assume (like the <span style='color: blue'><b>Suda</b></span>) that he must have learned the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dialect</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dialect</b></span> elsewhere.[32] Further, the <span style='color: blue'><b>Suda</b></span> is the only source which we have for the role played by <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> as the heroic liberator of his birthplace. That itself is a good reason to doubt such a romantic account.[33]
<br>
<br>As <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> himself reveals, Halicarnassus, though a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dorian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dorians</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>, had ended its <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>close relations</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Close_Relations</b></span> with its <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dorian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dorians</b></span> neighbours after an unseemly quarrel (I, 144), and it had helped pioneer <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> trade with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> (II, 178). It was, therefore, an outward-looking, international-minded port within the Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span>, and the historian's family could well have had contacts in other countries under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule, facilitating his travels and his researches.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s eye-witness accounts indicate that he traveled in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> in association with Athenians, probably some time after 454 BC or possibly earlier, after an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> fleet had assisted the uprising against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule in 460–454 BC. He probably traveled to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tyre</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tire</b></span> next and then down the <span style='color: blue'><b>Euphrates</b></span> to <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span>. For some reason, possibly associated with local politics, he subsequently found himself unpopular in Halicarnassus, and some time around 447 BC, migrated to Periclean <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> – a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> whose people and democratic institutions he openly admires (V, 78). <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> was also the place where he came to know the local topography (VI, 137; VIII, 52–5), as well as leading citizens such as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alcmaeonids</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alcmaeonidae</b></span>, a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>clan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Clan</b></span> whose history features frequently in his writing.
<br>
<br>According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Eusebius</b></span>[34] and <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>,[35] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> was granted a financial reward by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian assembly</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span> in recognition of his work. It is possible that he unsuccessfully applied for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> citizenship, a rare honour after 451 BC, requiring two separate votes by a well-attended assembly.
<br>
<br>In 443 BC or shortly afterwards, he migrated to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thurium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thurii</b></span> as part of an Athenian-sponsored <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>colony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Colonies_in_antiquity</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristotle</b></span> refers to a version of The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span> written by "<span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thurium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thurii</b></span>", and some passages in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span> have been interpreted as proof that he wrote about southern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Italy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Italy</b></span> from personal experience there (IV, 15,99; VI, 127). Intimate knowledge of some events in the first years of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> (VI, 91; VII, 133, 233; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>IX</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Final_Fantasy_IX</b></span>, 73) indicate that he might have returned to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, in which case it is possible that he died there during an outbreak of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plague</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bubonic_plague</b></span>. Possibly he died in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedonia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Republic_of_Macedonia</b></span> instead, after obtaining the patronage of the court there; or else he died back in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thurium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thurii</b></span>. There is nothing in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span> that can be dated to later than 430 BC with any certainty, and it is generally assumed that he died not long afterwards, possibly before his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sixtieth</span> <span style='color: green'><b>60th_United_States_Congress</b></span> year.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> would have made his researches known to the larger world through oral recitations to a public crowd. John Marincola writes in his introduction to the Penguin edition of The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span> that there are certain identifiable pieces in the early books of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s work which could be labeled as "performance pieces". These portions of the research seem independent and "almost detachable", so that they might have been set aside by the author for the purposes of an oral performance. The intellectual <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>matrix</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Composite_material</b></span> of the 5th century, Marincola suggests, comprised many oral performances in which philosophers would dramatically recite such detachable pieces of their work. The idea was to criticize previous arguments on a topic and emphatically and enthusiastically insert their own in order to win over the audience.[36]
<br>
<br>It was conventional in <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s day for authors to "publish" their works by reciting them at popular festivals. According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Lucian</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> took his finished work straight from <span style='color: blue'><b>Anatolia</b></span> to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympic Games</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Olympic_Games</b></span> and read the entire <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span> to the assembled spectators in one sitting, receiving rapturous applause at the end of it.[37] According to a very different account by an ancient <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>grammarian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Grammar</b></span>,[38] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> refused to begin reading his work at the festival of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Opel_Olympia</b></span> until some clouds offered him a bit of shade – by which time the assembly had dispersed. (Hence the proverbial <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>expression</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Idiom</b></span> "<span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> and his shade" to describe someone who misses an opportunity through delay.) <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s recitation at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Opel_Olympia</b></span> was a favourite theme among ancient writers, and there is another interesting variation on the story to be found in the <span style='color: blue'><b>Suda</b></span>: that of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Photius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Photios_I_of_Constantinople</b></span>[39] and Tzetzes,[40] in which a young <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> happened to be in the assembly with his father, and burst into tears during the recital. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> observed prophetically to the boy's father, "Your son's <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>soul</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Soul</b></span> yearns for knowledge."
<br>
<br>Eventually, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> became close enough for both to be interred in <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>' tomb in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>. Such at least was the opinion of Marcellinus in his Life of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>.[41] According to the <span style='color: blue'><b>Suda</b></span>, he was buried in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Macedonians</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Pella</b></span> and in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>agora</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Agora</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thurium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thurii</b></span>.[42]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span> were occasionally criticized in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>antiquity</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>,[c] but modern historians and philosophers generally take a positive view.[43] Despite the controversy,[44][d] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> still serves as the primary, and often only, source for events in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> world, Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span>, and the region generally in the two centuries leading up until his own day.[17][46] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, like many ancient historians, preferred an element of show[e] to purely analytic history, aiming to give pleasure with "exciting events, great dramas, bizarre <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>exotica</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Exotica</b></span>."[48] As such, certain passages[49][50] have been the subject of controversy and even some doubt, both in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>antiquity</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and today.[51][52][53][54][55][56][57][f]
<br>
<br>The accuracy of the works of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> has been controversial since his own era.[g] <span style='color: blue'><b>Cicero</b></span>[h][59] <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristotle</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Josephus</b></span>, Duris of <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span>,[i][60] <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpocration</b></span>[j][61] and <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> all commented on this controversy.[62][63] Generally, however, he was regarded as reliable in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>antiquity</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, and is especially so today. Many scholars, ancient and modern, routinely cite <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> (e.g., <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aubin</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aubin_Codex</b></span>, A. H. L. Heeren, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Davidson</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alan_Davidson_(cricketer,_born_1929)</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cheikh</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sheikh</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Anta</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tapir</b></span> Diop, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Poe</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Edgar_Allan_Poe</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Welsby</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Welsby,_Queensland</b></span>, Celenko, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Volney</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Constantin_François_de_Chassebœuf,_comte_de_Volney</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pierre Montet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pierre_Montet</b></span>, Bernal, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Jackson</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Jackson_Guitars</b></span>, DuBois, <span style='color: blue'><b>Strabo</b></span>). Many of these scholars (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Welsby</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Welsby,_Queensland</b></span>, Heeren, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aubin</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aubin_Codex</b></span>, Diop, etc.) explicitly mention the reliability of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s work[k] and demonstrate corroboration of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s writings by modern scholars.[l][64] A. H. L. Heeren quoted <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> throughout his work and provided corroboration by scholars regarding several passages (source of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Nile</b></span>, location of Meroe, etc.).[65] To further his work on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyrians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Assyria</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aubin</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aubin_Codex</b></span> uses <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s accounts in various passages and defends <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s position. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aubin</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aubin_Codex</b></span> said that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> was "the author of the first important narrative history of the world".[66] Diop provides several examples (the inundations of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Nile</b></span>) which, he argues, support his view that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> was "quite scrupulous, objective, scientific for his time." Diop argues that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> "always distinguishes carefully between what he has seen and what he has been told." Diop also notes that <span style='color: blue'><b>Strabo</b></span> corroborated <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s ideas about the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Black</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Black_Sea</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span>, Ethiopians, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Colchians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Colchis</b></span>.[67][68]
<br>
<br>The reliability of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' writing about <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> is sometimes criticized.[57][m] Alan B. Lloyd argues that, as a historical document, the writings of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> are seriously defective, and that he was working from "inadequate sources".[51] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Nielsen</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nielsen_ratings</b></span> writes: "Though we cannot entirely rule out the possibility of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> having been in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span>, it must be said that his narrative bears little witness to it."[52] German historian Detlev Fehling questions whether <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> ever traveled up the <span style='color: blue'><b>Nile</b></span> River, and considers doubtful almost everything that he says about <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ethiopia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aethiopia</b></span>.[69][53] Fehling states that "there is not the slightest bit of history behind the whole story" about the claim of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> that <span style='color: blue'><b>Pharaoh</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Sesostris</b></span> campaigned in <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>, and that he left a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>colony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Colonies_in_antiquity</b></span> in Colchia.[55][54][n]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> provides much information about the nature of the world and the status of science during his lifetime, often engaging in private speculation. For example, he reports that the annual flooding of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Nile</b></span> was said to be the result of melting snows far to the south, and he comments that he cannot understand how there can be <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>snow</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Snow</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Africa</b></span>, the hottest part of the known world, offering an elaborate explanation based on the way that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>desert winds</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Desert_Winds</b></span> affect the passage of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sun</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ra</b></span> over this part of the world (2:18ff). He also passes on reports from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenician</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span> sailors that, while circumnavigating <span style='color: blue'><b>Africa</b></span>, they "saw the sun on the right side while sailing westwards". Owing to this brief mention, which is included almost as an afterthought, it has been argued that <span style='color: blue'><b>Africa</b></span> was circumnavigated by ancient seafarers, for this is precisely where the sun ought to have been. His accounts of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>India</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_India</b></span> are among the oldest records of Indian civilization by an outsider.[70][71][72]
<br>
<br>Discoveries made since the end of the 19th century have generally added to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s credibility. He described <span style='color: blue'><b>Gelonus</b></span>, located in <span style='color: blue'><b>Scythia</b></span>, as a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> thousands of times larger than <span style='color: blue'><b>Troy</b></span>; this was widely disbelieved until it was rediscovered in 1975. The archaeological study of the now-submerged ancient <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Heracleion</b></span> and the recovery of the so-called "<span style='color: blue'><b>Naucratis</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>stela</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Stele</b></span>" give credibility to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s previously unsupported claim that <span style='color: blue'><b>Heracleion</b></span> was founded during the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>New Kingdom</span> <span style='color: green'><b>New_Kingdom_of_Egypt</b></span>.
<br>
<br>After journeys to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>India</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_India</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Pakistan</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>French</span> <span style='color: green'><b>French_language</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ethnologist</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ethnology</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Michel Peissel</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Michel_Peissel</b></span> claimed to have discovered an animal <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>species</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Species</b></span> that may illuminate one of the most bizarre passages in <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span>.[73] In Book 3, passages 102 to 105, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> reports that a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>species</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Species</b></span> of fox-sized, furry "ants" lives in one of the far eastern, Indian provinces of the Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span>. This region, he reports, is a sandy desert, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sand</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sand</b></span> there contains a wealth of fine gold dust. These giant ants, according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, would often <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>unearth</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Unearth</b></span> the gold dust when digging their mounds and tunnels, and the people living in this province would then collect the precious dust. Peissel reports that, in an isolated region of northern <span style='color: blue'><b>Pakistan</b></span> on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Deosai Plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Deosai_National_Park</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Gilgit–Baltistan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gilgit-Baltistan</b></span> province, there is a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>species</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Species</b></span> of marmot – the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Himalayan marmot</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Himalayan_marmot</b></span>, a type of burrowing squirrel – that may have been what <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> called giant ants. The ground of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Deosai Plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Deosai_National_Park</b></span> is rich in gold dust, much like the province that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> describes. According to Peissel, he interviewed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Minaro</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Brokpa</b></span> tribal people who live in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Deosai Plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Deosai_National_Park</b></span>, and they have confirmed that they have, for generations, been collecting the gold dust that the marmots bring to the surface when they are digging their underground burrows. Later authors such as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pliny</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pliny_the_Elder</b></span> mentioned this story in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>gold mining</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gold_mining</b></span> section of his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Naturalis Historia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Natural_History_(Pliny)</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Peissel offers the theory that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> may have confused the old <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> word for "marmot" with the word for "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mountain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mountain</b></span> ant". Research suggests that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> probably did not know any <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> (or any other language except his native <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>) and was forced to rely on many local translators when travelling in the vast multilingual Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> did not claim to have personally seen the creatures which he described.[73][74] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> did, though, follow up in passage 105 of Book 3 with the claim that the "ants" are said to chase and devour full-grown camels.
<br>
<br>Some "calumnious fictions" were written about <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> in a work titled On the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Malice</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Cure</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> by <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>, a Chaeronean by birth, (or it might have been a <span style='color: blue'><b>Pseudo-Plutarch</b></span>, in this case "a great collector of slanders"), including the allegation that the historian was prejudiced against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia</b></span> because the authorities there had denied him permission to set up a school.[75] Similarly, in a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corinth</b></span> Oration, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dio Chrysostom</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dio_Chrysostom</b></span> (or yet another pseudonymous author) accused the historian of prejudice against <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span>, sourcing it in personal bitterness over financial disappointments[76] – an account also given by Marcellinus in his Life of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>.[77] In fact, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> was in the habit of seeking out information from empowered sources within communities, such as aristocrats and priests, and this also occurred at an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>international</span> <span style='color: green'><b>International_law</b></span> level, with Periclean <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> becoming his principal source of information about events in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. As a result, his reports about <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> events are often coloured by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> bias against rival states – <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> in particular.[78]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span> were sometimes criticized in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>antiquity</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>,[o] but modern historians and philosophers take a more positive view of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s methodology, especially those searching for a paradigm of objective historical writing. A few modern scholars have argued that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> exaggerated the extent of his travels and invented his sources,[79] yet his reputation continues largely intact. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> is variously considered "father of comparative <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>anthropology</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anthropology</b></span>",[17] "the father of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ethnography</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ethnography</b></span>",[46] and "more modern than any other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ancient historian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_history</b></span> in his approach to the ideal of total history".[43]
<br>
<br>It is clear from the beginning of Book 1 of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span> that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> utilizes (or at least claims to utilize) various sources in his narrative. K.H. Waters relates that "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Herodotos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span> did not work from a purely <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> standpoint; he was accused by the patriotic but somewhat imperceptive <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> of being philobarbaros, a pro-barbarian or pro-foreigner."[80]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> at times relates various accounts of the same story. For example, in Book 1 he mentions both the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenician</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> accounts of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Io</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_locations_in_Babylon_5</b></span>.[81] However, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> at times arbitrates between varying accounts: "I am not going to say that these events happened one way or the other. Rather, I will point out the man who I know for a fact began the wrong-doing against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>."[82] Again, later, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> claims himself as an authority: "I know this is how it happened because I heard it from the Delphians myself."[83]
<br>
<br>Throughout his work, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> attempts to explain the actions of people. Speaking about <span style='color: blue'><b>Solon</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> states "[<span style='color: blue'><b>Solon</b></span>] sailed away on the pretext of seeing the world, but it was really so that he could not be compelled to repeal any of the laws he had laid down."[84] Again, in the story about <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span> and his son's death, when speaking of <span style='color: blue'><b>Adrastus</b></span> (the man who accidentally killed <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span>' son), <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> states: "<span style='color: blue'><b>Adrastus</b></span> ... believing himself to be the most ill-fated man he had ever known, cut his own throat over the grave."[85]
<br>
<br>While <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> had not met these people whom he is discussing, he claims to understand their thoughts and intentions.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> writes with the purpose of explaining; that is, he discusses the reason for or cause of for an event. He lays this out in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>proem</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Preface</b></span>: "This is the publication of the research of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> of Halicarnassus, so that the actions of people shall not fade with time, so that the great and admirable achievements of both <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and barbarians shall not go unrenowned, and, among other things, to set forth the reasons why they waged war on each other."[86]
<br>
<br>This mode of explanation traces itself all the way back to <span style='color: blue'><b>Homer</b></span>,[87] who opened the <span style='color: blue'><b>Iliad</b></span> by asking:
<br>
<br>Which of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>immortals set</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dungeons_&_Dragons_Immortals_Rules</b></span> these two at each other's throats?
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Apollo</b></span>,
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Zeus</b></span>’ son and <span style='color: blue'><b>Leto</b></span>’s, offended
<br>by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>warlord</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Warlord</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></span> had dishonored
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Chryses</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Apollo</b></span>'s <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>priest</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Clergy</b></span>, so the god
<br>struck the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek camp</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_Jupiter_trojans_(Greek_camp)</b></span> with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plague</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bubonic_plague</b></span>,
<br>and the soldiers were dying of it.[88]
<br>Both <span style='color: blue'><b>Homer</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> begin with a question of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>causality</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Causality</b></span>. In <span style='color: blue'><b>Homer</b></span>'s case, "who set these two at each other's throats?" In <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s case, "Why did the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and barbarians go to war with each other?"
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s means of explanation does not necessarily posit a simple cause; rather, his explanations cover a host of potential causes and emotions. It is notable, however, that "the obligations of gratitude and revenge are the fundamental human motives for <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, just as ... they are the primary stimulus to the generation of narrative itself."<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>[89</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Effects_of_Hurricane_Sandy_in_New_York</b></span>]
<br>
<br>Some readers of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> believe that his habit of tying events back to personal motives signifies an inability to see broader and more abstract reasons for action. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Gould</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Stephen_Jay_Gould</b></span> argues to the contrary that this is likely because <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> attempts to provide the rational reasons, as understood by his contemporaries, rather than providing more abstract reasons.[90]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> attributes cause to both divine and human agents. These are not perceived as mutually exclusive, but rather mutually interconnected. This is true of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> thinking in general, at least from <span style='color: blue'><b>Homer</b></span> onward.[91] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Gould</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Stephen_Jay_Gould</b></span> notes that invoking the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>supernatural</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Supernatural</b></span> in order to explain an event does not answer the question "why did this happen?" but rather "why did this happen to me?" By way of example, faulty craftsmanship is the human cause for a house collapsing. However, divine will is the reason that the house collapses at the particular moment when I am inside. It was the will of the gods that the house collapsed while a particular individual was within it, whereas it was the cause of man that the house had a weak structure and was prone to falling.[92]
<br>
<br>Some authors, including Geoffrey de Ste-Croix and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mabel Lang</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mabel_Lang</b></span>, have argued that Fate, or the belief that "this is how it had to be," is <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s ultimate understanding of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>causality</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Causality</b></span>.[93] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s explanation that an event "was going to happen" maps well on to Aristotelean and Homeric means of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>expression</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Idiom</b></span>. The idea of "it was going to happen" reveals a "tragic discovery" associated with fifth-century drama. This tragic discovery can be seen in <span style='color: blue'><b>Homer</b></span>'s, <span style='color: blue'><b>Iliad</b></span> as well.[94]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>John Gould</span> <span style='color: green'><b>John_Gould</b></span> argues that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> should be understood as falling in a long line of story-tellers, rather than thinking of his means of explanation as a "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>philosophy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_philosophy</b></span> of history" or "simple <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>causality</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Causality</b></span>". Thus, according to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Gould</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Stephen_Jay_Gould</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s means of explanation is a mode of story-telling and narration that has been passed down from generations prior:[95]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' sense of what was 'going to happen' is not the language of one who holds a theory of historical necessity, who sees the whole of human experience as constrained by inevitability and without room for human choice or human responsibility, diminished and belittled by forces too large for comprehension or resistance; it is rather the traditional language of a teller of tales whose tale is structured by his awareness of the shape it must have and who presents human experience on the model of the narrative patterns that are built into his stories; the narrative <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>impulse</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Action_potential</b></span> itself, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>impulse</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Action_potential</b></span> towards 'closure' and the sense of an ending, is retrojected to become 'explanation'.[96]
<br>
<br>Although <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> considered his "inquiries" a serious pursuit of knowledge, he was not above relating entertaining tales derived from the collective body of myth, but he did so judiciously with regard for his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>historical method</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Historical_method</b></span>, by corroborating the stories through enquiry and testing their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>probability</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Probability</b></span>.[97] While the gods never make personal appearances in his account of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>human events</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Human_Events</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> states emphatically that "many things prove to me that the gods take part in the affairs of man" (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>IX</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Final_Fantasy_IX</b></span>, 100).
<br>
<br>In Book One, passages 23 and 24, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> relates the story of <span style='color: blue'><b>Arion</b></span>, the renowned <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>harp</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Harp</b></span> player, "second to no man living at that time," who was saved by a dolphin. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> prefaces the story by noting that "a very wonderful thing is said to have happened," and alleges its veracity by adding that the "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Corinth</b></span> and the Lesbians agree in their account of the matter." Having become very rich while at the court of <span style='color: blue'><b>Periander</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Arion</b></span> conceived a desire to sail to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Italy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Italy</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicily</b></span>. He hired a vessel crewed by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Corinth</b></span>, whom he felt he could <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>trust</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Trust_law</b></span>, but the sailors plotted to throw him overboard and seize his wealth. <span style='color: blue'><b>Arion</b></span> discovered the plot and begged for his life, but the crew gave him two options: that either he kill himself on the spot or jump ship and fend for himself in the sea. <span style='color: blue'><b>Arion</b></span> flung himself into the water, and a dolphin carried him to shore.[98]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> clearly writes as both historian and teller of tales. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> takes a fluid position between the artistic story-weaving of <span style='color: blue'><b>Homer</b></span> and the rational data-accounting of later historians. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>John Herrington</span> <span style='color: green'><b>John_Herrington</b></span> has developed a helpful <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>metaphor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Metaphor</b></span> for describing <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s dynamic position in the history of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Western art</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Art_of_Europe</b></span> and thought – <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>centaur</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Centaur</b></span>:
<br>
<br>The human forepart of the animal ... is the urbane and responsible <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>classical</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_antiquity</b></span> historian; the body indissolubly united to it is something out of the faraway mountains, out of an older, freer and wilder realm where our conventions have no force.[99]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> is neither a mere gatherer of data nor a simple teller of tales – he is both. While <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> is certainly concerned with giving accurate accounts of events, this does not preclude for him the insertion of powerful mythological elements into his narrative, elements which will aid him in expressing the truth of matters under his study. Thus to understand what <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> is doing in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, we must not impose strict demarcations between the man as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mythologist</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mythology</b></span> and the man as historian, or between the work as myth and the work as history. As <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>James</span> <span style='color: green'><b>James_VI_and_I</b></span> Romm has written, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> worked under a common <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ancient Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cultural assumption that the way events are remembered and retold (e.g. in myths or legends) produces a valid kind of understanding, even when this retelling is not entirely factual.[100] For <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>
