The Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span>, or Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemision</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artemisium</b></span>, was a series of naval engagements over three days during the second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> took place simultaneously with the more famous land <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, in August or September 480 BC, off the coast of <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span> and was fought between an alliance of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states, including <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> and others, and the Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion was a delayed response to the defeat of the first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, which had been ended by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> victory at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>King Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>massed a huge army and navy, and set out to conquer all of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> general <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> proposed that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> block the advance of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army at the pass of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> and simultaneously block the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> navy at the Straits of <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span>. An <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> naval force of 271 triremes was thus dispatched to await the arrival of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Approaching <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span> towards the end of summer, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> navy was caught in a gale off the coast of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Magnesia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Magnesia_Prefecture</b></span> and lost around a third of their 1200 ships. After arriving at <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> sent a detachment of 200 ships around the coast of <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span> in an attempt to trap the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, but these were caught in another storm and shipwrecked. The main action of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> took place after two days of smaller engagements. The two sides fought all day, with roughly equal losses; however, the smaller <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet could not afford the losses.
<br>
<br>After the engagement, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> received news of the defeat of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> army at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>. Since their strategy required both <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span> to be held, and given their losses, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> decided to withdraw to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> overran and gained control over <span style='color: blue'><b>Phocis</b></span>, then <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span>, and finally entered <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span> where they captured the now-evacuated <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>. However, seeking a decisive victory over the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were later defeated at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> in late 480 BC. Fearing being trapped in <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> withdrew with much of his army to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>, leaving <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> to complete the conquest of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. The following year, however, saw an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> army decisively defeat the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> at the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>, thereby ending the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>main source</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Main_Source</b></span> for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> is the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, who has been called the 'Father of History',[3] was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> (then under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> overlordship). He wrote his 'Enquiries' (Greek—Historia; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>English</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kingdom_of_England</b></span>—(The) <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span>) around 440–420 BC, trying to trace the origins of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ending in 450 BC).[4] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented 'history' as we know it.[4] As <span style='color: blue'><b>Holland</b></span> has it: "For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>manifest destiny</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Manifest_destiny</b></span>, but rather explanations he could verify personally."[4]
<br>
<br>Some subsequent ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, starting with <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>.[5][6] Nevertheless, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> chose to begin his history where <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> left off (at the Siege of Sestos), and therefore evidently felt that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting.[6] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> criticised <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> in his essay "On The Malignity of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>", describing <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> as "Philobarbaros" (barbarian-lover), for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed.[7] A negative view of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> was passed on to <span style='color: blue'><b>Renaissance</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>, though he remained well read.[8] However, since the 19th century, archaeological finds that support his version of events have considerably rehabilitated his reputation.[9] The prevailing modern view is that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> generally did a remarkable job in his Historia, but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>skepticism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Skepticism</b></span>.[9] Nevertheless, there are still some historians who believe <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> made up much of his story.[10]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Sicilian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Sicilian</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Diodorus Siculus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Diodorus_Siculus</b></span>, writing in the 1st century BC in his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bibliotheca Historica</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bibliotheca_historica</b></span>, also provides an account of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, partially derived from the earlier <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephorus</b></span>. This account is fairly consistent with <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s.[11] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Ctesias</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cnidus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Knidos</b></span>, and are referred to by other authors, such as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>playwright</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Theatre</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeschylus</b></span>. Archaeological evidence, such as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Serpent Column</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Serpent_Column</b></span>, also supports some of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s specific claims.[12]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> had supported the unsuccessful <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> against the Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> in 499-494 BC. The Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> was still relatively young, and prone to revolts amongst its subject peoples.[13][14] Moreover, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> was an usurper, and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule.[13] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> threatened the integrity of his empire, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> thus vowed to punish those involved (especially those not already part of the empire).[15][16] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> also saw the opportunity to expand his empire into the fractious world of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ancient Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[16] A preliminary expedition under <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> in 492 BC, to secure the land approaches to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, re-conquered <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span>, and forced <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span> to become a fully subordinate <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>client kingdom</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Client_state</b></span> part of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[17][18][19] It had been made a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vassal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vassal</b></span> or ally as early as the late 6th century BC, but remained having autonomy.[19] <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>' campaign of 492 BC changed this.[19]
<br>
<br>In 491 BC, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> sent emissaries to all the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states, asking for a gift of 'earth and water' in token of their submission to him.[20] Having had a demonstration of his power the previous year, the majority of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities duly obliged. In <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, however, the ambassadors were put on trial and then executed by throwing them in a pit; in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, they were simply thrown down a well.[20][21] This meant that <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> was also effectively at war with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[20]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> thus put together an amphibious task force under Datis and <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> in 490 BC, which attacked <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>, before receiving the submission of the other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cycladic Islands</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyclades</b></span>. The task force then moved on <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>, which it besieged and destroyed.[22] Finally, it moved to attack <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, landing at the bay of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, where it was met by a heavily outnumbered <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> army. At the ensuing Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, the Athenians won a remarkable victory, which resulted in the withdrawal of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>.[23]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> therefore began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>; however, in 486 BC, his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> expedition.[14] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> then died whilst preparing to march on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</b></span>, and the throne of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> passed to his son <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>.[24] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> crushed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemy_V_Epiphanes</b></span>, and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[25] Since this was to be a full-scale invasion, it required long-term planning, stock-piling and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>conscription</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Conscription</b></span>.[25] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> decided that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> would be bridged to allow his army to cross to <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>, and that a canal should be dug across the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>isthmus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Isthmus_of_Corinth</b></span> of Mount <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mount_Athos</b></span> (rounding which <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>headland</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Headlands_and_bays</b></span>, a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC).[26] These were both feats of exceptional ambition, which would have been beyond any contemporary state.[26] By early 480 BC, the preparations were complete, and the army <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> had mustered at <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> marched towards <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>, crossing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> on two pontoon bridges.[27]
<br>
<br>The Athenians had also been preparing for war with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> since the mid-<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>480s BC</span> <span style='color: green'><b>480s_BC</b></span>, and in 482 BC the decision was taken, under the guidance of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> politician <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, to build a massive fleet of triremes that would be necessary for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> to fight the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[28] However, the Athenians did not have the manpower to fight on land and sea; and therefore combating the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> would require an alliance of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> states. In 481 BC, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> sent ambassadors around <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> asking for earth and water, but making the very deliberate omission of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>.[29] Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states. A congress of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> states met at <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>late autumn</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Late_Autumn_(1960_film)</b></span> of 481 BC,[30] and a confederate alliance of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states was formed. It had the power to send envoys asking for assistance and to dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points after joint consultation. This was remarkable for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>disjointed</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Disjointed</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> world, especially since many of the city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.[31]
<br>
<br>The 'congress' met again in the spring of 480 BC. A <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thessalian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thessaly</b></span> delegation suggested that the allies could muster in the narrow Vale of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tempe</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vale_of_Tempe</b></span>, on the borders of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thessaly</b></span>, and thereby block <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>'s advance.[32] A force of 10,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> was dispatched to the Vale of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tempe</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vale_of_Tempe</b></span>, through which they believed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army would have to pass. However, once there, they were warned by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> I of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span> that the vale could be bypassed through the Sarantoporo Pass, and that the army of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> was overwhelming, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> retreated.[33] Shortly afterwards, they received the news that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> had crossed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span>.[32]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> therefore suggested a second strategy to the allies. The route to southern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> (<span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>) would require the army of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> to travel through the very narrow pass of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>. The pass could easily be blocked by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>, despite the overwhelming numbers of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. Furthermore, to prevent the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> bypassing <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> by sea, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and allied navies could block the straits of <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span>. This dual strategy was adopted by the congress.[34] However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> should all else fail, whilst the women and children of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> were evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Troezen</b></span>.[35]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet sailed north to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cape Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artemisium</b></span> once it became known that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army was advancing along the coast past <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mount Olympus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mount_Olympus</b></span>, probably around late July or the beginning of August.[36] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> took up station at <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span>, most likely beaching their ships at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>headland</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Headlands_and_bays</b></span>, from which they could quickly launch them as needed.[37] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> sent three ships to <span style='color: blue'><b>Skiathos</b></span> as scouts to provide warning of the approach of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet but [38] two weeks passed without sight. Finally, ten Sidonian triremes arrived off <span style='color: blue'><b>Skiathos</b></span>, and the main <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet was informed by a fire-beacon lit on the island.[38][39] However, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> patrol ships themselves were caught unaware and two were captured, whilst one ran aground.[37] According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, in the ensuing confusion, unsure whether or not the beacon heralded the arrival of the whole <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet, as a precaution the whole <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet launched into the straits of <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span>.[37][39] Once it became clear that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet was not going to arrive that day, they decided to sail to <span style='color: blue'><b>Chalcis</b></span>, halfway down on the western coast of <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span>, leaving men on the heights of <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span> to warn of the actual arrival of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> ships.[39]
<br>
<br>Historians suggest that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> may have misinterpreted the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> movements and come to the mistaken conclusion that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were sailing east around <span style='color: blue'><b>Skiathos</b></span>, aiming to sail around the eastern side of <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span>.[40] The signals sent by fire beacons must have been very simplistic, and potentially interpreted wrongly; alternatively, the signallers may have genuinely believed that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet was sailing to the east of <span style='color: blue'><b>Skiathos</b></span>.[40] If the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> sailed around the outer, eastern side of <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span>, they could head straight to <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>, and thereby cut off the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet's line of retreat.[40] Furthermore, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> had enough ships to attempt to both attack the Straits of <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span>, and sail around <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span>.[37] The withdrawal to <span style='color: blue'><b>Chalcis</b></span> therefore gave the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> the opportunity to escape from the Straits of <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span> if the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> did travel around the outside of <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span>, but also allowed them to return to <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span> if necessary. In this context, the watchers left on <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span> could inform the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> if the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet did indeed sail east of <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span>.[40] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet thus continued to wait at <span style='color: blue'><b>Chalcis</b></span>.[37] Nevertheless, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span>, undoubtedly anxious about facing a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet that so greatly outnumbered them, may have somewhat overreacted.[37]
<br>
<br>Around ten days later, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army arrived at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Chalcis</b></span> were informed by a ship, captained by Abronichus, which had been appointed to liaise between the army and the fleet.[37] However, there was still no sign of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet, and the first day the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> spent at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> passed without them launching an attack.[41] The next day, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet finally drew near to <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span>, heading for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Gap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gap_Inc.</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Skiathos</b></span> (between the coast of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Magnesia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Magnesia_Prefecture</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Skiathos</b></span>), when a summer gale (a 'Hellesponter' - probably a north-easterly storm[42]) broke, driving the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet onto the mountainous coast.[41][43] The storm lasted two days, wrecking approximately one third of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> ships.[41][44] Meanwhile, at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> had continued to wait for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> to disperse, also choosing not to attack during the storm.[41]
<br>
<br>The day after the storm finished, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet returned to <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span> to protect the flank of the army at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>.[41] The following day, (the fifth since the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> had arrived at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>) the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army began their attacks on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> army at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>. The same day, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet finally appeared through the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Gap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gap_Inc.</b></span> of Sciathos, and began mooring on the coast opposite <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span>, at Aphetae.[44] According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, 15 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> ships blundered into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> lines, and were captured.[45] Although clearly storm damaged, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet still probably outnumbered the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> by nearly 3:1.[44] As a result, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> contemplated withdrawing completely.[46] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Euboeans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Euboea</b></span>, not wanting to be abandoned to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, bribed <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> to try to ensure that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet remained.[46] Since the joint operation at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span> was his strategy in the first place, it is likely this is exactly what <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> wanted, and this bribe allowed him in turn to bribe the Spartan and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corinth</b></span> admirals, <span style='color: blue'><b>Eurybiades</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Adeimantus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Adeimantus_of_Corinth</b></span> to remain at <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span>.[44]
<br>
<br>Later on that day, a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>deserter</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Desertion</b></span> from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet, a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> called Scyllias, swam into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> camp. He brought bad news for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> — whilst most of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet was undergoing repairs, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> had detached 200 seaworthy ships to sail around the outer coast of <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span>, to block the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>escape route</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Escape_Route</b></span> of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet.[44][47] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> did not want to attack the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> yet, because they thought the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> would simply flee, and so they sought to trap them.[48] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> resolved to go and meet this detachment, to prevent being trapped, though they planned to leave by nightfall to prevent the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> becoming aware of their plans.[49]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> most likely realised that this situation presented them with an opportunity to destroy an isolated part of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet.[42][44] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> is not clear on where the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> planned to meet this detachment, only that they resolved to do so. One possibility is that they planned to sail down the Straits of <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span>, and hope that the other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> ships, patrolling the coast of <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>,[Note 1] followed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> as they entered the Straits of <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span> from the south; then the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> might themselves be caught in a trap.[44] Alternatively, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> may have planned to ambush the detachment as it passed by <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span>, on its journey from Aphetae.[42] Either way, they decided to make a demonstration towards the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> lines during what remained of the day, to convince the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> that they were planning to stay at <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span>.[42][44] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> also suggests that this was an opportunity for them to assess <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> seamanship and tactics.[49] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> probably waited until late afternoon so that there was little chance of being drawn into a full scale engagement; they did not want to suffer casualties before sailing to meet to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> detachment.[42] These decisions finally led to the beginning of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>.[44]
<br>
<br>The exact chronology of the battles of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span>, and their relation to each other is somewhat unclear. The chronology below represents an estimated reconstruction of the time-line, following Lazenby and <span style='color: blue'><b>Holland</b></span>.[50][51]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> gives a detailed description of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet that assembled at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Doriskos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Doriscus</b></span> in spring 480 BC (see table).[52] However, after the fleet was struck the storm off the coast of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Magnesia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Magnesia_Prefecture</b></span>, approximately one third of the fleet was lost.[43] Thus, by <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>reckoning</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Devil_(Dungeons_&_Dragons)</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet would have had approximately 800 triremes at <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span>.[44]
<br>
<br>Some modern scholars have accepted these numbers, especially since the ancient sources are unusually consistent on this point.[59][60][61] Other authors reject this number, with 1,207 being seen as more of a reference to the combined <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet in the <span style='color: blue'><b>Iliad</b></span>, and generally claim that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span>.[61][62][63]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> claims there were 280 ships in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet at the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span>, made up of the following contingents (numbers in parentheses refer to Penteconters, other ships are all Triremes):
<br>
<br>The Athenians had been building up a large fleet since 483 BC, ostensibly for their ongoing conflict with <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span>.[66][67] However, it is probable that this build up, initiated by <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, was also made with a future conflict with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> in mind.[66][67] The Athenians initially requested command of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet, but let <span style='color: blue'><b>Eurybiades</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> command it to preserve unity.[68]
<br>
<br>Strategically, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> mission was simple. The fleet needed to protect the flank of the army at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, whilst not being cut off themselves.[42][69] For the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, the strategic situation was equally simple, although with more options. They needed to force their way through either one of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> or <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span> (since holding both was necessary for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> effort), or to outflank either position.[42][70][71] Outflanking the Straits of <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span> was theoretically much easier than outflanking <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, by sailing around the east coast of <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span>.[71] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> position at <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span> may have been chosen in order to watch for such attempts. If narrowness of the channel had been the only <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>determinant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Determinant</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> could have found a better position near the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histiaea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Oreus</b></span>.[71]

<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> were at a significant tactical advantage, outnumbering the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> and having "better sailing" ships.[72] The "better sailing" that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> mentions was probably due to the superior seamanship of the crews;[72] most of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> ships (and therefore the majority of the fleet) were newly built, and had inexperienced crews.[73] The most common <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>naval tactics</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sailing_ship_tactics</b></span> in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mediterranean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mediterranean_Sea</b></span> area at the time were ramming (triremes were equipped with a ram at the bows), or boarding by ship-borne marines (which essentially turned a sea <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> into a land one).[74] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> and Asiatic <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> had by this time begun to use a manoeuver known as diekplous. It is not entirely clear what this was, but it probably involved sailing into gaps between enemy ships and then ramming them in the side.[74] This maneuver would have required skilled sailing, and therefore the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> would have been more likely to employ it. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span>, however, developed tactics specifically to counter this.[74]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> suggests that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> ships were heavier and, by implication, less maneuverable.[75] Their weight would further reduce the likelihood of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> ships employing the diekplous.[74] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The source</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_Charmed_characters</b></span> of this heaviness is uncertain; possibly the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> ships were bulkier in construction.[74] Another suggestion is that the heaviness was caused by the weight of fully armoured <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> marines.[74] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> may have had extra marines on board if their ships were less maneuverable, since boarding would then be the main tactic available to them (at the cost of making the ships even heavier).[74] Indeed, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> refers to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> capturing ships, rather than sinking them.[76]
<br>
<br>When the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> saw the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet rowing towards them, they decided to seize the opportunity to attack, even though it was late in the day, as they thought they would win an easy victory.[77] They quickly advanced on the much smaller <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet.[77] However, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> had come up with a tactic for this situation, where they turned their "bows on to the barbarians, [and] they drew their sterns together in the middle".[76] This is usually taken to mean that they formed into a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>circle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Social_group</b></span>, with their rams pointing outwards;[44][72] <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> reports that in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span>, Peloponnesian fleets twice adopted a circular formation, with their sterns together.[72] However, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> does not actually use the word <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>circle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Social_group</b></span>, and Lazenby points out the difficulty of forming a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>circle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Social_group</b></span> of 250 ships (the Peloponnesian fleets had 30–40 ships).[72] It is thus possible the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> formed into more of a crescent formation, with the wings drawn back to prevent the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> ships sailing around the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> line.[72] Whatever the case, it seems likely that this maneuver was intended to negate the superior <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> seamanship, and perhaps specifically the use of diekplous.[72][76]
<br>
<br>Having assumed this formation upon the giving of a prearranged signal, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> ships moved suddenly outwards from this position at a second signal, rowing into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> ships and catching them off guard.[44] Their superior seamanship negated, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> came off worst from the encounter with 30 of their ships captured or sunk.[76] During the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek ship</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_Ship</b></span>, captained by Antidorus of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lemnos</b></span>, defected to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span>.[76] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Nightfall</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Guild_Wars_Nightfall</b></span> then ended the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> having fared better than they possibly expected to.[44]
<br>
<br>During the night, another storm broke (this time probably a thunder-storm, possibly with a south easterly <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>wind</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Wind</b></span>),[42] preventing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> from setting off southwards to counter the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> detachment sent around the outside of <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span>.[44] However, the storm also hit the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> detachment of ships, driving them off course and onto the rocky coast of 'the Hollows' of <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span>.[78] This part of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet was thus also shipwrecked, losing most of the ships.[79]
<br>
<br>The following day, which was also the second day of Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet, now recovering from the two storms, declined to attack the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span>, and instead attempted to make the fleet seaworthy again.[44][79] News of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>shipwreck</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Shipwreck</b></span> off <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span> reached the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> that day, as well as a reinforcement of 53 ships from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>.[79]
<br>
<br>Again waiting until late afternoon, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> took the opportunity to attack a patrol of Cilician ships, destroying them, before retreating as night fell.[79] These ships were possibly survivors of the wrecked detachment sent around <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span>, or were perhaps anchored in an isolated <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>harbour</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Harbor</b></span>.[72]
<br>
<br>On the third day of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet was ready to attack the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> lines in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>full force</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Full_Force</b></span>.[80] Seeing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet assemble, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> attempted to block the Straits of <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span> as best they could, and waited for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> to attack.[44] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> formed their ships into a semicircle and tried to enclose the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet, upon which the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> rowed forward and joined <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>.[81] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> raged all day long, with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> hard put to defend their line.[44] When the fleets finally disengaged at nightfall, both sides had suffered roughly equal losses.[81] However, the smaller <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet could scarcely afford such losses;[44] half the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> ships (the largest contingent in the fleet) were damaged or lost.[82]
<br>
<br>Returning to <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> saw that they would probably not be able to hold the line for another day, such were their losses.[44] They thus debated whether they should withdraw from <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span>, whilst they awaited news from <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>.[44] <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> ordered the men to slaughter and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>barbecue</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Barbecue</b></span> the flocks of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Euboeans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Euboea</b></span>, so that they would not fall into <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> hands.[83] Abronichus arrived on the liaison ship from <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> and told the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> of the destruction of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> rearguard at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>.[84] Since holding the Straits of <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span> now no longer held any strategic purpose, and given their losses, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> decided to evacuate immediately.[84]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> were alerted to the withdrawal of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> by a boat from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histiaea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Oreus</b></span>, but did not at first believe it.[85] They sent some ships to see if this was the case, and finding that it was, the whole fleet set sail for <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span> in the morning.[85] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> then sailed on to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histiaea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Oreus</b></span> and sacked the surrounding region.[85]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet sailed to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>, off the coast of <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>, to assist with the evacuation of the remaining Athenians. En route, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> left inscriptions addressed to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> crews of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet on all springs of water that they might stop at, asking them to defect to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> cause:[86]
<br>
<br>"Men of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>, that what you are doing is not proper, campaigning against your fathers and wishing to enslave <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. It would be best if you came on our side. But if this is not possible, at least during the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> stand aside and also beg the <span style='color: blue'><b>Carians</b></span> to do the same with you. But if you can not do either the one or the other, if you are chained by higher force and you can not defect during the operations, when we come at hand, act purposely as cowards remembering that we are of the same <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>blood</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Blood</b></span> and that the first cause of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>animosity</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Animosity_(band)</b></span> with the barbarians came from you."[86]
<br>
<br>Following <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army burned and sacked the Boeotian cities that had not submitted to them—Plataea and Thespiae—and then marched on the now evacuated <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>.[87] Meanwhile, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> (for the most part Peloponnesian) prepared to defend the Isthmus of <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span>, demolishing the single road that led through it, and building a wall across it.[88] As at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, to make this an effective strategy required the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> navy to stage a simultaneous <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>blockade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Blockade</b></span>, barring the passage of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> navy across the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Saronic Gulf</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Saronic_Gulf</b></span>, so that troops could not be landed directly on the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>.<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>[89</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Effects_of_Hurricane_Sandy_in_New_York</b></span>] However, instead of a mere <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>blockade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Blockade</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> persuaded the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> to seek a decisive victory against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet. Luring the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> navy into the Straits of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> in September, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet was able to destroy much of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet, which essentially ended the threat to the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>.[90]
<br>
<br>Fearing that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> might attack the bridges across the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> and trap his army in <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> retreated with much of the army back to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>.[91] He left a hand picked force under <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> to complete the conquest the following year.[92] However, under pressure from the Athenians, the Peloponnesian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> eventually agreed to try to force <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, and marched on <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>.[93] <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> retreated to <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span> to lure the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> into open terrain and the two sides eventually met near the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>.[93] There, at the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> in August 479 BC, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army won a decisive victory, destroying much of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army, and ending the invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[93] Meanwhile, at the near-simultaneous naval Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> destroyed much of the remaining <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet, thereby reducing the threat of further invasions.[94]
<br>
<br>Considered by itself, <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span> was a relatively insignificant <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> did not defeat the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> navy, nor prevent it from advancing further along the coast of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[44] Conversely, neither did the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> destroy the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet, nor irreparably weaken it.[95] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> was thus an indecisive one, which pleased neither side.[44][95]

<br>Nevertheless, in the wider context of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, it was a very significant <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> had demonstrated to themselves that they could stand up to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> navy, even having the better of some encounters.[44] For many of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> crews, it was their first taste of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, and the experience gained was invaluable at the forthcoming Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>.[96] Moreover, fighting the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span> allowed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> admirals to see how the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet performed, and gave them insights into how it might be beaten.[96][97] In addition, the events before and during <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span> were crucial in cutting down the size of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet (even if this was not all due to military action), meaning that the odds faced by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> were not overwhelming.[44][78][98] As the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>poet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Poetry</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Pindar</b></span> put it, <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemisium</b></span>
