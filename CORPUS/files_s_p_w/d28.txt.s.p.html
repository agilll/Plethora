The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Delian League</a> (or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Athenian League</a>) was an alliance of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> city-states led by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> and formed in 478 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> to liberate eastern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> cities from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> rule and as a defence to possible revenge attacks from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persia</a> following the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> victories at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Marathon</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Salamis</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Plataea?lang=en'>Plataea</a> in the early 5th century <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>. The alliance of over 300 cities would eventually be so dominated by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> that, in effect, it evolved into the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Athenian empire</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> became increasingly more aggressive in its control of the alliance and, on occasion, constrained membership by military force and compelled continued tribute which was in the form of money, ships or materials. Following <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>’ defeat at the hands of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian War</a> in 404 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> the League was dissolved.
<br>
<br>The name <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Delian League</a> is a modern one, the ancient sources refer to it as simply ‘the alliance’ (symmachia) or ‘<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> and its allies’. The name is appropriate because the treasury of the alliance was located on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sacred_Island?lang=en'>sacred island</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delos?lang=en'>Delos</a> in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyclades?lang=en'>Cyclades</a>. The number of members of the League changed over time but around 330 are recorded in tribute lists; sources which are known to be incomplete. The majority of states were from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a> and the islands but most parts of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> were represented and later there were even some non-Greek members such as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carians?lang=en'>Carian</a> city-states. Prominent members included:
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegina?lang=en'>Aegina</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Byzantium?lang=en'>Byzantium</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chios?lang=en'>Chios</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lesbos?lang=en'>Lesbos</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lindos?lang=en'>Lindos</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naxos?lang=en'>Naxos</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paros?lang=en'>Paros</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samos?lang=en'>Samos</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thasos?lang=en'>Thasos</a>
<br>
<br>Initially members swore to hold the same enemies and allies by taking an oath. It is likely that each <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polis?lang=en'>city-state</a> had an equal vote in meetings held on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delos?lang=en'>Delos</a>. Members were expected to give tribute (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phoros?lang=en'>phoros</a>) to the treasury which was used to build and maintain the naval fleet led by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>. Significantly too, the treasury was controlled by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Athenian</a> treasurers, the ten Hellenotamiae. The tribute in the early stages was 460 talents (raised in 425 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> to 1,500), a figure decided by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Athenian</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Winston_Churchill?lang=en'>statesman</a> and general Aristides. An alternative to providing money was to give ships and/or materials (especially timber) and grain.
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Delian League</a> enjoyed some notable military victories such as at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eion?lang=en'>Eion</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallipoli?lang=en'>Thracian Chersonese</a>, and most famously, at the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Giants_(Greek_mythology)?lang=en'>Eurymedon</a> in 466 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>, all against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> forces. As a consequence <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> garrisons were removed from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrace?lang=en'>Thrace</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chersonesus?lang=en'>Chersonesus</a>. In 450 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> the League seemed to have achieved its aim if the Peace of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Callias_III?lang=en'>Kallias</a> is to be considered genuine. Here the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> were limited in their field of influence and direct hostilities ended between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persia</a>.
<br>
<br>Other successes of the League were not military but economic and political, making them more difficult to determine in their significance and real effect for all members. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piracy?lang=en'>Piracy</a> was practically eliminated in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegean_Sea?lang=en'>Aegean</a>, inter-city trade increased, a common coinage was introduced (the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Athenian</a> silver <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tetradrachm?lang=en'>tetradrachm</a>), taxation became centralised, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athenian_democracy?lang=en'>democracy</a> as a form of government was promoted, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/European_Court_of_Justice?lang=en'>judiciary</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> was accessible to member’s citizens, and such tools as measurement standards became uniform across the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegean_Sea?lang=en'>Aegean</a>. The primary beneficiary of all of these was certainly <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> and the massive re-building project of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a>, begun by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pericles?lang=en'>Pericles</a> and which included the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parthenon?lang=en'>Parthenon</a>, was partially funded by the League treasury.
<br>
<br>The League and its requirement of tribute was not always to the liking of its members and some did try and leave, especially as the threat from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persia</a> gradually receded and the calls for tribute increased. A notable example is <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naxos?lang=en'>Naxos</a> who sought to secede c. 467 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> responded in dramatic fashion by attacking the island and making it a semi-dependency, albeit with a lower tribute. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thasos?lang=en'>Thasos</a> was another member who disagreed with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> and wanted to keep control of its mines and trade centres. Again, the Athenians responded with force in 465 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> and lay <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Siege?lang=en'>siege</a> to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> for three years. Eventually, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thasos?lang=en'>Thasos</a> capitulated. 
<br>
<br>Already looking like an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Athenian empire</a>, two further episodes changed the League forever. In 460 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>First Peloponnesian War</a> broke out between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>, and their allies. For the first time the League was being used against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> city-states and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persia</a> was off the agenda. Then c. 454 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> used the excuse of a failed League expedition in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ptolemaic_Kingdom?lang=en'>Egypt</a> (to aid the anti-Persian prince <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Inaros_II?lang=en'>Inarus</a>) to move the League treasury to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>.
<br>
<br>The League became, thenceforth, ever more difficult to keep in toe. In 446 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> lost the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Koroneia,_Boeotia?lang=en'>Koroneia</a> and had to repress a major revolt in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Euboea?lang=en'>Euboea</a>. An even more serious episode occurred when fighting between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samos?lang=en'>Samos</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletos</a> (both League members) was escalated by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> into a war. Again the Athenians’ superior resources brought them victory in 439 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>. Yet another revolt broke out in Poteidaia in 432 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> which brought <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Delian League</a> in direct opposition to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>’s own alliance, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_League?lang=en'>Peloponnesian League</a>. This second and much more damaging <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian War</a> (432-404 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>) against a Persian-backed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> would eventually, after 30 years of gruelling and resource-draining conflicts, bring <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> to her knees and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wrestling_ring?lang=en'>ring</a> the death knell for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Delian League</a>. Such disastrous defeats as the 415 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicilian_Expedition?lang=en'>Sicilian Expedition</a> and the brutal execution of all males on rebellious Melos the previous year were indicators of the desperate times. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>’ <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Little_Mix_discography?lang=en'>glory days</a> were gone and with them, so too, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Delian League</a>.
<br>
<br>The benefits of the League had been, certainly, mostly for the Athenians, nevertheless, it is significant that the realistic alternative – Spartan rule – would not have been and, from 404 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>, was not any more popular for the lesser states of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>. This is perhaps indicated by their willingness to re-join with, albeit a weaker and more militarily passive, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Second_Athenian_Empire?lang=en'>Second Athenian Confederacy</a> from 377 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>
