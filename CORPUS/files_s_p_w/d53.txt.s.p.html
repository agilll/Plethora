The History of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian War</a> (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a>: Ἱστορίαι, "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Histories</a>") is a historical account of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian War</a> (431–404 BC), which was fought between the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_League?lang=en'>Peloponnesian League</a> (led by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>) and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Delian League</a> (led by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>). It was written by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>, an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athenian</a> historian who also happened to serve as an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athenian</a> general during the war. His account of the conflict is widely considered to be a classic and regarded as one of the earliest scholarly works of history. The History is divided into eight books.
<br>
<br>Analyses of the History generally occur in one of two camps.[1] On the one hand, some scholars view the work as an objective and scientific piece of history. The judgment of J. B. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bury?lang=en'>Bury</a> reflects his traditional interpretation of the work: "[The History is] severe in its detachment, written from a purely intellectual point of view, unencumbered with platitudes and moral judgments, cold and critical."[2]
<br>
<br>On the other hand, in keeping with more recent interpretations that are associated with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reader-response_criticism?lang=en'>reader-response criticism</a>, the History can be read as a piece of literature rather than an objective record of the historical events. This view is embodied in the words of W. R. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Assassin's_Creed_characters?lang=en'>Connor</a>, who describes <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> as "an artist who responds to, selects and skillfully arranges his material, and develops its symbolic and emotional potential."[3]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> is considered to be one of the great "fathers" of Western history, thus making his methodology the subject of much analysis in area of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Historiography?lang=en'>historiography</a>.[citation needed]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> is one of the first western historians to employ a strict standard of chronology, recording events by year, with each year consisting of the summer campaign season and a less active winter season. This method contrasts sharply with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> also makes extensive use of speeches in order to elaborate on the event in question. While the inclusion of long <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Narration?lang=en'>first-person</a> speeches is somewhat alien to modern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Historical_method?lang=en'>historical method</a>, in the context of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>ancient Greek</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oral_tradition?lang=en'>oral culture</a> speeches are expected. These include addresses given to troops by their generals before battles and numerous political speeches, both by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athenian</a> and Spartan leaders, as well as debates between various parties. Of the speeches, the most famous is the funeral oration of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pericles?lang=en'>Pericles</a>, which is found in Book Two. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> undoubtedly heard some of these speeches himself while for others he relied on eyewitness accounts.
<br>
<br>These speeches are suspect in the eyes of Classicists, however, inasmuch as it is not sure to what degree <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> altered these speeches in order to most clearly elucidate the crux of the argument presented. Some of the speeches are probably fabricated according to his expectations of, as he puts it, "what was called for in each situation" (1.22.1).[4]
<br>
<br>Despite being an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athenian</a> and a participant in the conflict, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> is often regarded as having written a generally unbiased account of the conflict with respect to the sides involved in it. In the introduction to the piece he states, "my work is not a piece of writing designed to meet the taste of an immediate public, but was done to last for ever" (1.22.4).
<br>
<br>There are scholars, however, who doubt this. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ernst_Badian?lang=en'>Ernst Badian</a>, for example has argued that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> has a strong pro-Athenian bias.[5] In keeping with this sort of doubt, other scholars claim that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> had an ulterior motive in his <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Histories</a>, specifically to create an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epic_poetry?lang=en'>epic</a> comparable to those of the past such as the works of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer?lang=en'>Homer</a>, and that this led him to create a nonobjective <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dualism?lang=en'>dualism</a> favoring the Athenians.[6] The work does display a clear bias against certain people involved in the conflict, such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cleon?lang=en'>Cleon</a>.[7]
<br>
<br>The gods play no active role in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>' work. This is very different from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, who frequently mentions the role of the gods, as well as a nearly ubiquitous divine presence in the centuries-earlier poems of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer?lang=en'>Homer</a>. Instead, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> regards history as being caused by the choices and actions of human beings.
<br>
<br>Despite the absence of actions of the gods, religion and piety play critical roles in the actions of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a>, and to a lesser degree, the Athenians.[8] Thus natural occurrences such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Earthquake?lang=en'>earthquake</a> and eclipses were viewed as religiously significant (1.23.3; 7.50.4)[9]
<br>
<br>Despite the absence of the gods from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>' work, he still draws heavily from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_mythology?lang=en'>Greek mythos</a>, especially from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer?lang=en'>Homer</a>, whose works are prominent in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_mythology?lang=en'>Greek mythology</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> references <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer?lang=en'>Homer</a> frequently as a source of information, but always <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Applied_Digital_Data_Systems?lang=en'>adds</a> a distancing <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clause?lang=en'>clause</a>, such as "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer?lang=en'>Homer</a> shows this, if that is sufficient evidence," and "assuming we should <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trust_law?lang=en'>trust</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer?lang=en'>Homer</a>'s poetry in this case too."[10]
<br>
<br>However, despite <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>' lack of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trust_law?lang=en'>trust</a> in information that was not experienced firsthand, such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer?lang=en'>Homer</a>'s, he does use the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poetry?lang=en'>poet</a>'s epics to infer facts about the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trojan_War?lang=en'>Trojan War</a>. For instance, while <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> considered the number of over 1,000 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> ships sent to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Troy?lang=en'>Troy</a> to be a poetic exaggeration, he uses <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer?lang=en'>Homer</a>'s Catalog of Ships to determine the approximate number of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> soldiers who were present. Later, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> claims that since <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer?lang=en'>Homer</a> never makes reference to a united <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> state, the pre-Hellenic nations must have been so <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Disjointed?lang=en'>disjointed</a> that they could not organize properly to launch an effective campaign. In fact, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> claims that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Troy?lang=en'>Troy</a> could have been conquered in half the time had the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> leaders allocated resources properly and not sent a large portion of the army on raids for supplies.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> makes sure to inform his reader that he, unlike <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer?lang=en'>Homer</a>, is not a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poetry?lang=en'>poet</a> prone to exaggeration, but instead a historian, whose stories may not give "momentary pleasure," but "whose intended meaning will be challenged by the truth of the facts."[11] By distancing himself from the storytelling practices of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer?lang=en'>Homer</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> makes it clear that while he does consider <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mythology?lang=en'>mythology</a> and epics to be evidence, these works cannot be given much credibility, and that it takes an impartial and empirically minded historian, such as himself, to accurately portray the events of the past.
<br>
<br>The first book of the History, after a brief review of early <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> history and some programmatic <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Historiography?lang=en'>historiographical</a> commentary, seeks to explain why the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian War</a> broke out when it did and what its causes were. Except for a few short excursuses (notably 6.54–58 on the Tyrant <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Slayers?lang=en'>Slayers</a>), the remainder of the History (books 2 through 8) rigidly maintains its focus on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian War</a> to the exclusion of other topics.
<br>
<br>While the History concentrates on the military aspects of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian War</a>, it uses these events as a medium to suggest several other themes closely related to the war. It specifically discusses in several passages the socially and culturally degenerative effects of war on humanity itself. The History is especially concerned with the lawlessness and atrocities committed by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> citizens to each other in the name of one side or another in the war. Some events depicted in the History, such as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Siege_of_Melos?lang=en'>Melian dialogue</a>, describe early instances of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Realpolitik?lang=en'>realpolitik</a> or power politics.
<br>
<br>The History is preoccupied with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Interplay_Entertainment?lang=en'>interplay</a> of justice and power in political and military decision-making. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>' presentation is <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decidedly?lang=en'>decidedly</a> ambivalent on this theme. While the History seems to suggest that considerations of justice are artificial and necessarily capitulate to power, it sometimes also shows a significant degree of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empathy?lang=en'>empathy</a> with those who suffer from the exigencies of the war.
<br>
<br>For the most part, the History does not discuss topics such as the art and architecture of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>.
<br>
<br>The History emphasizes the development of military technologies. In several passages (1.14.3, 2.75–76, 7.36.2–3), <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> describes in detail various innovations in the conduct of siegeworks or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naval_warfare?lang=en'>naval warfare</a>. The History places great importance upon naval supremacy, arguing that a modern empire is impossible without a strong navy. He states that this is the result of the development of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piracy?lang=en'>piracy</a> and coastal settlements in earlier <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>.
<br>
<br>Important in this regard was the development, at the beginning of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_antiquity?lang=en'>classical</a> period (c. 500 BC), of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trireme?lang=en'>trireme</a>, the supreme <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naval_ship?lang=en'>naval ship</a> for the next several hundred years. In his emphasis on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naval_warfare?lang=en'>sea power</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> resembles the modern naval theorist <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alfred_the_Great?lang=en'>Alfred</a> Thayer <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alfred_Thayer_Mahan?lang=en'>Mahan</a>, whose influential work The Influence of Sea Power upon History helped set in motion the naval <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arms_race?lang=en'>arms race</a> prior to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/World_War_I?lang=en'>World War I</a>.
<br>
<br>The History explains that the primary cause of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian War</a> was the "growth in power of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>, and the alarm which this inspired in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>" (1.23.6). <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> traces the development of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athenian</a> power through the growth of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Athenian empire</a> in the years 479 BC to 432 BC in book one of the History (1.89–118). The legitimacy of the empire is explored in several passages, notably in the speech at 1.73–78, where an anonymous <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athenian</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Papal_legate?lang=en'>legation</a> defends the empire on the grounds that it was freely given to the Athenians and not taken by force. The subsequent expansion of the empire is defended by these Athenians, "...the nature of the case first compelled us to advance our empire to its present height; fear being our principal motive, though honor and interest came afterward." (1.75.3)
<br>
<br>The Athenians also argue that, "We have done nothing extraordinary, nothing contrary to human nature in accepting an empire when it was offered to us and then in refusing to give it up." (1.76) They claim that anyone in their position would act in the same fashion. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> represent a more traditional, circumspect, and less expansive power. Indeed, the Athenians are nearly destroyed by their greatest act of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Imperial_overstretch?lang=en'>imperial overreach</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily?lang=en'>Sicilian</a> expedition, described in books six and seven of the History.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> correlates, in his description of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/426_BC_Malian_Gulf_tsunami?lang=en'>426 BC Malian Gulf tsunami</a>, for the first time in the recorded history of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science?lang=en'>natural science</a>, quakes and waves in terms of cause and effect.[12][13]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>' History is extraordinarily dense and complex. His particular <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>ancient Greek</a> prose is also very challenging, grammatically, syntactically, and semantically. This has resulted in much scholarly disagreement on a cluster of issues of interpretation.
<br>
<br>It is commonly thought that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> died while still working on the History, since it ends in mid-sentence and only goes up to 410 BC, leaving six years of war uncovered. Furthermore, there is a great deal of uncertainty whether he intended to revise the sections he had already written. Since there appear to be some contradictions between certain passages in the History, it has been proposed that the conflicting passages were written at different times and that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>' opinion on the conflicting matter had changed. Those who argue that the History can be divided into various levels of composition are usually called "analysts" and those who argue that the passages must be made to reconcile with one another are called "unitarians". This conflict is called the "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stratigraphy?lang=en'>strata</a> of composition" debate. The lack of progress in this debate over the course of the twentieth century has caused many <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydidean</a> scholars to declare the debate insoluble and to side-step the issue in their work.
<br>
<br>The History is notoriously reticent about its sources. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> almost never names his informants and alludes to competing versions of events only a handful of times. This is in marked contrast to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, who frequently mentions multiple versions of his stories and allows the reader to decide which is true. Instead, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> strives to create the impression of a seamless and irrefutable narrative. Nevertheless, scholars have sought to detect the sources behind the various sections of the History. For example, the narrative after <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>' exile (4.108ff.) seems to focus on Peloponnesian events more than the first four books, leading to the conclusion that he had greater access to Peloponnesian sources at that time.
<br>
<br>Frequently, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> appears to assert knowledge of the thoughts of individuals at key moments in the narrative. Scholars have asserted that these moments are evidence that he interviewed these individuals after the fact. However, the evidence of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicilian_Expedition?lang=en'>Sicilian Expedition</a> argues against this, since <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> discusses the thoughts of the generals who died there and whom he would have had no chance to interview. Instead it seems likely that, as with the speeches, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> is looser than previously thought in inferring the thoughts, feelings, and motives of principal characters in his History from their actions, as well as his own sense of what would be appropriate or likely in such a situation.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Historian?lang=en'>The historian</a> J. B. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bury?lang=en'>Bury</a> writes that the work of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> . . . "marks the longest and most decisive step that has ever been taken by a single man towards making history what it is today.”[14]
<br>
<br>Historian H. D. Kitto feels that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> wrote about the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian War</a> not because it was the most significant war in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>antiquity</a> but because it caused the most suffering. Indeed, several passages of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>' book are written "with an intensity of feeling hardly exceeded by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sappho?lang=en'>Sappho</a> herself."[15]
<br>
<br>In his Open Society and Its Enemies, Karl R. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Popper?lang=en'>Popper</a> writes that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> was the "greatest historian, perhaps, who ever lived." <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>' work, however, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Popper?lang=en'>Popper</a> goes on to say, represents "an interpretation, a point of view; and in this we need not agree with him." In the war between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athenian_democracy?lang=en'>Athenian democracy</a> and the "arrested <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oligarchy?lang=en'>oligarchic</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tribalism?lang=en'>tribalism</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>," we must never forget <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>' "involuntary bias," and that "his heart was not with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>, his native <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a>:"
<br>
<br>"Although he apparently did not belong to the extreme wing of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athenian</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oligarchy?lang=en'>oligarchic</a> clubs who conspired throughout the war with the enemy, he was certainly a member of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oligarchy?lang=en'>oligarchic</a> party, and a friend neither of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Athenian</a> people, the demos, who had exiled him, nor of its <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Imperialism?lang=en'>imperialist</a> policy."
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>' History has been enormously influential in both ancient and modern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Historiography?lang=en'>historiography</a>. It was embraced by many of the author's contemporaries and immediate successors with enthusiasm; indeed, many authors sought to complete the unfinished history. For example, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xenophon?lang=en'>Xenophon</a> wrote his <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hellenica?lang=en'>Hellenica</a> as a continuation of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>' work, beginning at the exact moment that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>' History leaves off. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xenophon?lang=en'>Xenophon</a>'s work, however, is generally considered inferior in style and accuracy compared with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>'.[citation needed] In later <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>antiquity</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>' reputation suffered somewhat, with critics such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus?lang=en'>Dionysius</a> of Halicarnassus rejecting the History as turgid and excessively austere. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucian?lang=en'>Lucian</a> also parodies it (among others) in his <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satire?lang=en'>satire</a> The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/True_History?lang=en'>True Histories</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Woodrow_Wilson?lang=en'>Woodrow Wilson</a> read the History on his voyage across the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Atlantic?lang=en'>Atlantic</a> to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris_Peace_Conference,_1919?lang=en'>Versailles Peace Conference</a>.[16]
<br>
<br>Most critics writing about the History, including this article, use a standard format to direct readers to passages in the text: book.chapter.section. For example, the notation that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pericles?lang=en'>Pericles</a>' last speech runs from 2.60.1 to 2.64.6, this means that it can be found in the second book, from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/60th_United_States_Congress?lang=en'>sixtieth</a> chapter through the sixty-fourth. Most modern editions and translations of the History include the chapter numbers in the margins.
