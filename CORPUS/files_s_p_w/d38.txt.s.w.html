The first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, during the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, began in 492 BC, and ended with the decisive <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> victory at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> in 490 BC. The invasion, consisting of two distinct campaigns, was ordered by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> king <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> primarily in order to punish the city-states of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>. These cities had supported the cities of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> during their revolt against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule, thus incurring the wrath of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> also saw the opportunity to extend his empire into <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>, and to secure its western <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>frontier</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Frontier</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The first campaign in 492 BC, led by <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>, re-subjugated <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span> and forced <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span> to become a fully subordinate <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>client kingdom</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Client_state</b></span> part of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, after being a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vassal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vassal</b></span> to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> as early as the late 6th century BC.[1] However, further progress was prevented when <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>'s fleet was wrecked in a storm off the coast of Mount <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mount_Athos</b></span>. The following year, having demonstrated his intentions, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> sent ambassadors to all parts of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, demanding their submission. He received it from almost all of them, except <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, both of whom executed the ambassadors. With <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> still defiant, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> now effectively at war with him, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> ordered a further military campaign for the following year.
<br>
<br>The second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> campaign, in 490 BC, was under the command of Datis and <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>. The expedition headed first to the island <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>, which it captured and burned. It then <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>island-hopped</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Island_hopping</b></span> between the rest of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cycladic Islands</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyclades</b></span>, annexing each into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> empire. Reaching <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, the expedition landed at <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>, which it besieged, and after a brief time, captured. <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> was razed and its citizens enslaved. Finally, the task force headed to <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>, landing at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, en route for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>. There, it was met by a smaller <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> army, which nevertheless proceeded to win a remarkable victory at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>.
<br>
<br>This defeat prevented the successful conclusion of the campaign, and the task force returned to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>. Nevertheless, the expedition had fulfilled most of its aims, punishing <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>, and bringing much of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule, as well as the full inclusion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span>. The unfinished business from this campaign led <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> to prepare for a much larger invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, to firmly subjugate it, and to punish <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>. However, internal strife within the empire delayed this expedition, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> then died of old age. It was thus left to his son <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> to lead the second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, beginning in 480 BC.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>main source</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Main_Source</b></span> for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> is the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, who has been called the 'Father of History',[2] was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> (then under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> overlordship). He wrote his 'Enquiries' (Greek—Historia; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>English</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kingdom_of_England</b></span>—(The) <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span>) around 440–430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ending in 450 BC).[3] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented 'history' as we know it.[3] As the British author <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tom Holland</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tom_Holland_(actor)</b></span> has it: "For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>manifest destiny</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Manifest_destiny</b></span>, but rather explanations he could verify personally."[3]
<br>
<br>Some subsequent ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, starting with <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>.[4][5] Nevertheless, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> chose to begin his history where <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> left off (at the Siege of Sestos), and therefore evidently felt that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting.[5] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> criticised <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> in his essay "On The Malignity of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>", describing <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> as "Philobarbaros" (barbarian-lover), for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed.[6] A negative view of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> was passed on to <span style='color: blue'><b>Renaissance</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>, though he remained well read.[7] However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaeological finds which have repeatedly confirmed his version of events.[8] The prevailing modern view is that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> generally did a remarkable job in his Historia, but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>skepticism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Skepticism</b></span>.[8] Nevertheless, there are still some historians who believe <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> made up much of his story.[9]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Sicilian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Sicilian</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Diodorus Siculus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Diodorus_Siculus</b></span>, writing in the 1st century BC in his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bibliotheca Historica</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bibliotheca_historica</b></span>, also provides an account of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, partially derived from the earlier <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephorus</b></span>. This account is fairly consistent with <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s.[10] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Ctesias</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cnidus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Knidos</b></span>, and are alluded by other authors, such as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>playwright</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Playwright</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeschylus</b></span>. Archaeological evidence, such as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Serpent Column</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Serpent_Column</b></span>, also supports some of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s specific claims.[11]
<br>
<br>The first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> had its immediate roots in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>, the earliest phase of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>. However, it was also the result of the longer-term interaction between the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. In 500 BC the Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> was still relatively young and highly expansionist, but prone to revolts amongst its subject peoples.[12][13][14] Moreover, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> king <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> was a usurper, and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule.[12] Even before the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> had begun to expand the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> into <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>, subjugating <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span>, expanding past the <span style='color: blue'><b>Danube</b></span> river, conquering <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Paeonia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peony</b></span>,[15] and forcing <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span> to become a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>client kingdom</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Client_state</b></span> to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>; though the latter retaining an amount of autonomy up to 492 BC.[16] Attempts at further expansion into the politically fractious world of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ancient Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> may have been inevitable.[13][17] However, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> had directly threatened the integrity of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> empire, and the states of mainland <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> remained a potential menace to its future stability.[18] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> thus resolved to subjugate and pacify <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span>, and to punish those involved in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>.[18][19]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> had begun with an unsuccessful expedition against <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>, a joint venture between the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>.[20] In the aftermath, <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> decided to remove <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> from power, but before he could do so, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> abdicated, and declared <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span>.[20] The other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> cities, ripe for rebellion, followed suit, ejecting their Persian-appointed tyrants, and declaring themselves democracies.[20][21] <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> then appealed to the states of Mainland <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> for support, but only <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> offered to send troops.[22]
<br>
<br>The involvement of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> arose from a complex set of circumstances, beginning with the establishment of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian Democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span> in the late 6th century BC.[22] In 510 BC, with the aid of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span>, King of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> people had expelled <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> ruler of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>.[23] With <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span>'s father <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peisistratus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peisistratos</b></span>, the family had ruled for 36 out of the previous 50 years and fully intended to continue <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span>'s rule.[23] <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span> fled to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> to the court of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>, and promised control of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> if they were to help restore him.[24] In the meantime, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span> helped install a pro-Spartan tyranny under <span style='color: blue'><b>Isagoras</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, in opposition to <span style='color: blue'><b>Cleisthenes</b></span>, the leader of the traditionally powerful <span style='color: blue'><b>Alcmaeonidae</b></span> family, who considered themselves the natural heirs to the rule of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>.[25] In a daring response, <span style='color: blue'><b>Cleisthenes</b></span> proposed to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> people that he would establish a '<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span>' in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, much to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>horror</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Horror_fiction</b></span> of the rest of the aristocracy. <span style='color: blue'><b>Cleisthenes</b></span>'s reasons for suggesting such a radical course of action, which would remove much of his own family's power, are unclear; perhaps he perceived that days of aristocratic rule were coming to an end anyway; certainly he wished to prevent <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> becoming a puppet of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> by whatever means necessary.[25] However, as a result of this proposal, <span style='color: blue'><b>Cleisthenes</b></span> and his family were exiled from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, in addition to other dissenting elements, by <span style='color: blue'><b>Isagoras</b></span>. Having been promised <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span> however, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> people seized the moment and revolted, expelling <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Isagoras</b></span>.[26] <span style='color: blue'><b>Cleisthenes</b></span> was thus restored to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> (507 BC), and at breakneck speed began to establish democratic government. The establishment of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span> revolutionised <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, which henceforth became one of the leading cities in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[26] The new-found freedom and self-governance of the Athenians meant that they were thereafter exceptionally hostile to the return of the tyranny of <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span>, or any form of outside subjugation; by <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> or anyone else.[26]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span>, unsurprisingly, was not pleased with events, and marched on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartan army</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>.[27] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span>'s attempts to restore <span style='color: blue'><b>Isagoras</b></span> to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> ended in a debacle, but fearing the worst, the Athenians had by this point already sent an embassy to <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>, to request aid from the Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span>.[28] <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> requested that the Athenians give him a 'earth and water', a traditional token of submission, which the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> ambassadors acquiesced to.[28] However, they were severely censured for this when they returned to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>.[28] At some point later <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span> instigated a plot to restore <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span> to the rule of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>. This failed and <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span> again fled to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> and tried to persuade the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> to subjugate <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>.[29] The Athenians dispatched ambassadors to <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> to dissuade him from taking action, but <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> merely instructed the Athenians to take <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span> back as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span>.[22] Needless to say, the Athenians balked at this, and resolved instead to be openly at war with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[29] Having thus become the enemy of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> was already in a position to support the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> cities when they began their revolt.[22] The fact that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> democracies were inspired by the example of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> no doubt further persuaded the Athenians to support the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>; especially since the cities of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> were (supposedly) originally <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> colonies.[22]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> also sent assistance to the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> for reasons that are not completely clear. Possibly commercial reasons were a factor; <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> was a mercantile <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>, whose trade was threatened by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> dominance of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span>.[22] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> suggests that the Eretrians supported the revolt in order to repay the support the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> had given <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> in a past war against <span style='color: blue'><b>Chalcis</b></span>.[30]
<br>
<br>The Athenians and Eretrians sent a task force of 25 triremes to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>.[31] Whilst there, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army surprised and outmaneuvered <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>, marching to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> and there burning the lower <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>.[32] However, this was as much as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> achieved, and they were then pursued back to the coast by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> horsemen, losing many men in the process. Despite the fact their actions were ultimately fruitless, the Eretrians and in particular the Athenians had earned <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>'s lasting enmity, and he vowed to punish both cities.[33] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> naval victory at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> (494 BC) all but ended the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>, and by 493 BC, the last hold-outs were vanquished by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet.[34] The revolt was used as an opportunity by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> to extend the empire's border to the islands of the East <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span>[35] and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Propontis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sea_of_Marmara</b></span>, which had not been part of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> dominions before.[36] The completion of the pacification of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> allowed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> to begin planning their next moves; to extinguish the threat to the empire from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, and to punish <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>.[37]
<br>
<br>In the spring of 492 BC an expeditionary force, to be commanded by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>'s son-in-law <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>, was assembled, consisting of a fleet and a land army.[38] Whilst the ultimate aim was to punish <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>, the expedition also aimed to subdue as many of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities as possible.[38][39] Departing from <span style='color: blue'><b>Cilicia</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> sent the army to march to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span>, whilst he travelled with the fleet.[38] He sailed round the coast of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> to <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>, where he spent a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>short time</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Short_Time</b></span> abolishing the tyrannies that ruled the cities of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>. Ironically, since the establishment of democracies had been a key factor in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>, he replaced the tyrannies with democracies.[38]
<br>
<br>Thence the fleet continued on to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span>, and when all was ready, shipped the land forces across to <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>.[38] The army then marched through <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span>, re-subjugating it, since these lands had already been added to the Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> in 512 BC, during <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>'s campaign against the <span style='color: blue'><b>Scythians</b></span>.[40] Upon reaching <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> forced it to become a fully subordinate part of the Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span>; they had been vassals of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> since the late 6th century BC, but retained their general autonomy.[16]
<br>
<br>Meanwhile, the fleet crossed to <span style='color: blue'><b>Thasos</b></span>, resulting in the Thasians submitting to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[39] The fleet then rounded the coastline as far as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Acanthus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Acanthus_(plant)</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chalcidice</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chalkidiki</b></span>, before attempting to round the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>headland</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Headlands_and_bays</b></span> of Mount <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mount_Athos</b></span>.[39] However, they were caught in a violent storm, which drove them against the coastline of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mount_Athos</b></span>, wrecking (according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>) 300 ships, with the loss of 20,000 men.[39]
<br>
<br>Then, whilst the army was camped in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Brygians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bryges</b></span>, a local <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thracian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thrace</b></span> tribe, launched a night raid against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> camp, killing many of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, and wounding <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>.[41] Despite his injury, <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> made sure that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Brygians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bryges</b></span> were defeated and subjugated, before leading his army back to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span>; the remnants of the navy also retreated to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>.[41] Although this campaign ended ingloriously, the land approaches to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> had been secured, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> had no doubt been made aware of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>'s intentions for them.[42]
<br>
<br>Perhaps reasoning that the expedition of the previous year may have made his plans for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> obvious, and weakened the resolve of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> turned to diplomacy in 491 BC. He sent ambassadors to all the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> states, asking for "earth and water", a traditional token of submission.[43] The vast majority of cities did as asked, fearing the wrath of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>. In <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, however, the ambassadors were put on trial and then executed; in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, they were simply thrown down a well.[42] This firmly and finally drew the battle-lines for the coming conflict; <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, despite their recent enmity, would together fight the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[42]
<br>
<br>However, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> was then thrown into disarray by internal <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>machinations</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Machinations_(band)</b></span>. The citizens of <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span> had submitted to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> ambassadors, and the Athenians, troubled by the possibility of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> using <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span> as a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>naval base</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Military_base</b></span>, asked <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> to intervene.[44] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span> travelled to <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span> to confront the Aeginetans personally, but they appealed to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span>'s fellow king <span style='color: blue'><b>Demaratus</b></span>, who supported their stance.[45] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span> responded by having <span style='color: blue'><b>Demaratus</b></span> declared illegitimate, with the help of the priests at <span style='color: blue'><b>Delphi</b></span> (whom he bribed); <span style='color: blue'><b>Demaratus</b></span> was replaced by his cousin <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leotychides</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leotychidas</b></span>.[44] Now faced with two <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartan kings</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_kings_of_Sparta</b></span>, the Aeginetans capitulated, and handed over hostages to the Athenians as a guarantee of their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>good behaviour</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Good_Behaviour</b></span>.[46] However, in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> news emerged of the bribes <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span> had given at <span style='color: blue'><b>Delphi</b></span>, and he was expelled from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>.[47] He then sought to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>rally</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Protest</b></span> the northern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnese</b></span> to his cause, at which the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> relented, and invited him back to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>.[44] By 491 BC though, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span> was widely considered insane and was sentenced to prison where he was found dead the following day.[44] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span> was succeeded by his half-brother <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>.[44]
<br>
<br>Taking advantage of the chaos in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, which effectively left <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> isolated, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> decided to launch an amphibious expedition to finally punish <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>.[48] An army was assembled in <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span>, and marched into <span style='color: blue'><b>Cilicia</b></span>, where a fleet had been gathered.[48] Command of the expedition was given to Datis the Mede and <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>, son of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>.
<br>
<br>According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, the fleet sent by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> consisted of 600 triremes.[49] There is no indication in the historical sources of how many transport ships accompanied them, if any. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> claimed that 3,000 transport ships accompanied 1,207 triremes during <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>'s invasion in 480 BC.[50] Among modern historians, some have accepted this number of ships as reasonable; it has been suggested either that the number 600 represents the combined number of triremes and transport ships,[51][52] or that there were <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>horse transports</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Horse_transports_in_the_Middle_Ages</b></span> in addition to 600 triremes.[53]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> does not estimate the size of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army, only saying that they formed a "large infantry that was well packed".[54] Among other ancient sources, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>poet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Poetry</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Simonides</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Simonides_of_Ceos</b></span>, a near-contemporary, says the campaign force numbered 200,000, while a later writer, the Roman <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cornelius Nepos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cornelius_Nepos</b></span> estimates 200,000 infantry and 10,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>.[55] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span> both independently give 300,000, as does the <span style='color: blue'><b>Suda</b></span> dictionary;[56][57][58] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plato</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Lysias</b></span> assert 500,000; and Justin 600,000.[59][60][61]
<br>
<br>Modern historians generally dismiss these numbers as exaggerations.[53] One approach to estimate the number of troops is to calculate the number of marines carried by 600 triremes. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> tells us that each <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>trireme</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Trireme</b></span> in the second invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> carried 30 extra marines, in addition to a probable 14 standard marines.[62] Thus, 600 triremes could easily have carried 18,000–26,000 infantry.[53][63] Numbers proposed for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> infantry are in the range 18,000–100,000.[51][52][64][65][66] However, the consensus is around 25,000.[53][65]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> infantry used in the invasion was probably a heterogeneous group drawn from across the empire. However, according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, there was at least a general conformity in the type of armour and style of fighting.[67] The troops were, generally speaking, armed with a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>bow</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bow_and_arrow</b></span>, 'short spear' and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sword</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sword</b></span>, carried a wicker shield, and wore at most a leather jerkin.[67][68] The one exception to this may have been the ethnic <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> troops, who may have worn a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>corslet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corslet</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>scale armour</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Scale_armour</b></span>.[67] Some contingents would have been armed somewhat differently;[67] for instance, the <span style='color: blue'><b>Saka</b></span> were renowned axemen.[69] The 'elite' contingents of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> infantry seem to have been the ethnic <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Medians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cissians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Khuzestan_Province</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue'><b>Saka</b></span>;[67] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> specifically mentions the presence of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Saka</b></span> at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>.[70] The style of fighting used by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> was probably to stand off from an enemy, using their bows (or equivalent) to wear down the enemy before closing in to deliver the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>coup de grace</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Coup_de_grâce</b></span> with spear and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sword</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sword</b></span>.[67]

<br>Estimates for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> are usually in the 1,000–3,000 range.[53][71] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> was usually provided by the ethnic <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bactrians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bactria</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cissians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Khuzestan_Province</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Saka</b></span>; most of these probably fought as lightly armed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>missile</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Missile</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>.[67][72] The fleet must have had at least some proportion of transport ships, since the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> was carried by ship; whilst <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> claims the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> was carried in the triremes, this is improbable. Lazenby estimates 30–40 transport ships would be required to carry 1,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>.[53]
<br>
<br>Once assembled, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> force sailed from <span style='color: blue'><b>Cilicia</b></span> firstly to the island of Rhodes. A Lindian Temple Chronicle records that Datis besieged the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lindos</b></span>, but was unsuccessful.[73]
<br>
<br>The fleet then moved north along the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> coast towards <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span>, before abruptly turning west into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean Sea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span>.[74] The fleet sailed next to <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>, in order to punish the Naxians for their resistance to the failed expedition that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> had mounted there a decade earlier.[74] Many of the inhabitants fled to the mountains; those that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> caught were enslaved.[75] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> then burnt the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> and temples of the Naxians.[75]
<br>
<br>Satellite image of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyclades</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Delos</b></span> is the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>small island</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Small_Island_(TV_film)</b></span> directly to the bottom-left of <span style='color: blue'><b>Mykonos</b></span>
<br>Moving on, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet approached <span style='color: blue'><b>Delos</b></span>, whereupon the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delos</b></span> also fled from their homes.[76] Having demonstrated <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> power at <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>, Datis now intended to show <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>clemency</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pardon</b></span> to the other islands, if they submitted to him.[74] He sent a herald to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delos</b></span>, proclaiming:
<br>
<br>"Holy men, why have you fled away, and so misjudged my intent? It is my own desire, and the king's command to me, to do no harm to the land where the two gods were born, neither to the land itself nor to its inhabitants. So return now to your homes and dwell on your island."[76]
<br>
<br>Datis then burned 300 talents of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>frankincense</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Frankincense</b></span> on the altar of <span style='color: blue'><b>Apollo</b></span> on <span style='color: blue'><b>Delos</b></span>, to show his respect for one of the gods of the island. The fleet then proceeded to island-hop across the rest of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> on its way to <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>, taking hostages and troops from each island.[74]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> finally arrived off the southern tip of <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span>, at <span style='color: blue'><b>Karystos</b></span>. The citizens of <span style='color: blue'><b>Karystos</b></span> refused to give hostages to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, so they were besieged, and their land ravaged, until they submitted to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[77]
<br>
<br>The task force then sailed around <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span> to the first major target, <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>.[78] According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, the Eretrians were divided amongst themselves as to the best course of action; whether to flee to the highlands, or undergo a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span>, or to submit to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[78] In the event, the majority decision was to remain in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>.[79] The Eretrians made no attempt to stop the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> landing, or advancing, and thus allowed themselves to be besieged.[79] For six days the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> attacked the walls, with losses on both sides;[79] however, on the seventh day two reputable Eretrians opened the gates and betrayed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[79] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> was razed, and temples and shrines were looted and burned. Furthermore, according to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>'s commands, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> enslaved all the remaining townspeople.[79]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet next headed south down the coast of <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>, landing at the bay of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, roughly 25 miles (40 km) from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, on the advice of <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span>, son of the former <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peisistratus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peisistratos</b></span>.[80] The Athenians, joined by a small force from <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>, marched to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, and succeeded in blocking the two exits from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Great_Plains</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>.[81] At the same time, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>' greatest runner, <span style='color: blue'><b>Pheidippides</b></span> (or Philippides) was sent to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> to request that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartan army</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> march to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>' aid.[81] <span style='color: blue'><b>Pheidippides</b></span> arrived during the festival of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Carneia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Carnea</b></span>, a sacrosanct period of peace, and was informed that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartan army</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> could not march to war until the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>full moon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Full_moon</b></span> rose; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> could not expect reinforcement for at least ten days.[82] They decided to hold out at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> for the time being, and they were reinforced by a contingent of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> from <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>.[81]
<br>
<br>Stalemate ensued for five days, before the Athenians (for reasons that are not completely clear) decided to attack the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[83] Despite the numerical advantage of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> proved devastatingly effective, routing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> wings before turning in on the centre of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> line; the remnants of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army left the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> and fled to their ships.[68] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> records that 6,400 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> bodies were counted on the battlefield;[84] the Athenians lost just 192 men[84] and the Plataeans 11.[85]
<br>
<br>In the immediate aftermath of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> says that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet sailed around Cape <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sunium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sounion</b></span> to attack <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> directly,[86] although some modern historians place this attempt just before the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>.[87] Either way, the Athenians evidently realised that their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> was still under threat, and marched as quickly as possible back to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>.[88] The Athenians arrived in time to prevent the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> from securing a landing, and seeing that the opportunity was lost, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> turned about and returned to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>.[88] On the next day, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartan army</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> arrived, having covered the 220 kilometers (140 mi) in only three days. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> toured the battlefield at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, and agreed that the Athenians had won a great victory.<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>[89</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Effects_of_Hurricane_Sandy_in_New_York</b></span>]
<br>
<br>The defeat at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> ended for the time being the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. However, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cycladic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyclades</b></span> islands had been resubjugated into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> empire, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span> reduced to a subordinate kingdom part of the empire; since the late 6th century BC they had been vassals of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, but remained having a broad scope of autonomy.[16] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> was still fully intent on conquering <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, to secure the western part of his empire.[90] Moreover, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> remained unpunished for its role in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>, and both <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> were unpunished for their treatment of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> ambassadors.[91]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> therefore began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>; however, in 486 BC, his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> expedition.[91] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> then died whilst preparing to march on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</b></span>, and the throne of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> passed to his son <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>.[92] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> crushed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemy_V_Epiphanes</b></span>, and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[93] This expedition was finally ready by 480 BC, and the second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> thereby began, under the command of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> himself.[94]
<br>
<br>For the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, the two expeditions to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> had been largely successful; new territories had been added to their empire and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> had been punished.[91] It was only a minor setback that the invasion had met defeat at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>; that defeat barely <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dented</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dented_Records</b></span> the enormous resources of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> empire.[95] Yet, for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, it was an enormously significant victory. It was the first time that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> had beaten the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, and showed them that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were not invincible, and that resistance, rather than subjugation, was possible.[96]
<br>
<br>The victory at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> was a defining moment for the young <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span>, showing what might be achieved through unity and self-belief; indeed, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> effectively marks the start of a 'golden age' for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>.[97] This was also applicable to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> as a whole; "their victory endowed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> with a faith in their destiny that was to endure for three centuries, during which western culture was born".[3][98] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>John Stuart Mill</span> <span style='color: green'><b>John_Stuart_Mill</b></span>'s famous opinion was that "the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, even as an event in British history, is more important than the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Hastings</b></span>".[99]

<br>Militarily, a major lesson for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> was the potential of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span>.
