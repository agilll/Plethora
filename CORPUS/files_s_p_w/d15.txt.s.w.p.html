<br>With defeat at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a>, the inconclusive <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naval_warfare?lang=en'>Naval_warfare</a> at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artemisium?lang=en'>Artemisium</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a>’ <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> army on the rampage, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> city-states faced an unprecedented attack, one which threatened their very existence. The tide would turn, though, in September 480 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>Common_Era</a> at the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Battle_of_Salamis</a> in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saronic_Gulf?lang=en'>Saronic_Gulf</a>, a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naval_warfare?lang=en'>Naval_warfare</a> which would rank as one of the greatest and most significant in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>. Overcoming superior numbers with daring tactics and sheer determination, the allied <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> forces won a freedom which would allow a never-before-seen period of artistic and cultural <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/HMS_Endeavour?lang=en'>HMS_Endeavour</a> which would form the foundations of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Western_world?lang=en'>Western_world</a> for millennia. 
<br>
<br>By the first years of the 5th century <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>Common_Era</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>, under the rule of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a> (r. 522-486 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>Common_Era</a>), was already expanding into mainland <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe?lang=en'>Europe</a> and had subjugated <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrace?lang=en'>Thrace</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Republic_of_Macedonia?lang=en'>Republic_of_Macedonia</a>. The next objective was to quell once and for all the collection of potentially troublesome rebel states on the western border of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire?lang=en'>Roman_Empire</a>. In 490 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>Common_Era</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> forces led by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> met the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a> at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Battle_of_Marathon</a> and defeated the invaders. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a> would take on mythical status amongst the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>, but in reality it was merely the opening <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Overture?lang=en'>Overture</a> of a long war with several other battles making up the principal acts. In 486 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>Common_Era</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a> became king, and he invaded first the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyclades?lang=en'>Cyclades</a> and then the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> mainland after victory at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> in August 480 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>Common_Era</a> against a token <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> force. At the indecisive <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naval_warfare?lang=en'>Naval_warfare</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artemisium?lang=en'>Artemisium</a> (also in August 480 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>Common_Era</a>), the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> held off the superior numbers of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> fleet but were obliged to regroup at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Battle_of_Salamis</a>.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> then, lay open to the invaders and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> forces rampaged through the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polis?lang=en'>Polis</a> or city-states, sacking even <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> itself. Some 30 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polis?lang=en'>Polis</a>, however, were preparing to fight back and the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Battle_of_Salamis</a> would show <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a> that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>, or at least a large chunk of it, was far from being conquered.  
<br>
<br>The vast Persian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire?lang=en'>Roman_Empire</a> stretched from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Danube?lang=en'>Danube</a> to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ptolemaic_Kingdom?lang=en'>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</a> and from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a> to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bactria?lang=en'>Bactria</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a> was able to draw on a huge <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Military_reserve?lang=en'>Military_reserve</a> of resources to amass a huge invasion force. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ariabignes?lang=en'>Ariabignes</a>, the son of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a>, commanded the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carians?lang=en'>Carians</a>, Achaimene, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a> fleets. Cybernis, the king of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xanthos?lang=en'>Xanthos</a>, led the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lycia?lang=en'>Lycia</a> fleet of 50 ships. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artemisia_I_of_Caria?lang=en'>Artemisia_I_of_Caria</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tyrant?lang=en'>Tyrant</a> of Halicarnassus, led the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dorians?lang=en'>Dorians</a> fleet of 30 ships and other known commanders included Prexaspes, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Megabazus?lang=en'>Megabazus</a>, and Achaimenes. Technically, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>, and especially the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phoenicia?lang=en'>Phoenicia</a>, were better seamen, but as the fleet was drawn from all parts of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire?lang=en'>Roman_Empire</a>, the motivation and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Communication?lang=en'>Communication</a> levels were perhaps less than their opponents who all spoke the same language and who were fighting not only for their own survival but that of their families and their way of life.
<br>
<br>The exact number of ships in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> fleet is not known. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> in his <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> (440-430 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>Common_Era</a>) compiles precise lists but these are widely thought to be exaggerated and unreliable. Also, his list is for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> fleet which originally sailed to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> waters and by the time of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Battle_of_Salamis</a>, many would have been left to guard ports and supply routes or have been lost in storms (especially at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magnesia_Prefecture?lang=en'>Magnesia_Prefecture</a>) and in the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artemisium?lang=en'>Artemisium</a> a month earlier. Nevertheless, below are his figures for triremes  - warships with three banks of oars (note the contributions from conquered or pro-Persian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> cities):
<br>
<br>An alternative source - the writer of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theatre_of_ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Theatre_of_ancient_Greece</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aeschylus?lang=en'>Aeschylus</a> - does seem to support <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> in his <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Persians?lang=en'>The_Persians</a> (472 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>Common_Era</a>)  where he states that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> fleet had 1,207 ships compared to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> force of only 310. Accounting for losses incurred in the manner described above it is estimated that perhaps around 500 triremes faced the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Battle_of_Salamis</a> but there is no scholarly consensus on even an approximate figure. There would also have been many smaller ships such as penteconters (50 oars) and triaconters (30 oars) but <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>’ figure of 3000 seems wildly exaggerated.
<br>
<br>The allied <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> fleet was commanded by the Spartan <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eurybiades?lang=en'>Eurybiades</a>, a surprising choice considering it was <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> who was the great naval power and supplied by far the most ships. The two other senior commanders were <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adeimantus_of_Corinth?lang=en'>Adeimantus_of_Corinth</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a>. In effect, tactics and strategy were decided by a council of 17 commanders from each of the contributing contingents. However, it is <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>, the brilliant naval commander, drawing on his twenty-year experience and flush from the success of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artemisium?lang=en'>Artemisium</a> against far superior numbers, who is widely credited with deciding to hold position at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Battle_of_Salamis</a> instead of retreating to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isthmus_of_Corinth?lang=en'>Isthmus_of_Corinth</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a> and masterminding the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> victory.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>’ figures are once again inconsistent, his grand total of 380 triremes making up the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> fleet is 15 more than the sum of his individual state contributions:
<br>
<br>The figures for some states are suspiciously similar to those given before the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artemisium?lang=en'>Artemisium</a>, implausibly suggesting either they suffered next to no losses in that conflict or a swift replacement of vessels. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aeschylus?lang=en'>Aeschylus</a> states a total figure of 310 and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> 400. In summary, we can only say that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> fleet seems to have significantly outnumbered the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>.
<br>
<br>Both sides had very similar ships - the triremes (triērēis) - which were 40-50 ton wooden warships up to 40 m long. Light, streamlined, and manoeuvrable, they were powered in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a> by 170 oarsmen split in three ranks down each side of the ship. Able to rapidly accelerate, break, zigzag, and turn 360 degrees in just two ships’ <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse?lang=en'>Horse</a>, good seamanship could place the vessel to best advantage and employ the principal strategy of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naval_warfare?lang=en'>Naval_warfare</a> at that time which was to ram the enemy, making full use of the bronze ram fitted to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prow?lang=en'>Prow</a> of the vessel. Triremes also carried a small complement of  soldiers, at least 10 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> and four archers. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Persians?lang=en'>The_Persians</a> generally carried more - 14 combatants and 30 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> armed with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bow_and_arrow?lang=en'>Bow_and_arrow</a>, spear, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sword?lang=en'>Sword</a>. These extra troops came into their own when at close quarters with the enemy and in the case of boarding an enemy vessel. 
<br>
<br>Triremes had a weakness in that they could only operate effectively in relatively calm seas with waves less than 1 m high; otherwise, water would enter via the oar-ports and flood the ship. Also, they had to stay close to shore as each night they needed to be beached if the light <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wood?lang=en'>Wood</a> was not to become water-logged, significantly reducing the speed performance of the vessel. In addition, there was very little space on board for provisions and no room to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sleep?lang=en'>Sleep</a> so the crews had no choice but to land each night. Prior to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a> the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> ships were beached at several bays on the island of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Battle_of_Salamis</a> from Cynosoura to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Salamis_Island?lang=en'>Salamis_Island</a>. Here too were much of the evacuated populace of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attica?lang=en'>Attica</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Persians?lang=en'>The_Persians</a>, meanwhile, were stationed at the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalerum?lang=en'>Phalerum</a>, less than 10 km away across the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saronic_Gulf?lang=en'>Saronic_Gulf</a> and close to the captured <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piraeus?lang=en'>Piraeus</a>.
<br>
<br>Commanders led from the front and each would have been on his own ship at the heart of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a>. From there, manoeuvres could be signalled to other ships in the fleet using flags and trumpets. However, once the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a> got fully underway, naval conflicts became a case of a single ship against a single opponent rather than precisely coordinated manoeuvres.
<br>
<br>Prior to full engagement between the opposing fleets, there were two principal strategies employed by the more able commanders. The first was sailing around the enemy line (periplous) and the second was smashing through gaps in the enemy line and attacking from their rear flank (diekplous). Both were designed to get one’s ship in a position to ram the weakest point of the enemy - the side or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stern?lang=en'>Stern</a> quarter. The objective was to puncture a hole in the enemy vessel or break a sufficient number of their oars to disable the ship. To avoid damaging one’s own oars, crews were drilled to withdraw them in a matter of seconds (usually on only one side of the ship whilst the other side maintained the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Momentum?lang=en'>Momentum</a> of the vessel). As a defence against these two tactics, an able commander would ensure one of his flanks was closed off by shallows or coastline and ensure his crews were sufficiently drilled to maintain close order. In open water the ships could be organised in a defensive <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Circle?lang=en'>Circle</a> or an arc (more practical with larger fleets) with prows pointing outwards (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kyklos?lang=en'>Kyklos</a>).
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Actual_(band)?lang=en'>The_Actual_(band)</a> details of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a> are sketchy and often contradictory between ancient sources. Nevertheless, presenting the most commonly agreed upon elements, the first action of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a> was the defection of two <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a> ships to the allied <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> fleet. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>, perhaps sending messages to the pro-Persian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> state fleets, had hoped for more such defections but no others occurred. One such ship from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tinos?lang=en'>Tinos</a> informed the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> were amassing in the straits, blocking in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> fleet. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Persians?lang=en'>The_Persians</a> had moved into position overnight, hoping to surprise the enemy, but this strategy was unlikely to be successful considering the short distances involved and the noise made by the rowers. There is also the possibility that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> had sent messages to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a> intimating the fragile <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> alliance was breaking up and the fleet was about to retreat.
<br>
<br>Probably, the two fleets aligned along an oblique east-west axis with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> close to the mainland shore with both fleets having a friendly shore behind them. Indeed, proximity to the opposite mainland shore would have been avoided by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> ships due to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a>’ positioning there of a contingent of his archers. On the western (right) wing the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phoenicia?lang=en'>Phoenicia</a> faced the Athenians and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionians?lang=en'>Ionians</a> against the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a>. On the left flank of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> were the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carians?lang=en'>Carians</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dorians?lang=en'>Dorians</a>. Behind the main <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> line, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegina?lang=en'>Aegina</a> contingent and some of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> ships waited in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Military_reserve?lang=en'>Military_reserve</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Corinth?lang=en'>Ancient_Corinth</a> were stationed to the west of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a> lines protecting the passage to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eleusis?lang=en'>Eleusis</a> whilst the pro-Persian Cyprians, Cilicians, and Hellespontines held back to the south, guarding the exit to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piraeus?lang=en'>Piraeus</a>. According to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diodorus_Siculus?lang=en'>Diodorus_Siculus</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a> sent his <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a> fleet to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pinniped?lang=en'>Pinniped</a> off the straits between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Battle_of_Salamis</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Megara?lang=en'>Megara</a> and engage any <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> ships breaking off from the main fleet.
<br>
<br>Overlooking from his command post in the early morning, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a> would have seen not a fleet about to retreat but the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> positioned two-ships deep along a 3 km long curve, perhaps presenting a line of 130 ships against the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> main front of 150 ships, three ships deep. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Persians?lang=en'>The_Persians</a> advanced, becoming more closely packed as they aligned themselves with the enemy’s narrower front. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> held position, drawing the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> into an ever tighter <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Confine?lang=en'>Confine</a>. Ships began to ram each other and in the tight space they would have struggled to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Disengage_(album)?lang=en'>Disengage_(album)</a>. Then the armed soldiers on board would have come into their own with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> and archers fighting on the decks much as in a land <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a>. With more <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> ships pressing in from the rear and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Corinth?lang=en'>Ancient_Corinth</a> joining from the side, there must have been a chaos of broken ships and drowning men - particularly amongst the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> who had no shore to retreat to and most probably could not swim.
<br>
<br>With more space to manoeuvre, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> ships were able to pick off the closely packed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> vessels which could not retreat because their lines were now several ships deep. By the afternoon, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> victory was assured and the remaining <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> ships retreated to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a>. The final stage of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a> was the transferral of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> force on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Battle_of_Salamis</a> over to the mainland which then made short work of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> land forces. 
<br>
<br>Once again the cryptic <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delphi?lang=en'>Delphi</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo?lang=en'>Apollo</a> at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delphi?lang=en'>Delphi</a> had been proved right: ‘only a wooden wall will keep you safe’. As at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artemisium?lang=en'>Artemisium</a>, the wooden ships of the combined <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> fleet had, for a second time, rebuffed the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> advance.
<br>
<br>Following defeat, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a> returned home to his palace at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Philip_Sousa?lang=en'>John_Philip_Sousa</a> and left the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Child_prodigy?lang=en'>Child_prodigy</a> general <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mardonius?lang=en'>Mardonius</a> in charge of the invasion. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> position was still strong despite the defeat - they still controlled much of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> and their large land army was intact. After a series of political negotiations, it became clear that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> would not gain victory on land through diplomacy and the two opposing armies met at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Plataea?lang=en'>Battle_of_Plataea</a> in August 479 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>Common_Era</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>, fielding the largest <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> army ever seen, won the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a> and finally ended <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a>’ ambitions in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>
