<span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> (/θjuːˈsɪdɪdiːz/; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>: Θουκυδίδης Thoukydídēs [tʰuːkydídɛːs]; c. 460 – c. 400 BC) was an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> historian and general. His History of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> recounts the fifth-century BC war between <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> until the year 411 BC. <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> has been dubbed the father of "scientific history" by those who accept his claims to have applied strict standards of impartiality and evidence-gathering and analysis of cause and effect, without reference to intervention by the deities, as outlined in his introduction to his work.[1][2]
<br>
<br>He also has been called the father of the school of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>political realism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Realism_(international_relations)</b></span>, which views the political behavior of individuals and the subsequent outcomes of relations between states as ultimately mediated by and constructed upon the emotions of fear and self-interest.[3] His text is still studied at universities and military colleges worldwide.[4] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Melian dialogue</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege_of_Melos</b></span> is regarded as a seminal work of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>international</span> <span style='color: green'><b>International_law</b></span> relations theory, while his version of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pericles' Funeral Oration</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pericles'_Funeral_Oration</b></span> is widely studied by political theorists, historians, and students of the classics.
<br>
<br>More generally, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> developed an understanding of human nature to explain behaviour in such crises as plagues, massacres, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>civil war</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Civil_war</b></span>.
<br>
<br>In spite of his stature as a historian, modern historians know relatively little about <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s life. The most reliable information comes from his own History of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span>, which expounds his nationality, paternity, and native <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>locality</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Principle_of_locality</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>informs</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Institute_for_Operations_Research_and_the_Management_Sciences</b></span> us that he fought in the war, contracted the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plague</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Black_Death</b></span>, and was exiled by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span>. He may have also been involved in quelling the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Samian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Samos</b></span> Revolt.[5]
<br>
<br>Evidence from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Classical period</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_antiquity</b></span>[edit]
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> identifies himself as an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, telling us that his father's name was <span style='color: blue'><b>Olorus</b></span> and that he was from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>deme</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Deme</b></span> of Halimous.[6] He survived the Plague of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>,[7] which killed <span style='color: blue'><b>Pericles</b></span> and many other Athenians. He also records that he owned gold mines at Scapte <span style='color: blue'><b>Hyle</b></span> (literally "Dug Woodland"), a coastal area in <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span>, opposite the island of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thasos</b></span>.[8]
<br>
<br>Because of his influence in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thracian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thrace</b></span> region, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> wrote, he was sent as a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>strategos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Strategos</b></span> (general) to <span style='color: blue'><b>Thasos</b></span> in 424 BC. During the winter of 424–423 BC, the Spartan general <span style='color: blue'><b>Brasidas</b></span> attacked <span style='color: blue'><b>Amphipolis</b></span>, a half-day's sail west from <span style='color: blue'><b>Thasos</b></span> on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thracian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thrace</b></span> coast, instigating the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Amphipolis</b></span>. Eucles, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> commander at <span style='color: blue'><b>Amphipolis</b></span>, sent to <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> for help.[9] <span style='color: blue'><b>Brasidas</b></span>, aware the presence of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> on <span style='color: blue'><b>Thasos</b></span> and his influence with the people of <span style='color: blue'><b>Amphipolis</b></span>, and afraid of help arriving by sea, acted quickly to offer moderate terms to the Amphipolitans for their surrender, which they accepted. Thus, when <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> arrived, <span style='color: blue'><b>Amphipolis</b></span> was already under Spartan control.[10]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Amphipolis</b></span> was of considerable strategic importance, and news of its fall caused great consternation in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>.[11] It was blamed on <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>, although he claimed that it was not his fault and that he had simply been unable to reach it in time. Because of his failure to save <span style='color: blue'><b>Amphipolis</b></span>, he was exiled:[12]
<br>
<br>I lived through the whole of it, being of an age to comprehend events, and giving my attention to them in order to know the exact truth about them. It was also my fate to be an exile from my country for twenty years after my command at <span style='color: blue'><b>Amphipolis</b></span>; and being present with both parties, and more especially with the Peloponnesians by reason of my exile, I had leisure to observe affairs somewhat particularly.
<br>
<br>Using his status as an exile from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> to travel freely among the Peloponnesian allies, he was able to view the war from the perspective of both sides. <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> claimed that he began writing his history as soon as the war broke out, because he thought it would be one of the greatest wars waged among the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> in terms of scale:
<br>
<br>"<span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>, an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, wrote the history of the war between the Peloponnesians and the Athenians, beginning at the moment that it broke out, and believing that it would be a great war, and more worthy of relation than any that had preceded it."[13]
<br>
<br>This is all that <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> wrote about his own life, but a few other facts are available from reliable contemporary sources. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> wrote that the name <span style='color: blue'><b>Olorus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s father's name, was connected with <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thracian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thrace</b></span> royalty.[14] <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> was probably connected through family to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>statesman</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Winston_Churchill</b></span> and general <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> and his son <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span>, leaders of the old aristocracy supplanted by the Radical Democrats. <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span>'s maternal grandfather's name also was <span style='color: blue'><b>Olorus</b></span>, making the connection exceedingly likely. Another <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> lived before the historian and was also linked with <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span>, making a family connection between them very likely as well. Finally, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> confirms the connection of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s family with the mines at Scapté Hýlē.[15]
<br>
<br>Combining all the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>fragmentary evidence</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Fragmentary_Evidence</b></span> available, it seems that his family had owned a large estate in <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span>, one that even contained gold mines, and which allowed the family considerable and lasting affluence. The security and continued prosperity of the wealthy estate must have necessitated formal ties with local kings or chieftains, which explains the adoption of the distinctly <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thracian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thrace</b></span> royal name Óloros into the family. Once exiled, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> took permanent residence in the estate and, given his ample income from the gold mines, he was able to dedicate himself to full-time history writing and research, including many fact-finding trips. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>In essence</span> <span style='color: green'><b>In_Essence</b></span>, he was a well-connected gentleman of considerable resources who, after involuntarily retiring from the political and military spheres, decided to fund his own historical investigations.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The remaining</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Remaining</b></span> evidence for <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s life comes from rather less reliable, later ancient sources. According to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span>, someone named Oenobius was able to get a law passed allowing <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> to return to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, presumably sometime shortly after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>'s surrender and the end of the war in 404 BC.[16] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span> goes on to say that <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> was murdered on his way back to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>. Many doubt this account, seeing evidence to suggest he lived as late as 397 BC. <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> claims that his remains were returned to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and placed in <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span>'s family <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vault</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bank_vault</b></span>.[17]
<br>
<br>The abrupt end to <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s narrative, which breaks off in the middle of the year 411 BC, has traditionally been interpreted that he died while writing the book, although other explanations have been put forward.
<br>
<br>Inferences about <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s character can only be drawn (with due caution) from his book. His sardonic sense of humour is evident throughout, as when, during his description of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plague</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Black_Death</b></span>, he remarks that old Athenians seemed to remember a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>rhyme</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Rhyme</b></span> which said that with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dorian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dorians</b></span> War would come a "great death". Some claimed that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>rhyme</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Rhyme</b></span> originally mentioned a [death by] "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>famine</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Famine</b></span>" or "starvation" (λιμός, limos[18]), and was only remembered later as [death by] "pestilence" (λοιμός, loimos[19]) due to the current <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plague</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Black_Death</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> then remarks that should another <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dorian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dorians</b></span> War come, this time attended with a great dearth, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>rhyme</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Rhyme</b></span> will be remembered as "dearth," and any mention of "death" forgotten.[20]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> admired <span style='color: blue'><b>Pericles</b></span>, approving of his power over the people and showing a marked distaste for the demagogues who followed him. He did not approve of the democratic commoners nor the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>radical democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Radical_democracy</b></span> that <span style='color: blue'><b>Pericles</b></span> ushered in, but considered <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span> acceptable when guided by a good leader.[21] <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s presentation of events is generally even-handed; for example, he does not minimize the negative effect of his own failure at <span style='color: blue'><b>Amphipolis</b></span>. Occasionally, however, strong passions break through, as in his scathing appraisals of the democratic leaders <span style='color: blue'><b>Cleon</b></span>[22][23] and <span style='color: blue'><b>Hyperbolus</b></span>.[24] Sometimes, <span style='color: blue'><b>Cleon</b></span> has been connected with <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s exile.[25]
<br>
<br>It has been argued that <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> was moved by the suffering inherent in war and concerned about the excesses to which human nature is prone in such circumstances, as in his analysis of the atrocities committed during the civil conflict on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corcyra</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corfu</b></span>,[26] which includes the phrase "war is a violent teacher" (πόλεμος βίαιος διδάσκαλος).
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> believed that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> represented an event of unmatched importance.[27] As such, he began to write the History at the onset of the war in 431.[28][29] His intention was to write an account which would serve as "a possession for all time".[30] The history breaks off near the end of the twenty-first year of the war and does not elaborate on the final conflicts of the war. This facet of the work suggests that <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> died whilst writing his history and more so, that his death was unexpected.
<br>
<br>After his death, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s History was subdivided into eight books: its modern title is the History of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span>. His great contribution to history and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>historiography</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Historiography</b></span> is contained in this one dense history of the 27-year war between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, each alongside their respective allies. This subdivision was most likely made by librarians and archivists, themselves being historians and scholars, most likely working in the Library of <span style='color: blue'><b>Alexandria</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The History of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> continued to be modified well beyond the end of the war in 404, as exemplified by a reference at Book I.1.13[31] to the conclusion of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> (404 BC), seven years after the last events in the main text of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>' history.[32]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> is generally regarded as one of the first true historians. Like his predecessor <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, known as "the father of history", <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> places a high value on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>eyewitness testimony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Eyewitness_testimony</b></span> and writes about events in which he probably took part. He also assiduously consulted written documents and interviewed participants about the events that he recorded. Unlike <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, whose stories often teach that a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hubris</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hubris</b></span> invites the wrath of the deities, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> does not acknowledge divine intervention in human affairs.[33]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> exerted wide <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>historiographical</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Historiography</b></span> influence on subsequent <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenistic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hellenistic_period</b></span> and Roman historians, although the exact description of his style in relation to many successive historians remains unclear.[34] Readers in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>antiquity</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> often placed the continuation of the stylistic legacy of the History in the writings of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>' putative intellectual successor <span style='color: blue'><b>Xenophon</b></span>. Such readings often described <span style='color: blue'><b>Xenophon</b></span>'s treatises as attempts to "finish" <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s History. Many of these interpretations, however, have garnered significant scepticism among modern scholars, such as Dillery, who <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>spurn</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spurn</b></span> the view of interpreting <span style='color: blue'><b>Xenophon</b></span> qua <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>, arguing that the latter's "modern" history (defined as constructed based on literary and historical themes) is antithetical to the former's account in the <span style='color: blue'><b>Hellenica</b></span>, which diverges from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>historiographical</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Historiography</b></span> tradition in its absence of a preface or introduction to the text and the associated lack of an "overarching concept" unifying the history.[35]
<br>
<br>A noteworthy difference between <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s method of writing history and that of modern historians is <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s inclusion of lengthy formal speeches that, as he states, were literary reconstructions rather than quotations of what was said—or, perhaps, what he believed ought to have been said. Arguably, had he not done this, the gist of what was said would not otherwise be known at all—whereas today there is a plethora of documentation—written records, archives, and recording technology for historians to consult. Therefore, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s method served to rescue his mostly oral sources from oblivion. We do not know how these historical figures spoke. <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s recreation uses a heroic stylistic register. A celebrated example is <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pericles' funeral oration</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pericles'_Funeral_Oration</b></span>, which heaps honour on the dead and includes a defence of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span>:
<br>
<br>The whole earth is the sepulchre of famous men; they are honoured not only by columns and inscriptions in their own land, but in foreign nations on memorials graven not on stone but in the hearts and minds of men. (2:43)
<br>
<br>Stylistically, the placement of this passage also serves to heighten the contrast with the description of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plague</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Black_Death</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> immediately following it, which graphically emphasizes the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>horror</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Horror_fiction</b></span> of human <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mortality</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Death</b></span>, thereby conveying a powerful sense of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>verisimilitude</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Verisimilitude</b></span>:
<br>
<br>Though many lay unburied, birds and beasts would not touch them, or died after tasting them [...]. The bodies of dying men lay one upon another, and half-dead creatures reeled about the streets and gathered round all the fountains in their longing for water. The sacred places also in which they had quartered themselves were full of corpses of persons who had died there, just as they were; for, as the disaster passed all bounds, men, not knowing what was to become of them, became equally contemptuous of the property of and the dues to the deities. All the burial rites before in use were entirely upset, and they buried the bodies as best they could. Many from want of the proper appliances, through so many of their friends having died already, had recourse to the most <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>shameless</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Shameless_(UK_TV_series)</b></span> sepultures: sometimes getting the start of those who had raised a pile, they threw their own dead body upon the stranger's <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pyre</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pyre</b></span> and ignited it; sometimes they tossed the corpse which they were carrying on the top of another that was burning, and so went off. (2:52)
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> omits discussion of the arts, literature, or the social milieu in which the events in his book take place and in which he grew up. He saw himself as recording an event, not a period, and went to considerable <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>lengths</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Horse</b></span> to exclude what he deemed frivolous or extraneous.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Paul Shorey</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Paul_Shorey</b></span> calls <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> "a cynic devoid of moral sensibility".[36] In addition, he notes that <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> conceived of human nature as strictly determined by one's physical and social environments, alongside basic desires.[37]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>' work indicates an influence from the teachings of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sophists</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sophist</b></span> that contributes substantially to the thinking and character of his History.[38] Possible evidence includes his skeptical ideas concerning justice and morality.[39] There are also elements within the History—such as his views on nature revolving around the factual, empirical, and the non-anthropomorphic—which suggest that he was at least aware of the views of philosophers such as <span style='color: blue'><b>Anaxagoras</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Democritus</b></span>. There is also evidence of his knowledge concerning some of the corpus of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hippocratic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hippocrates</b></span> medical writings.[40]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> was especially interested in the relationship between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>human intelligence</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Intelligence</b></span> and judgment,[41] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Fortune</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Fortuna</b></span> and Necessity,[42] and the idea that history is too irrational and incalculable to predict.[43]

<br>Scholars traditionally view <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> as recognizing and teaching the lesson that democracies need leadership, but that leadership can be dangerous to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leo Strauss</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leo_Strauss</b></span> (in The City and Man) locates the problem in the nature of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span> itself, about which, he argued, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> had a deeply ambivalent view: on one hand, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s own "wisdom was made possible" by the Periclean <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span>, which had the effect of liberating individual daring, enterprise, and questioning spirit; but this same liberation, by permitting the growth of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>limitless</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Limitless_(film)</b></span> political ambition, led to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>imperialism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Imperialism</b></span> and, eventually, civic strife.[44]

<br>For <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Canadian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Canadians</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Charles</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Charles_I_of_England</b></span> Norris Cochrane (1889–1945), <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s fastidious devotion to observable phenomena, focus on cause and effect, and strict exclusion of other factors anticipates twentieth-century scientific <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>positivism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Positivism</b></span>. Cochrane, the son of a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>physician</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Physician</b></span>, speculated that <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> generally (and especially in describing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plague</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Black_Death</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>) was influenced by the methods and thinking of early medical writers such as <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippocrates</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Kos</b></span>.[45]
<br>
<br>After <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>World War II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>World_War_II</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>classical</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_antiquity</b></span> scholar <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Jacqueline de Romilly</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Jacqueline_de_Romilly</b></span> pointed out that the problem of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>imperialism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Imperialism</b></span> was one of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s central <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>preoccupations</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Preoccupations</b></span> and situated his history in the context of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> thinking about <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>international</span> <span style='color: green'><b>International_law</b></span> politics. Since the appearance of her study, other scholars further examined <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s treatment of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>realpolitik</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Realpolitik</b></span>.
<br>
<br>More recently, scholars have questioned the perception of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> as simply, "the father of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>realpolitik</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Realpolitik</b></span>". Instead they have brought to the fore the literary qualities of the History, which they see as belonging to the narrative tradition of <span style='color: blue'><b>Homer</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Hesiod</b></span> and as concerned with the concepts of justice and suffering found in <span style='color: blue'><b>Plato</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristotle</b></span> and problematized in <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeschylus</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sophocles</b></span>.[46] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Richard Ned Lebow</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Richard_Ned_Lebow</b></span> terms <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> "the last of the tragedians", stating that "<span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> drew heavily on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>epic poetry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Epic_poetry</b></span> and tragedy to construct his history, which not surprisingly is also constructed as a narrative."[47] In this view, the blind and immoderate behaviour of the Athenians (and indeed of all the other actors) – although perhaps intrinsic to human nature – ultimately leads to their downfall. Thus his History could serve as a warning to future leaders to be more prudent, by putting them on notice that someone would be scrutinizing their actions with a historian's objectivity rather than a chronicler's flattery.[48]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The historian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Historian</b></span> J. B. <span style='color: blue'><b>Bury</b></span> writes that the work of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> "marks the longest and most decisive step that has ever been taken by a single man towards making history what it is today."[49]
<br>
<br>Historian H. D. Kitto feels that <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> wrote about the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span>, not because it was the most significant war in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>antiquity</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, but because it caused the most suffering. Indeed, several passages of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s book are written "with an intensity of feeling hardly exceeded by <span style='color: blue'><b>Sappho</b></span> herself."[50]
<br>
<br>In his Open Society and Its Enemies, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Karl Popper</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Karl_Popper</b></span> writes that <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> was the "greatest historian, perhaps, who ever lived." <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s work, however, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Popper</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Karl_Popper</b></span> goes on to say, represents "an interpretation, a point of view; and in this we need not agree with him." In the war between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span> and the "arrested <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oligarchic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Oligarchy</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tribalism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tribalism</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>," we must never forget <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s "involuntary bias," and that "his heart was not with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, his native <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>:"
<br>
<br>"Although he apparently did not belong to the extreme wing of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oligarchic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Oligarchy</b></span> clubs who conspired throughout the war with the enemy, he was certainly a member of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oligarchic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Oligarchy</b></span> party, and a friend neither of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> people, the demos, who had exiled him, nor of its <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>imperialist</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Imperialism</b></span> policy."[51]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> and his immediate predecessor, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, both exerted a significant influence on Western <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>historiography</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Historiography</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> does not mention his counterpart by name, but his famous introductory statement is thought to refer to him:[52][53]
<br>
<br>To hear this history rehearsed, for that there be inserted in it no fables, shall be perhaps not delightful. But he that desires to look into the truth of things done, and which (according to the condition of humanity) may be done again, or at least their like, shall find enough herein to make him think it profitable. And it is compiled rather for an everlasting possession than to be rehearsed for a prize. (1:22)
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> records in his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span> not only the events of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, but also geographical and ethnographical information, as well as the fables related to him during his extensive travels. Typically, he passes no definitive judgment on what he has heard. In the case of conflicting or unlikely accounts, he presents both sides, says what he believes and then invites readers to decide for themselves.[54] The work of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> is reported to have been recited at festivals, where prizes were awarded, as for example, during the games at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Opel_Olympia</b></span>.[55]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> views history as a source of moral lessons, with conflicts and wars as misfortunes flowing from initial acts of injustice perpetuated through cycles of revenge.[56] In contrast, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> claims to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>confine</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Confine</b></span> himself to factual reports of contemporary political and military events, based on unambiguous, first-hand, eye-witness accounts,[57] although, unlike <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, he does not reveal his sources. <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> views life exclusively as political life, and history in terms of political history. Conventional moral considerations play no role in his analysis of political events while geographic and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ethnographic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ethnography</b></span> aspects are omitted or, at best, of secondary importance. Subsequent <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historians—such as <span style='color: blue'><b>Ctesias</b></span>, Diodorus, <span style='color: blue'><b>Strabo</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Polybius</b></span> and Plutarch—held up <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s writings as a model of truthful history. <span style='color: blue'><b>Lucian</b></span>[58] refers to <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> as having given <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historians their law, requiring them to say what had been done (ὡς ἐπράχθη). <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historians of the fourth century BC accepted that history was political and that contemporary history was the proper domain of a historian.[59] <span style='color: blue'><b>Cicero</b></span> calls <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> the "father of history;"[60] yet the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> writer <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>, in his <span style='color: blue'><b>Moralia</b></span> (Ethics) denigrated <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, notably calling him a philobarbaros, a "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>barbarian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Barbarian</b></span> lover', to the detriment of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[61] Unlike <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>, however, these authors all continued to view history as a source of moral lessons.
<br>
<br>Due to the loss of the ability to read <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> were largely forgotten during the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Middle Ages</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Middle_Ages</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Western Europe</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Western_world</b></span>, although their influence continued in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Byzantine</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Byzantium</b></span> world. In <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> become known and highly respected only in the late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth century as an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ethnographer</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ethnography</b></span>, in part due to the discovery of America, where customs and animals were encountered that were even more surprising than what he had related. During the Reformation, moreover, information about Middle Eastern countries in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span> provided a basis for establishing <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Biblical chronology</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chronology_of_the_Bible</b></span> as advocated by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Isaac Newton</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Isaac_Newton</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The first European translation of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> (into <span style='color: blue'><b>Latin</b></span>) was made by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>humanist</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Humanism</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lorenzo Valla</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lorenzo_Valla</b></span> between 1448 and 1452, and the first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> edition was published by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aldo Manuzio</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aldus_Manutius</b></span> in 1502. During the <span style='color: blue'><b>Renaissance</b></span>, however, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> attracted less interest among Western European historians as a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>political philosopher</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Political_philosophy</b></span> than his successor, <span style='color: blue'><b>Polybius</b></span>,[62] although <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Poggio Bracciolini</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Poggio_Bracciolini</b></span> claimed to have been influenced by him. There is not much evidence of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s influence in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Niccolò Machiavelli</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Niccolò_Machiavelli</b></span>'s <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Prince</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Prince</b></span> (1513), which held that the chief aim of a new prince must be to "maintain his state" [i.e., his power] and that in so doing he is often compelled to act against faith, humanity, and religion. Later historians, such as J. B. <span style='color: blue'><b>Bury</b></span>, however, have noted parallels between them:
<br>
<br>If, instead of a history, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> had written an analytical treatise on politics, with particular reference to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>, it is probable that ... he could have forestalled <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Machiavelli</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Merchant_Prince</b></span>... [since] the whole <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>innuendo</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Innuendo</b></span> of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thucydidean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thucydides</b></span> treatment of history agrees with the fundamental postulate of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Machiavelli</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Merchant_Prince</b></span>, the supremacy of reason of state. To maintain a state said the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Florentine</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Florence</b></span> thinker, "a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>statesman</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Winston_Churchill</b></span> is often compelled to act against faith, humanity and religion." ... But ... the true <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Machiavelli</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Merchant_Prince</b></span>, not the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Machiavelli</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Merchant_Prince</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>fable</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Fable</b></span> ... entertained an ideal: <span style='color: blue'><b>Italy</b></span> for the Italians, <span style='color: blue'><b>Italy</b></span> freed from the stranger: and in the service of this ideal he desired to see his speculative science of politics applied. <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> has no political aim in view: he was purely a historian. But it was part of the method of both alike to eliminate conventional sentiment and morality.[63]
<br>
<br>In the seventeenth century, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>English</span> <span style='color: green'><b>English_language</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>political philosopher</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Political_philosophy</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thomas Hobbes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thomas_Hobbes</b></span>, whose <span style='color: blue'><b>Leviathan</b></span> advocated <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>absolute monarchy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Absolute_monarchy</b></span>, admired <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> and in 1628 was the first to translate his writings into <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>English</span> <span style='color: green'><b>English_language</b></span> directly from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>, Hobbes, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Machiavelli</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Merchant_Prince</b></span> are together considered the founding fathers of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>political realism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Realism_(international_relations)</b></span>, according to which, state policy must primarily or solely focus on the need to maintain military and economic power rather than on ideals or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ethics</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ethics</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Nineteenth-century <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>positivist</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Positivism</b></span> historians stressed what they saw as <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s seriousness, his scientific objectivity and his advanced handling of evidence. A virtual cult following developed among such German philosophers as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Friedrich Schelling</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Friedrich_Wilhelm_Joseph_Schelling</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Friedrich Schlegel</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Karl_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Schlegel</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Friedrich Nietzsche</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Friedrich_Nietzsche</b></span>, who claimed that, "[in <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>], the portrayer of Man, that culture of the most impartial knowledge of the world finds its last glorious <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>flower</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Flower</b></span>." The late-eighteenth-century <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Swiss</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Switzerland</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Johannes von Müller</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Johannes_von_Müller</b></span> described <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> as 'the favourite author of the greatest and noblest men, and one of the best teachers of the wisdom of human life.' [64] For <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Eduard</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Einstein_family</b></span> Meyer, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macaulay</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thomas_Babington_Macaulay</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leopold</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leopold_II_of_Belgium</b></span> von Ranke, who initiated modern source-based history writing,[65] <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> was again the model historian.[66][67]
<br>
<br>Generals and statesmen loved him: the world he drew was theirs, an exclusive power-brokers' club. It is no accident that even today <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> turns up as a guiding spirit in military academies, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>neocon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Neoconservatism</b></span> think tanks and the writings of men like <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Henry Kissinger</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Henry_Kissinger</b></span>; whereas <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> has been the choice of imaginative novelists (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Michael Ondaatje</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Michael_Ondaatje</b></span>'s novel <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The English Patient</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_English_Patient</b></span> and the film based on it boosted the sale of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span> to a wholly unforeseen degree) and—as food for a starved soul—of an equally imaginative foreign correspondent from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iron Curtain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iron_Curtain</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Poland</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ryszard Kapuscinski</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ryszard_Kapuściński</b></span>.[68]
<br>
<br>These historians also admired <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, however, as social and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ethnographic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ethnography</b></span> history increasingly came to be recognized as complementary to political history.[69] In the twentieth century, this trend gave rise to the works of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Johan Huizinga</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Johan_Huizinga</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marc Bloch</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Marc_Bloch</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Fernand Braudel</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Fernand_Braudel</b></span>, who pioneered the study of long-term cultural and economic developments and the patterns of everyday life. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Annales School</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Annales_School</b></span>, which exemplifies this direction, has been viewed as extending the tradition of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>.[70]
<br>
<br>At the same time, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>'s influence was increasingly important in the area of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>international</span> <span style='color: green'><b>International_law</b></span> relations during the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cold War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cold_War</b></span>, through the work of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hans Morgenthau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hans_Morgenthau</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leo Strauss</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leo_Strauss</b></span>,[71] and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Edward Carr</span> <span style='color: green'><b>E._H._Carr</b></span>.[72]
<br>
<br>The tension between the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thucydidean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thucydides</b></span> and Herodotean traditions extends beyond historical research. According to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Irving Kristol</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Irving_Kristol</b></span>, self-described founder of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>American neoconservatism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Neoconservatism</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> wrote "the favorite <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>neoconservative</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Neoconservatism</b></span> text on foreign affairs";[73] and <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> is a required text at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Naval War College</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naval_War_College</b></span>, an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>American</span> <span style='color: green'><b>United_States</b></span> institution located in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Rhode Island</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Rhode_Island</b></span>.
