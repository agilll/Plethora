<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> was the Spartan king who famously led a small band of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> allies at the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> in 480 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> where the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> valiantly defended the pass through which the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>king Xerxes</a> sought to invade <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> with his massive army. Ultimately, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> and his men were wiped out, but they bought the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> city-states valuable time and gave an inspirational example, not only of what <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>hoplites</a> could achieve against the invading forces but also of the price <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> were willing to pay to maintain their freedom from foreign oppression.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> in his <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Histories</a> describes the family lineage of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> which could be traced back 20 generations to the mythical hero <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heracles?lang=en'>Hercules</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a>’ father was the Spartan king <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anaxandrides?lang=en'>Anaxandrides</a>, himself the son of King Leon. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anaxandrides?lang=en'>Anaxandrides</a>, however, had some problems in producing an heir after his first wife proved barren. The Spartan <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephor?lang=en'>Ephors</a> and Elders, to protect the royal lineage, forced <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anaxandrides?lang=en'>Anaxandrides</a> to take a second wife. She did give birth to a son, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cleomenes_I?lang=en'>Cleomenes</a>, but in a strange twist <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anaxandrides?lang=en'>Anaxandrides</a>' first wife announced she was also now pregnant and another son, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dorieus?lang=en'>Dorieus</a>, was born. Then, shortly after, the first wife again gave birth sometime in the 540’s <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> and Kleombrotus, some saying the latter were twins. 
<br>
<br>As <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> had two older brothers it seemed unlikely he would represent the royal House of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_kings_of_Sparta?lang=en'>Agiad</a> and become one of the two <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_kings_of_Sparta?lang=en'>Spartan kings</a>. However, he did just that following the death of Doreius on campaign in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily?lang=en'>Sicily</a> and the mysterious <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seppuku?lang=en'>suicide</a> (put down to bad drinking habits) of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cleomenes_I?lang=en'>Cleomenes</a>, who left no heir. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> was married to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gorgon?lang=en'>Gorgo</a>, Cleomene’s daughter, and the death of her father meant <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> became king, sometime around 490 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>. 
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> would have been in his sixties by the time of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> and undoubtedly an experienced military commander, although we know nothing of his previous commands. Following <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes</a>' proposed land invasion of mainland <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> in 480 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> was selected to lead a small contingent of Spartan <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>hoplites</a> - some 300 hand-picked men with male heirs - to defend the pass of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> and hold the invading force until more troops could be mustered. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> at this time were involved in the sacred <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carnea?lang=en'>Karneia</a> festival and so, theoretically, could not go to war until it was over. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> could well have fielded up to 8,000 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>hoplites</a> but not during the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carnea?lang=en'>Karneia</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_300_Spartans?lang=en'>The 300 Spartans</a> were joined by troops form various other city-states to make up a force of up to 7,000 men, woefully inadequate to halt <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes</a>' army of 80,000.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a>, 150 km north of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>, was an excellent choice as the point to defend <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>, as there mountains rolled down into the sea leaving only a narrow pass along the coast. Nevertheless, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes</a> was so confident of success that he sent a messenger to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> to ask for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> to surrender and lay down their arms. The Spartan king’s laconic reply was ‘molōn <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elbe?lang=en'>labe</a>’ - come and get them.
<br>
<br>With <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> leading from the front and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>hoplites</a> fighting in their tight <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>phalanx formation</a>, they took full advantage of their superior armour and weapons and managed to hold the vast <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> army for two days. However, betrayed by a local shepherd who told the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> of a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mountain_warfare?lang=en'>mountain</a> path which would allow them to get behind the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> lines, things looked <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_grim?lang=en'>grim</a> for the defenders. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> ordered the bulk of his force to withdraw and kept with him only the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thespiae?lang=en'>Thespians</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thebes,_Greece?lang=en'>Thebans</a> in order to make a last stand and provide a rear-guard action.
<br>
<br>Ultimately, though, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> forces were wiped out to a man and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo?lang=en'>Apollo</a>’s <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delphi?lang=en'>oracle</a> at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delphi?lang=en'>Delphi</a> had been proved right when she had stated that either <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> or one of her kings must fall. After the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes</a> demanded that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a>’ head be put on a stake for public display, a highly dishonourable act and against all rules of warfare at that time.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a>’ son <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pleistarchus?lang=en'>Pleistarchus</a> became king on his father’s death but due to his young age <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pausanias_(geographer)?lang=en'>Pausanius</a> acted as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Regent?lang=en'>regent</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>, within a year, gained revenge for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> with victories at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Salamis</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Plataea?lang=en'>Plataea</a>; the latter even led by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pausanias_(geographer)?lang=en'>Pausanius</a>, nephew of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes</a>' invasion was emphatically rebuffed and those who fell at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> were not forgotten. A monument was set up at the site with the words of Simonedes’ <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epitaph?lang=en'>epitaph</a> stating: ‘go tell the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a>, you who read: We took their orders and here lie dead’. A stone lion was also placed in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memory?lang=en'>memory</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> and his men. Forty years after the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> the king’s remains were exhumed and returned to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> where they were given proper burial and a hero-shrine was also established in his honour.
<br>
<br>In ancient art, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I?lang=en'>Leonidas</a> is quite possibly the subject of a surviving <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marble?lang=en'>marble</a> statue from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acropolis_of_Athens?lang=en'>acropolis</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>, 490-480 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>. Resplendent in a crested <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinthian_helmet?lang=en'>Corinthian helmet</a>, his face, which would have had inlaid eyes, depicts the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_grim?lang=en'>grim</a>
