<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> (/θjuːˈsɪdɪdiːz/; <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>: Θουκυδίδης Thoukydídēs [tʰuːkydídɛːs]; c. 460 – c. 400 BC) was an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> historian and general. His History of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_War</a> recounts the fifth-century BC war between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> until the year 411 BC. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> has been dubbed the father of "scientific history" by those who accept his claims to have applied strict standards of impartiality and evidence-gathering and analysis of cause and effect, without reference to intervention by the deities, as outlined in his introduction to his work.[1][2]
<br>
<br>He also has been called the father of the school of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Realism_(international_relations)?lang=en'>Realism_(international_relations)</a>, which views the political behavior of individuals and the subsequent outcomes of relations between states as ultimately mediated by and constructed upon the emotions of fear and self-interest.[3] His text is still studied at universities and military colleges worldwide.[4] The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Siege_of_Melos?lang=en'>Siege_of_Melos</a> is regarded as a seminal work of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_law?lang=en'>International_law</a> relations theory, while his version of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pericles'_Funeral_Oration?lang=en'>Pericles'_Funeral_Oration</a> is widely studied by political theorists, historians, and students of the classics.
<br>
<br>More generally, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> developed an understanding of human nature to explain behaviour in such crises as plagues, massacres, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Civil_war?lang=en'>Civil_war</a>.
<br>
<br>In spite of his stature as a historian, modern historians know relatively little about <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>'s life. The most reliable information comes from his own History of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_War</a>, which expounds his nationality, paternity, and native <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Principle_of_locality?lang=en'>Principle_of_locality</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Institute_for_Operations_Research_and_the_Management_Sciences?lang=en'>Institute_for_Operations_Research_and_the_Management_Sciences</a> us that he fought in the war, contracted the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Black_Death?lang=en'>Black_Death</a>, and was exiled by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athenian_democracy?lang=en'>Athenian_democracy</a>. He may have also been involved in quelling the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samos?lang=en'>Samos</a> Revolt.[5]
<br>
<br>Evidence from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_antiquity?lang=en'>Classical_antiquity</a>[edit]
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> identifies himself as an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, telling us that his father's name was <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Olorus?lang=en'>Olorus</a> and that he was from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deme?lang=en'>Deme</a> of Halimous.[6] He survived the Plague of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>,[7] which killed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pericles?lang=en'>Pericles</a> and many other Athenians. He also records that he owned gold mines at Scapte <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hyle?lang=en'>Hyle</a> (literally "Dug Woodland"), a coastal area in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrace?lang=en'>Thrace</a>, opposite the island of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thasos?lang=en'>Thasos</a>.[8]
<br>
<br>Because of his influence in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrace?lang=en'>Thrace</a> region, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> wrote, he was sent as a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strategos?lang=en'>Strategos</a> (general) to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thasos?lang=en'>Thasos</a> in 424 BC. During the winter of 424–423 BC, the Spartan general <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brasidas?lang=en'>Brasidas</a> attacked <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amphipolis?lang=en'>Amphipolis</a>, a half-day's sail west from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thasos?lang=en'>Thasos</a> on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrace?lang=en'>Thrace</a> coast, instigating the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amphipolis?lang=en'>Amphipolis</a>. Eucles, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> commander at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amphipolis?lang=en'>Amphipolis</a>, sent to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> for help.[9] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brasidas?lang=en'>Brasidas</a>, aware the presence of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thasos?lang=en'>Thasos</a> and his influence with the people of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amphipolis?lang=en'>Amphipolis</a>, and afraid of help arriving by sea, acted quickly to offer moderate terms to the Amphipolitans for their surrender, which they accepted. Thus, when <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> arrived, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amphipolis?lang=en'>Amphipolis</a> was already under Spartan control.[10]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amphipolis?lang=en'>Amphipolis</a> was of considerable strategic importance, and news of its fall caused great consternation in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>.[11] It was blamed on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>, although he claimed that it was not his fault and that he had simply been unable to reach it in time. Because of his failure to save <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amphipolis?lang=en'>Amphipolis</a>, he was exiled:[12]
<br>
<br>I lived through the whole of it, being of an age to comprehend events, and giving my attention to them in order to know the exact truth about them. It was also my fate to be an exile from my country for twenty years after my command at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amphipolis?lang=en'>Amphipolis</a>; and being present with both parties, and more especially with the Peloponnesians by reason of my exile, I had leisure to observe affairs somewhat particularly.
<br>
<br>Using his status as an exile from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> to travel freely among the Peloponnesian allies, he was able to view the war from the perspective of both sides. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> claimed that he began writing his history as soon as the war broke out, because he thought it would be one of the greatest wars waged among the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> in terms of scale:
<br>
<br>"<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>, an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, wrote the history of the war between the Peloponnesians and the Athenians, beginning at the moment that it broke out, and believing that it would be a great war, and more worthy of relation than any that had preceded it."[13]
<br>
<br>This is all that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> wrote about his own life, but a few other facts are available from reliable contemporary sources. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> wrote that the name <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Olorus?lang=en'>Olorus</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>'s father's name, was connected with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrace?lang=en'>Thrace</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrace?lang=en'>Thrace</a> royalty.[14] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> was probably connected through family to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Winston_Churchill?lang=en'>Winston_Churchill</a> and general <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> and his son <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cimon?lang=en'>Cimon</a>, leaders of the old aristocracy supplanted by the Radical Democrats. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cimon?lang=en'>Cimon</a>'s maternal grandfather's name also was <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Olorus?lang=en'>Olorus</a>, making the connection exceedingly likely. Another <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> lived before the historian and was also linked with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrace?lang=en'>Thrace</a>, making a family connection between them very likely as well. Finally, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> confirms the connection of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>'s family with the mines at Scapté Hýlē.[15]
<br>
<br>Combining all the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fragmentary_Evidence?lang=en'>Fragmentary_Evidence</a> available, it seems that his family had owned a large estate in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrace?lang=en'>Thrace</a>, one that even contained gold mines, and which allowed the family considerable and lasting affluence. The security and continued prosperity of the wealthy estate must have necessitated formal ties with local kings or chieftains, which explains the adoption of the distinctly <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrace?lang=en'>Thrace</a> royal name Óloros into the family. Once exiled, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> took permanent residence in the estate and, given his ample income from the gold mines, he was able to dedicate himself to full-time history writing and research, including many fact-finding trips. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/In_Essence?lang=en'>In_Essence</a>, he was a well-connected gentleman of considerable resources who, after involuntarily retiring from the political and military spheres, decided to fund his own historical investigations.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Remaining?lang=en'>The_Remaining</a> evidence for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>'s life comes from rather less reliable, later ancient sources. According to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pausanias_of_Sparta?lang=en'>Pausanias_of_Sparta</a>, someone named Oenobius was able to get a law passed allowing <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> to return to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, presumably sometime shortly after the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a>'s surrender and the end of the war in 404 BC.[16] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pausanias_of_Sparta?lang=en'>Pausanias_of_Sparta</a> goes on to say that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> was murdered on his way back to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>. Many doubt this account, seeing evidence to suggest he lived as late as 397 BC. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> claims that his remains were returned to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> and placed in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cimon?lang=en'>Cimon</a>'s family <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bank_vault?lang=en'>Bank_vault</a>.[17]
<br>
<br>The abrupt end to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>'s narrative, which breaks off in the middle of the year 411 BC, has traditionally been interpreted that he died while writing the book, although other explanations have been put forward.
<br>
<br>Inferences about <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>'s character can only be drawn (with due caution) from his book. His sardonic sense of humour is evident throughout, as when, during his description of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Black_Death?lang=en'>Black_Death</a>, he remarks that old Athenians seemed to remember a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rhyme?lang=en'>Rhyme</a> which said that with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dorians?lang=en'>Dorians</a> War would come a "great death". Some claimed that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rhyme?lang=en'>Rhyme</a> originally mentioned a [death by] "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Famine?lang=en'>Famine</a>" or "starvation" (λιμός, limos[18]), and was only remembered later as [death by] "pestilence" (λοιμός, loimos[19]) due to the current <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Black_Death?lang=en'>Black_Death</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> then remarks that should another <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dorians?lang=en'>Dorians</a> War come, this time attended with a great dearth, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rhyme?lang=en'>Rhyme</a> will be remembered as "dearth," and any mention of "death" forgotten.[20]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> admired <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pericles?lang=en'>Pericles</a>, approving of his power over the people and showing a marked distaste for the demagogues who followed him. He did not approve of the democratic commoners nor the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Radical_democracy?lang=en'>Radical_democracy</a> that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pericles?lang=en'>Pericles</a> ushered in, but considered <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athenian_democracy?lang=en'>Athenian_democracy</a> acceptable when guided by a good leader.[21] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>'s presentation of events is generally even-handed; for example, he does not minimize the negative effect of his own failure at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amphipolis?lang=en'>Amphipolis</a>. Occasionally, however, strong passions break through, as in his scathing appraisals of the democratic leaders <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cleon?lang=en'>Cleon</a>[22][23] and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hyperbolus?lang=en'>Hyperbolus</a>.[24] Sometimes, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cleon?lang=en'>Cleon</a> has been connected with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>'s exile.[25]
<br>
<br>It has been argued that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> was moved by the suffering inherent in war and concerned about the excesses to which human nature is prone in such circumstances, as in his analysis of the atrocities committed during the civil conflict on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corfu?lang=en'>Corfu</a>,[26] which includes the phrase "war is a violent teacher" (πόλεμος βίαιος διδάσκαλος).
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> believed that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_War</a> represented an event of unmatched importance.[27] As such, he began to write the History at the onset of the war in 431.[28][29] His intention was to write an account which would serve as "a possession for all time".[30] The history breaks off near the end of the twenty-first year of the war and does not elaborate on the final conflicts of the war. This facet of the work suggests that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> died whilst writing his history and more so, that his death was unexpected.
<br>
<br>After his death, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>'s History was subdivided into eight books: its modern title is the History of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_War</a>. His great contribution to history and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Historiography?lang=en'>Historiography</a> is contained in this one dense history of the 27-year war between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>, each alongside their respective allies. This subdivision was most likely made by librarians and archivists, themselves being historians and scholars, most likely working in the Library of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexandria?lang=en'>Alexandria</a>.
<br>
<br>The History of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_War</a> continued to be modified well beyond the end of the war in 404, as exemplified by a reference at Book I.1.13[31] to the conclusion of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_War</a> (404 BC), seven years after the last events in the main text of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>' history.[32]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> is generally regarded as one of the first true historians. Like his predecessor <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, known as "the father of history", <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> places a high value on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eyewitness_testimony?lang=en'>Eyewitness_testimony</a> and writes about events in which he probably took part. He also assiduously consulted written documents and interviewed participants about the events that he recorded. Unlike <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, whose stories often teach that a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hubris?lang=en'>Hubris</a> invites the wrath of the deities, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> does not acknowledge divine intervention in human affairs.[33]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> exerted wide <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Historiography?lang=en'>Historiography</a> influence on subsequent <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hellenistic_period?lang=en'>Hellenistic_period</a> and Roman historians, although the exact description of his style in relation to many successive historians remains unclear.[34] Readers in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> often placed the continuation of the stylistic legacy of the History in the writings of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>' putative intellectual successor <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xenophon?lang=en'>Xenophon</a>. Such readings often described <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xenophon?lang=en'>Xenophon</a>'s treatises as attempts to "finish" <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>'s History. Many of these interpretations, however, have garnered significant scepticism among modern scholars, such as Dillery, who <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spurn?lang=en'>Spurn</a> the view of interpreting <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xenophon?lang=en'>Xenophon</a> qua <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>, arguing that the latter's "modern" history (defined as constructed based on literary and historical themes) is antithetical to the former's account in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hellenica?lang=en'>Hellenica</a>, which diverges from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Historiography?lang=en'>Historiography</a> tradition in its absence of a preface or introduction to the text and the associated lack of an "overarching concept" unifying the history.[35]
<br>
<br>A noteworthy difference between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>'s method of writing history and that of modern historians is <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>'s inclusion of lengthy formal speeches that, as he states, were literary reconstructions rather than quotations of what was said—or, perhaps, what he believed ought to have been said. Arguably, had he not done this, the gist of what was said would not otherwise be known at all—whereas today there is a plethora of documentation—written records, archives, and recording technology for historians to consult. Therefore, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>'s method served to rescue his mostly oral sources from oblivion. We do not know how these historical figures spoke. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>'s recreation uses a heroic stylistic register. A celebrated example is <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pericles'_Funeral_Oration?lang=en'>Pericles'_Funeral_Oration</a>, which heaps honour on the dead and includes a defence of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athenian_democracy?lang=en'>Athenian_democracy</a>:
<br>
<br>The whole earth is the sepulchre of famous men; they are honoured not only by columns and inscriptions in their own land, but in foreign nations on memorials graven not on stone but in the hearts and minds of men. (2:43)
<br>
<br>Stylistically, the placement of this passage also serves to heighten the contrast with the description of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Black_Death?lang=en'>Black_Death</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> immediately following it, which graphically emphasizes the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horror_fiction?lang=en'>Horror_fiction</a> of human <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death?lang=en'>Death</a>, thereby conveying a powerful sense of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Verisimilitude?lang=en'>Verisimilitude</a>:
<br>
<br>Though many lay unburied, birds and beasts would not touch them, or died after tasting them [...]. The bodies of dying men lay one upon another, and half-dead creatures reeled about the streets and gathered round all the fountains in their longing for water. The sacred places also in which they had quartered themselves were full of corpses of persons who had died there, just as they were; for, as the disaster passed all bounds, men, not knowing what was to become of them, became equally contemptuous of the property of and the dues to the deities. All the burial rites before in use were entirely upset, and they buried the bodies as best they could. Many from want of the proper appliances, through so many of their friends having died already, had recourse to the most <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shameless_(UK_TV_series)?lang=en'>Shameless_(UK_TV_series)</a> sepultures: sometimes getting the start of those who had raised a pile, they threw their own dead body upon the stranger's <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pyre?lang=en'>Pyre</a> and ignited it; sometimes they tossed the corpse which they were carrying on the top of another that was burning, and so went off. (2:52)
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> omits discussion of the arts, literature, or the social milieu in which the events in his book take place and in which he grew up. He saw himself as recording an event, not a period, and went to considerable <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse?lang=en'>Horse</a> to exclude what he deemed frivolous or extraneous.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Shorey?lang=en'>Paul_Shorey</a> calls <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> "a cynic devoid of moral sensibility".[36] In addition, he notes that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> conceived of human nature as strictly determined by one's physical and social environments, alongside basic desires.[37]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>' work indicates an influence from the teachings of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sophist?lang=en'>Sophist</a> that contributes substantially to the thinking and character of his History.[38] Possible evidence includes his skeptical ideas concerning justice and morality.[39] There are also elements within the History—such as his views on nature revolving around the factual, empirical, and the non-anthropomorphic—which suggest that he was at least aware of the views of philosophers such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anaxagoras?lang=en'>Anaxagoras</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democritus?lang=en'>Democritus</a>. There is also evidence of his knowledge concerning some of the corpus of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hippocrates?lang=en'>Hippocrates</a> medical writings.[40]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> was especially interested in the relationship between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Intelligence?lang=en'>Intelligence</a> and judgment,[41] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fortuna?lang=en'>Fortuna</a> and Necessity,[42] and the idea that history is too irrational and incalculable to predict.[43]

<br>Scholars traditionally view <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> as recognizing and teaching the lesson that democracies need leadership, but that leadership can be dangerous to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athenian_democracy?lang=en'>Athenian_democracy</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_Strauss?lang=en'>Leo_Strauss</a> (in The City and Man) locates the problem in the nature of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athenian_democracy?lang=en'>Athenian_democracy</a> itself, about which, he argued, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> had a deeply ambivalent view: on one hand, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>'s own "wisdom was made possible" by the Periclean <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athenian_democracy?lang=en'>Athenian_democracy</a>, which had the effect of liberating individual daring, enterprise, and questioning spirit; but this same liberation, by permitting the growth of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Limitless_(film)?lang=en'>Limitless_(film)</a> political ambition, led to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Imperialism?lang=en'>Imperialism</a> and, eventually, civic strife.[44]
<br>
<br>For <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canadians?lang=en'>Canadians</a> historian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_I_of_England?lang=en'>Charles_I_of_England</a> Norris Cochrane (1889–1945), <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>'s fastidious devotion to observable phenomena, focus on cause and effect, and strict exclusion of other factors anticipates twentieth-century scientific <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Positivism?lang=en'>Positivism</a>. Cochrane, the son of a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician?lang=en'>Physician</a>, speculated that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> generally (and especially in describing the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Black_Death?lang=en'>Black_Death</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>) was influenced by the methods and thinking of early medical writers such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hippocrates?lang=en'>Hippocrates</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kos?lang=en'>Kos</a>.[45]
<br>
<br>After <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/World_War_II?lang=en'>World_War_II</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_antiquity?lang=en'>Classical_antiquity</a> scholar <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jacqueline_de_Romilly?lang=en'>Jacqueline_de_Romilly</a> pointed out that the problem of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Imperialism?lang=en'>Imperialism</a> was one of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>'s central <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Preoccupations?lang=en'>Preoccupations</a> and situated his history in the context of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> thinking about <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_law?lang=en'>International_law</a> politics. Since the appearance of her study, other scholars further examined <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>'s treatment of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Realpolitik?lang=en'>Realpolitik</a>.
<br>
<br>More recently, scholars have questioned the perception of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> as simply, "the father of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Realpolitik?lang=en'>Realpolitik</a>". Instead they have brought to the fore the literary qualities of the History, which they see as belonging to the narrative tradition of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer?lang=en'>Homer</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hesiod?lang=en'>Hesiod</a> and as concerned with the concepts of justice and suffering found in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato?lang=en'>Plato</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle?lang=en'>Aristotle</a> and problematized in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aeschylus?lang=en'>Aeschylus</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sophocles?lang=en'>Sophocles</a>.[46] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Ned_Lebow?lang=en'>Richard_Ned_Lebow</a> terms <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> "the last of the tragedians", stating that "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> drew heavily on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epic_poetry?lang=en'>Epic_poetry</a> and tragedy to construct his history, which not surprisingly is also constructed as a narrative."[47] In this view, the blind and immoderate behaviour of the Athenians (and indeed of all the other actors) – although perhaps intrinsic to human nature – ultimately leads to their downfall. Thus his History could serve as a warning to future leaders to be more prudent, by putting them on notice that someone would be scrutinizing their actions with a historian's objectivity rather than a chronicler's flattery.[48]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Historian?lang=en'>The_Historian</a> J. B. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bury?lang=en'>Bury</a> writes that the work of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> "marks the longest and most decisive step that has ever been taken by a single man towards making history what it is today."[49]
<br>
<br>Historian H. D. Kitto feels that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> wrote about the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_War</a>, not because it was the most significant war in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>, but because it caused the most suffering. Indeed, several passages of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>'s book are written "with an intensity of feeling hardly exceeded by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sappho?lang=en'>Sappho</a> herself."[50]
<br>
<br>In his Open Society and Its Enemies, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Popper?lang=en'>Karl_Popper</a> writes that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> was the "greatest historian, perhaps, who ever lived." <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>'s work, however, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Popper?lang=en'>Karl_Popper</a> goes on to say, represents "an interpretation, a point of view; and in this we need not agree with him." In the war between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athenian_democracy?lang=en'>Athenian_democracy</a> and the "arrested <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oligarchy?lang=en'>Oligarchy</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tribalism?lang=en'>Tribalism</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>," we must never forget <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>'s "involuntary bias," and that "his heart was not with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, his native <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a>:"
<br>
<br>"Although he apparently did not belong to the extreme wing of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oligarchy?lang=en'>Oligarchy</a> clubs who conspired throughout the war with the enemy, he was certainly a member of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oligarchy?lang=en'>Oligarchy</a> party, and a friend neither of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> people, the demos, who had exiled him, nor of its <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Imperialism?lang=en'>Imperialism</a> policy."[51]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> and his immediate predecessor, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, both exerted a significant influence on Western <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Historiography?lang=en'>Historiography</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> does not mention his counterpart by name, but his famous introductory statement is thought to refer to him:[52][53]
<br>
<br>To hear this history rehearsed, for that there be inserted in it no fables, shall be perhaps not delightful. But he that desires to look into the truth of things done, and which (according to the condition of humanity) may be done again, or at least their like, shall find enough herein to make him think it profitable. And it is compiled rather for an everlasting possession than to be rehearsed for a prize. (1:22)
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> records in his <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> not only the events of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greco-Persian_Wars?lang=en'>Greco-Persian_Wars</a>, but also geographical and ethnographical information, as well as the fables related to him during his extensive travels. Typically, he passes no definitive judgment on what he has heard. In the case of conflicting or unlikely accounts, he presents both sides, says what he believes and then invites readers to decide for themselves.[54] The work of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> is reported to have been recited at festivals, where prizes were awarded, as for example, during the games at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opel_Olympia?lang=en'>Opel_Olympia</a>.[55]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> views history as a source of moral lessons, with conflicts and wars as misfortunes flowing from initial acts of injustice perpetuated through cycles of revenge.[56] In contrast, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> claims to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Confine?lang=en'>Confine</a> himself to factual reports of contemporary political and military events, based on unambiguous, first-hand, eye-witness accounts,[57] although, unlike <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, he does not reveal his sources. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> views life exclusively as political life, and history in terms of political history. Conventional moral considerations play no role in his analysis of political events while geographic and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ethnography?lang=en'>Ethnography</a> aspects are omitted or, at best, of secondary importance. Subsequent <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> historians—such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ctesias?lang=en'>Ctesias</a>, Diodorus, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strabo?lang=en'>Strabo</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polybius?lang=en'>Polybius</a> and Plutarch—held up <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>'s writings as a model of truthful history. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucian?lang=en'>Lucian</a>[58] refers to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> as having given <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> historians their law, requiring them to say what had been done (ὡς ἐπράχθη). <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> historians of the fourth century BC accepted that history was political and that contemporary history was the proper domain of a historian.[59] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cicero?lang=en'>Cicero</a> calls <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> the "father of history;"[60] yet the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> writer <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a>, in his <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moralia?lang=en'>Moralia</a> (Ethics) denigrated <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, notably calling him a philobarbaros, a "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barbarian?lang=en'>Barbarian</a> lover', to the detriment of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>.[61] Unlike <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>, however, these authors all continued to view history as a source of moral lessons.
<br>
<br>Due to the loss of the ability to read <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> were largely forgotten during the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages?lang=en'>Middle_Ages</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Western_world?lang=en'>Western_world</a>, although their influence continued in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Byzantium?lang=en'>Byzantium</a> world. In <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe?lang=en'>Europe</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> become known and highly respected only in the late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth century as an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ethnography?lang=en'>Ethnography</a>, in part due to the discovery of America, where customs and animals were encountered that were even more surprising than what he had related. During the Reformation, moreover, information about Middle Eastern countries in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> provided a basis for establishing <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chronology_of_the_Bible?lang=en'>Chronology_of_the_Bible</a> as advocated by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isaac_Newton?lang=en'>Isaac_Newton</a>.
<br>
<br>The first European translation of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> (into <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin?lang=en'>Latin</a>) was made by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Humanism?lang=en'>Humanism</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lorenzo_Valla?lang=en'>Lorenzo_Valla</a> between 1448 and 1452, and the first <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> edition was published by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aldus_Manutius?lang=en'>Aldus_Manutius</a> in 1502. During the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaissance?lang=en'>Renaissance</a>, however, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> attracted less interest among Western European historians as a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Political_philosophy?lang=en'>Political_philosophy</a> than his successor, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polybius?lang=en'>Polybius</a>,[62] although <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poggio_Bracciolini?lang=en'>Poggio_Bracciolini</a> claimed to have been influenced by him. There is not much evidence of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>'s influence in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Niccolò_Machiavelli?lang=en'>Niccolò_Machiavelli</a>'s <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Prince?lang=en'>The_Prince</a> (1513), which held that the chief aim of a new prince must be to "maintain his state" [i.e., his power] and that in so doing he is often compelled to act against faith, humanity, and religion. Later historians, such as J. B. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bury?lang=en'>Bury</a>, however, have noted parallels between them:
<br>
<br>If, instead of a history, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> had written an analytical treatise on politics, with particular reference to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Delian_League</a>, it is probable that ... he could have forestalled <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Merchant_Prince?lang=en'>Merchant_Prince</a>... [since] the whole <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Innuendo?lang=en'>Innuendo</a> of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> treatment of history agrees with the fundamental postulate of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Merchant_Prince?lang=en'>Merchant_Prince</a>, the supremacy of reason of state. To maintain a state said the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florence?lang=en'>Florence</a> thinker, "a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Winston_Churchill?lang=en'>Winston_Churchill</a> is often compelled to act against faith, humanity and religion." ... But ... the true <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Merchant_Prince?lang=en'>Merchant_Prince</a>, not the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Merchant_Prince?lang=en'>Merchant_Prince</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fable?lang=en'>Fable</a> ... entertained an ideal: <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy?lang=en'>Italy</a> for the Italians, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy?lang=en'>Italy</a> freed from the stranger: and in the service of this ideal he desired to see his speculative science of politics applied. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> has no political aim in view: he was purely a historian. But it was part of the method of both alike to eliminate conventional sentiment and morality.[63]
<br>
<br>In the seventeenth century, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/English_language?lang=en'>English_language</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Political_philosophy?lang=en'>Political_philosophy</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Hobbes?lang=en'>Thomas_Hobbes</a>, whose <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leviathan?lang=en'>Leviathan</a> advocated <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Absolute_monarchy?lang=en'>Absolute_monarchy</a>, admired <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> and in 1628 was the first to translate his writings into <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/English_language?lang=en'>English_language</a> directly from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>, Hobbes, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Merchant_Prince?lang=en'>Merchant_Prince</a> are together considered the founding fathers of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Realism_(international_relations)?lang=en'>Realism_(international_relations)</a>, according to which, state policy must primarily or solely focus on the need to maintain military and economic power rather than on ideals or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ethics?lang=en'>Ethics</a>.
<br>
<br>Nineteenth-century <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Positivism?lang=en'>Positivism</a> historians stressed what they saw as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>'s seriousness, his scientific objectivity and his advanced handling of evidence. A virtual cult following developed among such German philosophers as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friedrich_Wilhelm_Joseph_Schelling?lang=en'>Friedrich_Wilhelm_Joseph_Schelling</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Schlegel?lang=en'>Karl_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Schlegel</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friedrich_Nietzsche?lang=en'>Friedrich_Nietzsche</a>, who claimed that, "[in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>], the portrayer of Man, that culture of the most impartial knowledge of the world finds its last glorious <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flower?lang=en'>Flower</a>." The late-eighteenth-century <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Switzerland?lang=en'>Switzerland</a> historian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johannes_von_Müller?lang=en'>Johannes_von_Müller</a> described <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> as 'the favourite author of the greatest and noblest men, and one of the best teachers of the wisdom of human life.' [64] For <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Einstein_family?lang=en'>Einstein_family</a> Meyer, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Babington_Macaulay?lang=en'>Thomas_Babington_Macaulay</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leopold_II_of_Belgium?lang=en'>Leopold_II_of_Belgium</a> von Ranke, who initiated modern source-based history writing,[65] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> was again the model historian.[66][67]
<br>
<br>Generals and statesmen loved him: the world he drew was theirs, an exclusive power-brokers' club. It is no accident that even today <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> turns up as a guiding spirit in military academies, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neoconservatism?lang=en'>Neoconservatism</a> think tanks and the writings of men like <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Kissinger?lang=en'>Henry_Kissinger</a>; whereas <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> has been the choice of imaginative novelists (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Ondaatje?lang=en'>Michael_Ondaatje</a>'s novel <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_English_Patient?lang=en'>The_English_Patient</a> and the film based on it boosted the sale of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> to a wholly unforeseen degree) and—as food for a starved soul—of an equally imaginative foreign correspondent from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron_Curtain?lang=en'>Iron_Curtain</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poland?lang=en'>Poland</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ryszard_Kapuściński?lang=en'>Ryszard_Kapuściński</a>.[68]
<br>
<br>These historians also admired <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, however, as social and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ethnography?lang=en'>Ethnography</a> history increasingly came to be recognized as complementary to political history.[69] In the twentieth century, this trend gave rise to the works of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johan_Huizinga?lang=en'>Johan_Huizinga</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marc_Bloch?lang=en'>Marc_Bloch</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fernand_Braudel?lang=en'>Fernand_Braudel</a>, who pioneered the study of long-term cultural and economic developments and the patterns of everyday life. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Annales_School?lang=en'>Annales_School</a>, which exemplifies this direction, has been viewed as extending the tradition of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>.[70]
<br>
<br>At the same time, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>'s influence was increasingly important in the area of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_law?lang=en'>International_law</a> relations during the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cold_War?lang=en'>Cold_War</a>, through the work of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hans_Morgenthau?lang=en'>Hans_Morgenthau</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_Strauss?lang=en'>Leo_Strauss</a>,[71] and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/E._H._Carr?lang=en'>E._H._Carr</a>.[72]
<br>
<br>The tension between the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> and Herodotean traditions extends beyond historical research. According to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Irving_Kristol?lang=en'>Irving_Kristol</a>, self-described founder of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neoconservatism?lang=en'>Neoconservatism</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> wrote "the favorite <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neoconservatism?lang=en'>Neoconservatism</a> text on foreign affairs";[73] and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> is a required text at the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naval_War_College?lang=en'>Naval_War_College</a>, an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States?lang=en'>United_States</a> institution located in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rhode_Island?lang=en'>Rhode_Island</a>. On the other hand, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daniel_Mendelsohn?lang=en'>Daniel_Mendelsohn</a>, in a review of a recent edition of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, suggests that, at least in his <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Postgraduate_education?lang=en'>Postgraduate_education</a> days during the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cold_War?lang=en'>Cold_War</a>, professing admiration of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> served as a form of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Impression_management?lang=en'>Impression_management</a>:
<br>
<br>To be an admirer of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>' History, with its deep cynicism about political, rhetorical and ideological hypocrisy, with its all too recognizable protagonists—a liberal yet imperialistic <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athenian_democracy?lang=en'>Athenian_democracy</a> and an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Authoritarianism?lang=en'>Authoritarianism</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oligarchy?lang=en'>Oligarchy</a>, engaged in a war of attrition fought by proxy at the remote fringes of empire—was to advertise yourself as a hardheaded connoisseur of global <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Realpolitik?lang=en'>Realpolitik</a>.[74]

<br>Another contemporary historian believes that,[76] while it is true that critical history "began with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>, one may also argue that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>’ looking at the past as a reason why the present is the way it is, and to search for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Causality?lang=en'>Causality</a> for events beyond the realms of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tyche?lang=en'>Tyche</a>
