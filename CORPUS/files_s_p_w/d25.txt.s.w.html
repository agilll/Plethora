<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> was the Spartan king who famously led a small band of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> allies at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span> in 480 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> where the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> valiantly defended the pass through which the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>king Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> sought to invade <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> with his massive army. Ultimately, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> and his men were wiped out, but they bought the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states valuable time and gave an inspirational example, not only of what <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> could achieve against the invading forces but also of the price <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> were willing to pay to maintain their freedom from foreign oppression.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> in his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span> describes the family lineage of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> which could be traced back 20 generations to the mythical hero <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hercules</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Heracles</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>’ father was the Spartan king <span style='color: blue'><b>Anaxandrides</b></span>, himself the son of King Leon. <span style='color: blue'><b>Anaxandrides</b></span>, however, had some problems in producing an heir after his first wife proved barren. The Spartan <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ephors</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephor</b></span> and Elders, to protect the royal lineage, forced <span style='color: blue'><b>Anaxandrides</b></span> to take a second wife. She did give birth to a son, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span>, but in a strange twist <span style='color: blue'><b>Anaxandrides</b></span>' first wife announced she was also now pregnant and another son, <span style='color: blue'><b>Dorieus</b></span>, was born. Then, shortly after, the first wife again gave birth sometime in the 540’s <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> and Kleombrotus, some saying the latter were twins. 
<br>
<br>As <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> had two older brothers it seemed unlikely he would represent the royal House of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Agiad</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_kings_of_Sparta</b></span> and become one of the two <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartan kings</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_kings_of_Sparta</b></span>. However, he did just that following the death of Doreius on campaign in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicily</b></span> and the mysterious <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>suicide</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Seppuku</b></span> (put down to bad drinking habits) of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span>, who left no heir. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> was married to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Gorgo</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gorgon</b></span>, Cleomene’s daughter, and the death of her father meant <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> became king, sometime around 490 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. 
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> would have been in his sixties by the time of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span> and undoubtedly an experienced military commander, although we know nothing of his previous commands. Following <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>' proposed land invasion of mainland <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> in 480 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> was selected to lead a small contingent of Spartan <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> - some 300 hand-picked men with male heirs - to defend the pass of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span> and hold the invading force until more troops could be mustered. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> at this time were involved in the sacred <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Karneia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Carnea</b></span> festival and so, theoretically, could not go to war until it was over. <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> could well have fielded up to 8,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> but not during the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Karneia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Carnea</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The 300 Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_300_Spartans</b></span> were joined by troops form various other city-states to make up a force of up to 7,000 men, woefully inadequate to halt <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>' army of 80,000.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span>, 150 km north of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, was an excellent choice as the point to defend <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, as there mountains rolled down into the sea leaving only a narrow pass along the coast. Nevertheless, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> was so confident of success that he sent a messenger to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> to ask for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> to surrender and lay down their arms. The Spartan king’s laconic reply was ‘molōn <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>labe</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Elbe</b></span>’ - come and get them.
<br>
<br>With <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> leading from the front and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> fighting in their tight <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx formation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span>, they took full advantage of their superior armour and weapons and managed to hold the vast <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army for two days. However, betrayed by a local shepherd who told the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> of a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mountain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mountain_warfare</b></span> path which would allow them to get behind the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> lines, things looked <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>grim</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Church_grim</b></span> for the defenders. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> ordered the bulk of his force to withdraw and kept with him only the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thespians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thespiae</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thebes,_Greece</b></span> in order to make a last stand and provide a rear-guard action.
<br>
<br>Ultimately, though, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> forces were wiped out to a man and <span style='color: blue'><b>Apollo</b></span>’s <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oracle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delphi</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Delphi</b></span> had been proved right when she had stated that either <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> or one of her kings must fall. After the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> demanded that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>’ head be put on a stake for public display, a highly dishonourable act and against all rules of warfare at that time.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>’ son <span style='color: blue'><b>Pleistarchus</b></span> became king on his father’s death but due to his young age <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_(geographer)</b></span> acted as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>regent</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Regent</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, within a year, gained revenge for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span> with victories at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Plataea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Plataea</b></span>; the latter even led by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_(geographer)</b></span>, nephew of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>' invasion was emphatically rebuffed and those who fell at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span> were not forgotten. A monument was set up at the site with the words of Simonedes’ <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>epitaph</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Epitaph</b></span> stating: ‘go tell the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, you who read: We took their orders and here lie dead’. A stone lion was also placed in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>memory</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Memory</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> and his men. Forty years after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> the king’s remains were exhumed and returned to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> where they were given proper burial and a hero-shrine was also established in his honour.
<br>
<br>In ancient art, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> is quite possibly the subject of a surviving <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>marble</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Marble</b></span> statue from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>acropolis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Acropolis_of_Athens</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, 490-480 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. Resplendent in a crested <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthian helmet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corinthian_helmet</b></span>, his face, which would have had inlaid eyes, depicts the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>grim</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Church_grim</b></span>
