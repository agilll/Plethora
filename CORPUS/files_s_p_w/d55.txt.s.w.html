<span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span>, also known as Harpagos or Hypargus (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ancient Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> Ἅρπαγος; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Akkadian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Akkadian_language</b></span>: Arbaku), was a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> general from the 6th century BC, credited by <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> as having put <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> the Great on the throne through his defection during the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Pasargadae</b></span>.
<br>
<br>According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> was a member of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> royal house in service to King <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>, the last king of Media.
<br>
<br>When word reached <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> was gathering his forces, he ordered <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span>, as his primary general, to lead the army against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>. After a three-day <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Plain</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Pasargadae</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> took his revenge for the death of his son when he turned on the battlefield in favor of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>, resulting in <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>' defeat and the formation of the Persian <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> accounts for the turn of <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span>' support to a version of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cannibal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cannibalism</b></span> feast of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thyestes</b></span>.[1] He reports that <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>, after having a dream that his daughter, Mandane, would give birth to a king who would overthrow him, ordered <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> to expose the child at birth. <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span>, reluctant to spill his own royal <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>blood</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Food_and_drink_prohibitions</b></span>, gave the child (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>) to a shepherd named Mitradates,[2] who raised him as his own son.
<br>
<br>Ten years later, when <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> was discovered alive, <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> cruelly punished <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> by killing <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span>' only son and feeding him to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>courtier</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Courtier</b></span> during a banquet. It is said that <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> did not react during the banquet, other than to gather the pieces of his son and remove them for burial. <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> then asked his <span style='color: blue'><b>Magi</b></span> (priests) for their advice about the fate of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>. They told him that the boy, who had been discovered while playing king of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mountain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mountain_gun</b></span> with his friends, had fulfilled the prophecy of becoming a king, albeit in play, and was no longer a danger. On their advice, <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> sent <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> to his parents, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_I</b></span> and Mandane, in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Anšan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anshan_(Persia)</b></span> (southwestern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span> near <span style='color: blue'><b>Shiraz</b></span>).
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> bided his time, sending gifts to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> to keep contact with him, as he worked to turn the nobles of Media against <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>. When they were ready, he sent a message to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>, hidden in the belly of a hare, informing him that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Medians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> would <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mutiny</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mutiny</b></span> on the field, should he take arms against his grandfather.
<br>
<br>"<span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>, as soon as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> was born, sent for <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span>, a man of his own house and the most faithful of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>...."
<br>
<br>"When <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> beheld the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> arranging themselves in order of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> on this <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Plain</b></span>, fearful of the strength of their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>, he adopted a device which <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span>, one of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>, suggested to him. He collected together all the camels that had come in the train of his army to carry the provisions and the baggage, and taking off their loads, he mounted riders upon them accoutred as horsemen. These he commanded to advance in front of his other troops against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>horse</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>..."
<br>
<br>"<span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>, meanwhile, took the son of <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span>, and slew him, after which he cut him in pieces, and roasted some portions before the fire, and boiled others..."
<br>
<br>"When <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> grew to manhood, and became known as the bravest and most popular of all his compeers, <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span>, who was bent on revenging himself upon <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>, began to pay him court by gifts and messages..."
<br>
<br>"Upon <span style='color: blue'><b>Mazares</b></span>' death, <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> was sent down to the coast to succeed to his command. He also was of the race of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>, being the man whom the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> king, <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>, feasted at the unholy banquet, and who lent his aid to place <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> upon the throne..."
<br>
<br>"After conquering the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> proceeded to attack the <span style='color: blue'><b>Carians</b></span>, the Caunians, and the <span style='color: blue'><b>Lycians</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeolians</b></span> were forced to serve in his army..."

<br>
<br>"King <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> called up his troops and marched against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>, king of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Anšan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anshan_(Persia)</b></span> (southwest <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span>), in order to meet him in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>. The army of <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> revolted against him and in fetters they delivered him to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> marched against the country <span style='color: blue'><b>Ecbatana</b></span>; the royal residence he seized; silver, gold, other valuables of the country <span style='color: blue'><b>Ecbatana</b></span> he took as booty and brought to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Anšan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anshan_(Persia)</b></span>."[3]
<br>
<br>After the defeat of <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> (550 BC) <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> started - according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> - a military career under the new ruler <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>:
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> suggested using camels as the front line against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>'s war against <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span>, thereby <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>scattering</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Scattering</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> (the horses panicked at the smell of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dromedaries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dromedary</b></span>).
<br>Following a revolt by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> and the death of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>'s infantry commander, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>General</span> <span style='color: green'><b>General_officer</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Mazares</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> turned over the conquest of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> to <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span>, who went on to serve as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>'s most successful general.
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> general followed his victory at <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span> by conquering <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Phoenicia</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Caria</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Lycia</b></span> and many other regions of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> (except <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, which had earned the favor of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> through their great <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sage</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Rishi</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Thales</b></span>'s advice to stay neutral in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> war).
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> was also known for innovations in engineering techniques, specifically, the use of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>earthwork</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Fortification</b></span> ramps and mounds during sieges (a method later employed by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> during his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tyre</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tire</b></span>) and for the use of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mountain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mountain_gun</b></span> climbers to scale opponents' walls.
<br>Despite <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span>' reputation for mercy, the residents of <span style='color: blue'><b>Xanthos</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Lycia</b></span> committed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>suicide</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Seppuku</b></span> rather than surrender to him, saying that they had never been conquered.
<br>Later life[edit]
<br>After the completion of his conquests, <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> was appointed <span style='color: blue'><b>Satrap</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>.
