<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> (c. 550-486 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>), also known as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> the Great, was the third <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> King of the Achaemenid <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span>. His reign lasted 36 years, from c. 522 to 486 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>; during this time the Persian <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span> reached its peak. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> led military campaigns in <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, and even in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Indus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Indus_River</b></span> valley, conquering lands and expanding his empire. Not only resuming to military prowess, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> also improved the legal and economic system and conducted impressive construction projects across the Persian <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The most important primary sources, that tell us about his life and reign, are his inscriptions, the most famous example being the trilingual inscription, in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Akkadian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Akkadian_language</b></span> or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylon</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Elamite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Elamite_language</b></span>, and old <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, carved on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bisitun</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Behistun_Inscription</b></span> (Behistun) <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>rock relief</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Rock_relief</b></span> from the village of the same name and from his palace at <span style='color: blue'><b>Persepolis</b></span>. Also, accounts about his reign were chronicled by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> was born in c. 550 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, the oldest son of Hystapes and Rhodugune. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Behistun inscription</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Behistun_Inscription</b></span> mentions that his father occupied the position of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> (regional leader) of <span style='color: blue'><b>Bactria</b></span> and Persis during the reign of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> (559-530 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>) and his son, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span> (530-522 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>). During the reign of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> held the position of spearman (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>doryphoros</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Doryphoros</b></span>)  and accompanied the king in his campaign to Egypt between 528 and 525 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. Before leaving for Egypt, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span> named Patizithes as custodian of the royal palace in his absence. Patizithes saw this situation as an opportunity to gain power. He set up his own brother, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Gaumata</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bardiya</b></span>, as a false king under the name of <span style='color: blue'><b>Bardiya</b></span> or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Smerdis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bardiya</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span>' brother, becoming the new ruler in 522 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span> returned to his country seven months later only to find that he could not take his throne back. Some historical sources say he took his own life as he was unable to defeat the impostor king and his supporters, while other tell us he fell during the marches through <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Syrian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Syria</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Ecbatana</b></span> or through <span style='color: blue'><b>Damascus</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The false king’s reign did not last long. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> tells us that Phaedymia, the daughter of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span>' uncle, <span style='color: blue'><b>Otanes</b></span>, found out that the ruler is not <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span>' brother. Her father, after learning the truth, quickly assembled a group of conspirators which included <span style='color: blue'><b>Hydarnes</b></span>, Intaphrenes, <span style='color: blue'><b>Megabyzus</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>, who at the time was still the king’s <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>lancer</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lancer</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Gaumata</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bardiya</b></span> was finally assassinated, leaving the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> empire without a leader; the conspirators had to decide the future of the empire. <span style='color: blue'><b>Otanes</b></span> opted out, wanting only special privileges for his family, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oligarchy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Oligarchy</b></span> was suggested by <span style='color: blue'><b>Megabyzus</b></span>, while <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> voted for a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>monarchy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Monarchy</b></span>. Being unable to settle the matter at hand, all of them agreed on a contest, where the winner would take the throne. All of them would meet the next morning, each on his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>horse</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>, and the first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>horse</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> to neigh at the sunrise would be named the new king. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> tells us that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> cheated; supposedly it was his servant, <span style='color: blue'><b>Oebares</b></span>, who made the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>horse</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> neigh by letting the animal smell his hand that he had previously rubbed over the genitals of a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mare</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Horse</b></span>. In any case, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>horse</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>'s neigh accompanied by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>lightning</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lightning</b></span> and thunder from a storm convinced the others to accept <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> as the new king in 522 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Even though <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Gaumata</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bardiya</b></span> was a false ruler, only a portion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrapies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> recognised <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> as their king, after his coronation, in 522 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, such as <span style='color: blue'><b>Bactria</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Arachosia</b></span>. Others saw the false king's death as a chance for independence. Revolts broke out across many regions of the empire, including Persis, Media, <span style='color: blue'><b>Parthia</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Assyria</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span>, and Egypt, and only with aid of his army and personal entourage did <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> manage to quell these conflicts. These events are chronicled in great detail in his inscriptions, translated by Herbert <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cushing</span> <span style='color: green'><b>William_B._Cushing</b></span>, which also serve as a warning for future kings:
<br>
<br>Says <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> the king: O thou who shalt be king in
<br>the future, protect thyself strongly from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Deceit</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Deception</b></span>;
<br>whatever man shall be a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>deceiver</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Foreigner_universe</b></span>, him who deserves
<br>to be punished, punish, if thus thou shalt think " may
<br>my country be secure." 
<br>
<br>Says <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> the king: O thou who shalt be
<br>king in the future, whatever man shall be a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>deceiver</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Foreigner_universe</b></span>
<br>or a wrong-doer (be) not a friend to these; punish
<br>(them) with severe punishment. 
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>' rule was marked by vast military expeditions. After consolidating his power at home, he set off to secure the lands of Egypt, which had been conquered before by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span>, and in 519 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> he incorporated a large part of Egypt into his empire. The following year, in 518 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, he conquered parts of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>India</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_India</b></span>, namely northern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Punjab</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Punjab_(region)</b></span> as his inscriptions testify. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>adds</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Applied_Digital_Data_Systems</b></span> that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>India</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_India</b></span> was the 20th <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> of the empire and also that parts of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Indus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Indus_River</b></span> valley were also conquered.
<br>
<br>The next significant campaign was in European <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Scythia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Scythians</b></span> in 513 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. Historians have proposed several theories in an attempt to clarify the objective of this campaign. They range from simple military conquest to a more propagandistic motive, revenge for a previous conflict during the reign of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> where the <span style='color: blue'><b>Scythians</b></span> had attacked <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>. Another possible reason is that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> wanted to conquer the western <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> lands and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Scythian campaign</span> <span style='color: green'><b>European_Scythian_campaign_of_Darius_I</b></span> was supposed to threaten the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> into surrender.
<br>
<br>However, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> faced unforeseen difficulties. The <span style='color: blue'><b>Scythians</b></span> evaded the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army, using <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>feints</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Feint</b></span> and retreating eastwards, all the while laying waste to the countryside. The king's army chased the enemy deep into <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Scythian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Scythians</b></span> lands, where he sent word to their ruler, urging <span style='color: blue'><b>Idanthyrsus</b></span> to fight or surrender. As <span style='color: blue'><b>Idanthyrsus</b></span> refused to do either, the chase resumed. In the end, the campaign halted after a few weeks when sickness and deprivation had taken its toll on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army. The march halted around the banks of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Volga</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Volga_River</b></span> river and then headed towards <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span>, where <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> ordered his general <span style='color: blue'><b>Megabyzus</b></span> to subjugate the region.
<br>
<br>Besides bringing <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span> under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> influence, <span style='color: blue'><b>Megabyzus</b></span> also conquered the neighbouring <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities. He sent envoys to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedonia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Republic_of_Macedonia</b></span> where <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Amyntas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Amyntas_I_of_Macedon</b></span>, the king of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedonia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Republic_of_Macedonia</b></span>, became a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vassal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vassal</b></span> of the empire. Meanwhile, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> solidified his hold in <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean Islands</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Islands</b></span> through appointments of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> natives as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> rulers or tyrants.
<br>
<br>In 499 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, convinced the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> to sponsor a campaign against <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> gave his consent and named <span style='color: blue'><b>Megabates</b></span>, Artaphemes’s cousin, as commander of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army. They were supposed to be supported and supplied by <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>, but a quarrel between <span style='color: blue'><b>Megabates</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> resulted in the former betraying them and informing the Naxians of their plans, sabotaging the campaign. Finding himself without help, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> decided to revolt against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. Seeking other allies, although he failed to acquire the support of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, he managed to secure the aid of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>, both providing troops and ships.
<br>
<br>After six years of conflict, during which <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyprus</b></span>, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> were attacked, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army defeated the rebels at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> in 494 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> where most of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> fleet was destroyed. Undeterred, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> gathered his army, planning to conquer <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>. His army consisted of infantry and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>, led by the general Datis. They marched from <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span> to <span style='color: blue'><b>Cilicia</b></span>, where ships carried them across the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean Sea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> to the island of <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span>. Here they joined up with an armed force from <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> and sailed north, to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Meanwhile, the Athenians started to prepare for war. Envoys were sent to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, but after gathering allies, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> force was still only 10,000 strong, facing 100,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Outnumbered</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Outnumbered_(UK_TV_series)</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> generals needed a brilliant strategy. Two of them advised facing the enemy from within the safety of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> gates, but <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> convinced them that a direct attack would be a better choice. They agreed, on condition that <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> would lead the army into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The two opposing armies met on the fields of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> in 490 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army, though heavily outnumbering the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army, was slow and overconfident. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> took advantage of this situation; as the two armies approached each other at a casual pace, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> suddenly broke into a sprint. This caught the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> off guard, and before they knew it they were forced to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> in full hand-to-hand combat. After a few hours of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> ranks broke, many of them running towards the safety of the ships or to the nearby mountains. 6,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fell, while the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army lost only 200 men. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>marble</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Marble</b></span> blocks which the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> intended to use for the monument they were going to erect after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, was instead used by the victorious <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> to build a monument for their fallen comrades. This blow was seen as an insult by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>, who chose to fight on and prepared for another invasion. This plan, however, never came to fruition due to his death in 486 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The Persian <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span> witnessed many improvements during <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>' reign. He established 20 provinces or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrapies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span>, with an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>archon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archon</b></span> or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> assigned to each. Neighbouring regions paid a fixed tribute; a fair amount was stipulated by a commission of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>' trusted officials. 
<br>
<br>He also improved the legal system, using the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylon</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Hammurabi</b></span> as a model and copying some of his laws completely. The laws were enforced by the judges of the empire, who needed to be incorruptible. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> removed the previous native officials, replacing them with new people loyal to him. While the punishments may seem brutal today, ranging from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mutilation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Political_mutilation_in_Byzantine_culture</b></span> to blinding, fairness was not omitted as punishment depended on the nature and severity of the crime. The new system proved to be popular, even after <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>’s death, some laws were still in use in 218 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>.
<br>
<br>In the matters of religion, it is well known that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> was an adherent of <span style='color: blue'><b>Zoroastrianism</b></span> or at least a firm believer of Ahura <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mazda</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ahura_Mazda</b></span>. This we can see in his inscriptions, where he attributes his success to Ahura <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mazda</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ahura_Mazda</b></span>, and in his legal system where all laws were created in the name of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zoroastrian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zoroastrianism</b></span> god. In the lands that were under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> control, all other religions were tolerated as long as they remained submissive and peaceful.
<br>
<br>During his reign, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> undertook impressive construction projects across the empire. In <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span>, he built a palace complex in the northern part of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>, which became his favourite residence. A grand project in <span style='color: blue'><b>Persepolis</b></span> followed; the palace complex included a military quarter, treasury, the king’s quarters and guest house. Besides the palaces, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> also finished previously incomplete construction projects of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Pasargadae</b></span>. In Egypt, he built many temples and restored those that had previously been destroyed.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> introduced a new universal <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>currency</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Currency</b></span>, the darayaka, sometime before 500 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. This innovation made it easier to collect taxes on land, livestock, and marketplaces, which led to improved revenues for the empire. To further improve the economy and help traders, a new standardised system of weights and measures was introduced.
<br>
<br>After the defeat at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> did not want to give up on his dream to conquer <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. He vowed to gather an even larger army, this time leading it personally, to fight the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. After three years of preparing, during which he became ill, a revolt broke out in Egypt that only worsened his condition. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> died in October 486 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>; his body was interred at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Naqsh-e Rustam</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naqsh-e_Rustam</b></span> in a tomb prepared by him beforehand, a custom of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> kings. After his death, the throne was inherited by his eldest son from his marriage with <span style='color: blue'><b>Atossa</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>’s reign was one of the most important episodes in the history of the Persian <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span>. His military conquest expanded the boundaries of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>
