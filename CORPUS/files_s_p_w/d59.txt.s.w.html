<span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> (/θəˈmɪstəˌkliːz/; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>: Θεμιστοκλῆς <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> pronunciation: [tʰemistoklɛ̂ːs] Themistoklẽs; "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Glory</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Perth_Glory_FC</b></span> of the Law";[1] c. 524–<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>459 BC</span> <span style='color: green'><b>459_BC</b></span>) was an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> politician and general. He was one of a new <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>breed</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dog_breed</b></span> of non-aristocratic politicians who rose to prominence in the early years of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span>. As a politician, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> was a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>populist</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Populism</b></span>, having the support of lower-class Athenians, and generally being at odds with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> nobility. Elected <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>archon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archon</b></span> in 493 BC, he convinced the polis to increase the naval power of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, a recurring theme in his political career. During the first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> he fought at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>[2] (490 BC) and was possibly one of the ten <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>strategoi</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Strategos</b></span> (generals) in that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>.[citation needed]
<br>
<br>In the years after <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, and in the run-up to the second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of 480-479 BC, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> became the most prominent politician in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>. He continued to advocate a strong <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Navy</b></span>, and in 483 BC he persuaded the Athenians to build a fleet of 200 triremes; these proved crucial in the forthcoming conflict with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. During the second invasion, he effectively exercised command of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> allied navy at the battles of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> in 480 BC. Due to subterfuge on the part of <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> lured the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet into the Straits of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>, and the decisive <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> victory there was the turning point in the invasion, which ended the following year with the defeat of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> at the land Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>.
<br>
<br>After the conflict ended, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> continued his pre-eminence among <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> politicians. However, he aroused the hostility of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> by ordering the re-fortification of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, and his perceived arrogance began to alienate him from the Athenians. In 472 or 471 BC, he was ostracised, and went into exile in <span style='color: blue'><b>Argos</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> now saw an opportunity to destroy <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, and implicated him in the alleged treasonous plot of 478 BC of their own general <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> thus fled from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> I of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span> (reigned 498-454 BC) temporarily gave him sanctuary at <span style='color: blue'><b>Pydna</b></span> before he traveled to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>, where he entered the service of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> king <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia</b></span> (reigned 465-424 BC). He was made governor of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Magnesia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Magnesia_on_the_Maeander</b></span>, and lived there for the rest of his life.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> died in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>459 BC</span> <span style='color: green'><b>459_BC</b></span>, probably of natural causes. <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s reputation was posthumously rehabilitated, and he was re-established as a hero of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> (and indeed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>) cause. <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> can still reasonably be thought of as "the man most instrumental in achieving the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>salvation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salvation</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>" from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> threat, as <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> describes him. His naval policies would have a lasting impact on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> as well, since maritime power became the cornerstone of the Athenian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> and golden age. <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> assessed <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> as "a man who exhibited the most indubitable signs of genius; indeed, in this particular he has a claim on our admiration quite extraordinary and unparalleled".[citation needed]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> was born in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Attic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>deme</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Deme</b></span> of Phrearrhioi around 524 BC,[3] the son of Neocles, who was, in the words of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> "no very conspicuous man".[4] His mother is more obscure; according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>, she was either a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thracian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thrace</b></span> woman called Abrotonon, or <span style='color: blue'><b>Euterpe</b></span>, a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Carian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Carians</b></span> from Halicarnassus.[4] Like many contemporaries, little is known of his early years. Some authors report that he was unruly as a child and was consequently disowned by his father.[5][6] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> considers this to be false.[7] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> indicates that, on account of his mother's background, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> was considered something of an outsider; furthermore the family appear to have lived in an immigrant district of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Cynosarges</b></span>, outside the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> walls.[4] However, in an early example of his cunning, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> persuaded "well-born" children to exercise with him in <span style='color: blue'><b>Cynosarges</b></span>, thus breaking down the distinction between "alien and legitimate".[4] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> further reports that <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> was preoccupied, even as a child, with preparing for public life.[7] His teacher is said to have told him:[7]
<br>
<br>"My boy, you will be nothing insignificant, but definitely something great, either for good or evil."
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> left three sons by Archippe, daughter to <span style='color: blue'><b>Lysander</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Alopece</b></span>,[8]—Archeptolis, <span style='color: blue'><b>Polyeuctus</b></span>, and Cleophantus. <span style='color: blue'><b>Plato</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>philosopher</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Philosopher</b></span> mentions Cleophantus as a most excellent horseman, but otherwise insignificant person. And <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> had two sons older than these three, Neocles and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Diocles</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Diocletian</b></span>. Neocles died when he was young by the bite of a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>horse</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Diocles</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Diocletian</b></span> was adopted by his grandfather, <span style='color: blue'><b>Lysander</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> had many daughters, of whom Mnesiptolema, whom he had by a second marriage, was wife to Archeptolis, her brother by another mother, and became priestess of <span style='color: blue'><b>Cybele</b></span>; Italia was married to <span style='color: blue'><b>Panthoides</b></span>, of the island of <span style='color: blue'><b>Chios</b></span>; <span style='color: blue'><b>Sybaris</b></span> to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Nicomedes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nicomedes_IV_of_Bithynia</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>. After the death of <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, his nephew, Phrasicles, went to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Magnesia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Magnesia_on_the_Maeander</b></span>, and married, with her brothers' consent, another daughter, Nicomache, and took charge of her sister <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>, the youngest of all ten children.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> grew up in a period of upheaval in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Peisistratos</b></span> had died in 527 BC, passing power to his sons, <span style='color: blue'><b>Hipparchus</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span>.[9] <span style='color: blue'><b>Hipparchus</b></span> was murdered in 514 BC, and in response to this, <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span> became paranoid and started to rely increasingly on foreign <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mercenaries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mercenary</b></span> to keep a hold on power.[10] The head of the powerful, but exiled (according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> only—the fragmentary <span style='color: blue'><b>Archon</b></span> List for 525/4 shows a <span style='color: blue'><b>Cleisthenes</b></span>, an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alcmaeonid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alcmaeonidae</b></span>, holding office in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> during this period) <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alcmaeonid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alcmaeonidae</b></span> family, <span style='color: blue'><b>Cleisthenes</b></span>, began to scheme to overthrow <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span> and return to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>.[11] In 510 BC, he persuaded the Spartan king <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span> to launch a full-scale attack on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, which succeeded in overthrowing <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span>.[11] However, in the aftermath, the other noble ('<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>eupatrid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Eupatridae</b></span>') families of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> rejected <span style='color: blue'><b>Cleisthenes</b></span>, electing <span style='color: blue'><b>Isagoras</b></span> as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>archon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archon</b></span>, with the support of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span>.[11] On a personal level, <span style='color: blue'><b>Cleisthenes</b></span> wanted to return to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>; however, he also probably wanted to prevent <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> becoming a Spartan client state. Outmaneuvering the other nobles, he proposed to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> people a radical program in which political power would be invested in the people—a "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span>".[11] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> people thus overthrew <span style='color: blue'><b>Isagoras</b></span>, repelled a Spartan attack under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span>, and invited <span style='color: blue'><b>Cleisthenes</b></span> to return to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, to put his plan into action.[12] The establishment of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span> was to radically change <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>:
<br>
<br>"And so it was that the Athenians found themselves suddenly a great power...they gave <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vivid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vivid_(band)</b></span> proof of what equality and freedom of speech might achieve"[13]
<br>
<br>The new system of government in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> opened up a wealth of opportunity for men like <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, who previously would have had no access to power.[14] Moreover, the new institutions of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span> required skills that had previously been unimportant in government. <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> was to prove himself a master of the new system; "he could infight, he could network, he could <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>spin</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spin_bowling</b></span>... and crucially, he knew how to make himself visible."[14] <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> moved to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ceramicus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kerameikos</b></span>, a down-market part of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>. This move marked him out as a 'man of the people', and allowed him to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>interact</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Interaction</b></span> more easily with ordinary citizens. He began building up a support base among these newly empowered citizens:
<br>
<br>"he wooed the poor; and they, not used to being courted, duly loved him back. Touring the taverns, the markets, the docks, canvassing where no politician had thought to canvas before, making sure never to forget a single voter's name, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> had set his eyes on a radical new constituency"[14]
<br>
<br>However, he took care to ensure that he did not alienate the nobility of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>.[14] He began to practice law, the first person in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> to prepare for public life in this way.[14] His ability as attorney and arbitrator, used in the service of the common people, gained him further popularity.[15]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> probably turned 30 in 494 BC, which qualified him to become an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>archon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archon</b></span>, the highest of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>magistracies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_magistrate</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>.[14] On the back of his popularity, he evidently decided to run for this office and was elected <span style='color: blue'><b>Archon</b></span> Eponymous, the highest government office in the following year (493 BC).[14] <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s archonship saw the beginnings of a major theme in his career; the advancement of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> sea-power. Under his guidance, the Athenians began the building of a new port at <span style='color: blue'><b>Piraeus</b></span>, to replace the existing facilities at <span style='color: blue'><b>Phalerum</b></span>.[14] Although further away from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Piraeus</b></span> offered three natural harbours, and could be easily fortified.[16] Since <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> was to become an essentially maritime power during the 5th century BC, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s policies were to have huge significance for the future of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, and indeed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. In advancing naval power, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> was probably advocating a course of action he thought essential for the long-term prospects of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>.[14] However, as <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> implies, since naval power relied on the mass mobilisation of the common citizens (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>thetes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Solonian_Constitution</b></span>) as rowers, such a policy put more power into the hands of average Athenians—and thus into <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s own hands.[16]
<br>
<br>After <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, probably in 489, <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span>, the hero of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, was seriously wounded in an abortive attempt to capture <span style='color: blue'><b>Paros</b></span>. Taking advantage of his incapacitation, the powerful <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alcmaeonid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alcmaeonidae</b></span> family arranged for him to be prosecuted.[17] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> aristocracy, and indeed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> aristocrats in general, were loath to see one person pre-eminent, and such maneuvers were commonplace.[17] <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span> was given a massive fine for the crime of 'deceiving the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> people', but died weeks later as a result of his wound.[17] In the wake of this prosecution, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> people chose to use a new institution of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span>, which had been part of <span style='color: blue'><b>Cleisthenes</b></span>'s reforms, but remained so far unused.[17] This was '<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ostracism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ostracism</b></span>'—each <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> citizen was required to write on a shard of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pottery</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_art</b></span> (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ostrakon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ostracon</b></span>) the name of a politician that they wished to see exiled for a period of ten years.[17] This may have been triggered by <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span>'s prosecution, and used by the Athenians to try and stop such power-games among the noble families.[17] Certainly, in the years (487 BC) following, the heads of the prominent families, including the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alcmaeonids</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alcmaeonidae</b></span>, were exiled.[17] The career of a politician in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> thus became fraught with more difficulty, since displeasing the population was likely to result in exile.[17]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, with his power-base firmly established among the poor, moved naturally to fill the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vacuum</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Power_vacuum</b></span> left by <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span>'s death, and in that decade became the most influential politician in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>.[17] However, the support of the nobility began to coalesce around the man who would become <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s great rival—Aristides.[18] Aristides cast himself as <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s opposite—virtuous, honest and incorruptible—and his followers called him "the just".[18] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> suggests that the rivalry between the two had begun when they competed over the love of a boy: "... they were rivals for the affection of the beautiful Stesilaus of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ceos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kea_(island)</b></span>, and were passionate beyond all moderation."[19]

<br>During the decade, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> continued to advocate the expansion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> naval power.[17] The Athenians were certainly aware throughout this period that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> interest in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> had not ended; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>'s son and successor, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>, had continued the preparations for the invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[20] <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> seems to have realised that for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> to survive the coming <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>onslaught</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Onslaught_(comics)</b></span> required a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek navy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hellenic_Navy</b></span> that could hope to face up to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> navy, and he therefore attempted to persuade the Athenians to build such a fleet.[14][17] Aristides, as champion of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>zeugites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zeugites</b></span> (the upper, 'hoplite-class') vigorously opposed such a policy.[18]
<br>
<br>In 483 BC, a massive new seam of silver was found in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> mines at <span style='color: blue'><b>Laurium</b></span>.[21] <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> proposed that the silver should be used to build a new fleet of 200 triremes, while Aristides suggested it should instead be distributed among the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> citizens.[22] <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> avoided mentioning <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, deeming that it was too distant a threat for the Athenians to act on, and instead focused their attention on <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span>.[21] At the time, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> was embroiled in a long-running war with the Aeginetans, and building a fleet would allow the Athenians to finally defeat them at sea.[21] As a result, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s motion was carried easily, although only 100 warships of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>trireme</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Trireme</b></span> type were to be built.[21] Aristides refused to countenance this; conversely <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> was not pleased that only 100 ships would be built.[22] Tension between the two camps built over the winter, so that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ostracism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ostracism</b></span> of 482 BC became a direct contest between <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> and Aristides.[22] In what has been characterized as the first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>referendum</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Referendum</b></span>, Aristides was ostracised, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s policies were endorsed.[22] Indeed, becoming aware of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> preparations for the coming invasion, the Athenians voted for the construction of more ships than <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> had initially asked for.[22] In the run up to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> had thus become the foremost politician in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>.[15]

<br>A Roman-era bust of <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, based on a 5th-century BC <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> original, in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Museo Archeologico Ostiense</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Museo_Archeologico_Ostiense</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ostia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ostia_Antica</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Rome</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Republic</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Italy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Italy</b></span>
<br>In 481 BC, a congress of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states was held, during which 30 or so[citation needed] states agreed to ally themselves against the forthcoming invasion.[23] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> and Athenians were foremost in this alliance, being sworn enemies of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[24] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> claimed the command of land forces, and since the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> (hereafter referred to as "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span>") fleet would be dominated by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> tried to claim command of the naval forces.[25] However, the other naval powers, including <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span> refused to give command to the Athenians, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> pragmatically backed down.[25] Instead, as a compromise, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> (an insignificant naval power), in the person of <span style='color: blue'><b>Eurybiades</b></span> were to command the naval forces.[26] It is clear from <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, however, that <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> would be the real leader of the fleet.[27]
<br>
<br>The 'congress' met again in the spring of 480 BC. A <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thessalian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thessaly</b></span> delegation suggested that the allies could muster in the narrow Vale of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tempe</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vale_of_Tempe</b></span>, on the borders of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thessaly</b></span>, and thereby block <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>'s advance.[28] A force of 10,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> was dispatched under the command of the Spartan <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>polemarch</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Polemarch</b></span> Euenetus and <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> to the Vale of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tempe</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vale_of_Tempe</b></span>, which they believed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army would have to pass through. However, once there, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> I of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span> warned them that the vale could be bypassed by several other passes, and that the army of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> was overwhelmingly large, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> retreated.[29] Shortly afterwards, they received the news that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> had crossed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span>.[28]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> now developed a second strategy. The route to southern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> (<span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>) would require the army of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> to travel through the very narrow pass of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>.[30] This could easily be blocked by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>, despite the overwhelming numbers of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>; furthermore, to prevent the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> bypassing <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> by sea, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and allied navies could block the straits of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span>.[30] However, after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tempe</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vale_of_Tempe</b></span> debacle, it was uncertain whether the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> would be willing to march out from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnese</b></span> again.[31] To persuade the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> to defend <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> had to show them that the Athenians were willing to do everything necessary for the success of the alliance. In short, the entire <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> fleet must be dispatched to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span>.
<br>
<br>To do this, every able-bodied <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> male would be required to man the ships. This in turn meant that the Athenians must prepare to abandon <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>.[31] Persuading the Athenians to take this course was undoubtedly one of the highlights of <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s career.[32] As <span style='color: blue'><b>Holland</b></span> has it:
<br>
<br>"What precise heights of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oratory</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Rhetoric</b></span> he attained, what stirring and memorable phrases he pronounced, we have no way of knowing...only by the effect it had on the assembly can we gauge what surely must have been its electric and vivifying quality—for <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>' <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>audacious</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Audacious-class_aircraft_carrier</b></span> proposals, when put to the vote, were ratified. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> people, facing the gravest moment of peril in their history, committed themselves once and for all to the alien element of the sea, and put their faith in a man whose ambitions many had long profoundly dreaded."[31]
<br>
<br>His proposals accepted, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> issued orders for the women and children of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> to be sent to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Troezen</b></span>, safely inside the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>.[33] He was then able to travel to a meeting of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span>, at which he proposed his strategy; with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> fleet <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>fully committed</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Becky_Mode</b></span> to the defence of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, the other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> accepted his proposals.[30]
<br>
<br>Thus, in August 480 BC, when the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army was approaching <span style='color: blue'><b>Thessaly</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> fleet sailed to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span>, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> army marched to <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>.[34] <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> himself took command of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> contingent of the fleet, and went to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span>. When the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet finally arrived at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span> after a significant delay, <span style='color: blue'><b>Eurybiades</b></span>, who both <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> suggest was not the most inspiring commander, wished to sail away without fighting.[27][35] At this point <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> accepted a large bribe from the local people for the fleet to remain at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span>, and used some of it to bribe <span style='color: blue'><b>Eurybiades</b></span> to remain, while <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pocketing</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Body_piercing</b></span> the rest.[36] From this point on, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> appears to have been more-or-less in charge of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> effort at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span>.[35] Over three days of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> held their own against the much larger <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet, but sustained significant losses.[37] However, the loss of the simultaneous Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> made their continued presence at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span> irrelevant, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> thus evacuated.[38] According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> left messages at every place where the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet might stop for drinking water, asking the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet to defect, or at least fight badly.[39] Even if this did not work, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> apparently intended that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> would at least begin to suspect the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span>, thereby sowing dissension in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> ranks.[39]
<br>
<br>In the aftermath of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span> fell to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, who then began to advance on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>.[40] The Peloponnesian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> prepared to now defend the Isthmus of <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span>, thus abandoning <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[41] From <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> fleet sailed to the island of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>, where the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> ships helped with the final evacuation of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>. The Peloponnesian contingents wanted to sail to the coast of the Isthmus to concentrate forces with the army.[42] However, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> tried to convince them to remain in the Straits of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>, invoking the lessons of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span>; "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> in close conditions works to our advantage".[42] After threatening to sail with the whole <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> people into exile in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicily</b></span>, he eventually persuaded the other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span>, whose security after all relied on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> navy, to accept his plan.[43] Therefore, even after <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> had fallen to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> navy had arrived off the coast of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> navy remained in the Straits. <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> appears to have been aiming to fight a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> that would cripple the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> navy, and thus guarantee the security of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>.[42]

<br>To bring about this <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> used a cunning mix of subterfuge and misinformation, psychologically exploiting <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>'s desire to finish the invasion.[44] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>'s actions indicate that he was keen to finish the conquest of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> in 480 BC, and to do this, he needed a decisive victory over the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> fleet.[45] <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> sent a servant, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicinnus</b></span>, to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>, with a message proclaiming that <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> was "on king's side and prefers that your affairs prevail, not the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>".[46] <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> claimed that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> commanders were infighting, that the Peloponnesians were planning to evacuate that very night, and that to gain victory all the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> needed to do was to block the straits.[46] In performing this subterfuge, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> seems to have been trying to lure the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet into the Straits.[44] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The message</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Message_(Grandmaster_Flash_and_the_Furious_Five_song)</b></span> also had a secondary purpose, namely that in the event of an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> defeat, the Athenians would probably receive some degree of mercy from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> (having indicated their readiness to submit).[44] At any rate, this was exactly the kind of news that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> wanted to hear.[44] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> evidently took the bait, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet was sent out to effect the block.[47] Perhaps overconfident and expecting no resistance, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> navy sailed into the Straits,[48] only to find that, far from disintegrating, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> navy was ready for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>.[49]
<br>
<br>According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> navy began its maneuvers, Aristides arrived at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> camp from <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span>.[50] Aristides had been recalled from exile along with the other ostracised Athenians on the order of <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, so that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> might be united against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[50] Aristides told <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet had encircled the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span>, which greatly pleased <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, as he now knew that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> had walked into his trap.[51] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> commanders seem to have taken this news rather uncomplainingly, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Holland</b></span> therefore suggests that they were party to <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s ruse all along.[52] Either way, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> prepared for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> delivered a speech to the marines before they embarked on the ships.[53] In the ensuing <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, the cramped conditions in the Straits hindered the much larger <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> navy, which became disarrayed, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> took advantage to win a famous victory.[54]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> was the turning point in the second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion, and indeed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> in general.[55] While the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> did not end the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion, it effectively ensured that all <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> would not be conquered, and allowed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> to go on the offensive in 479 BC. A number of historians believe that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> is one of the most significant battles in human history.[56][57][58] Since <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>' long-standing advocacy of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> naval power enabled the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> fleet to fight, and his stratagem brought about the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>, it is probably not an exaggeration to say, as <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> does, that <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, "...is thought to have been the man most instrumental in achieving the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>salvation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salvation</b></span> of Hellas."[21][35]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> victory at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> ended the immediate threat to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> now returned to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> with part of the army, leaving his general <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> to attempt to complete the conquest.[59] <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> wintered in <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Thessaly</b></span>, and the Athenians were thus able to return to their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>, which had been burnt and razed by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, for the winter.[60] For the Athenians, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> personally, the winter would be a testing one. The Peloponnesians refused to countenance marching north of the Isthmus to fight the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army; the Athenians tried to shame them into doing so, with no success.[61]
<br>
<br>During the winter, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> held a meeting at <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> to celebrate their success, and award prizes for achievement.[62] However, perhaps tired of the Athenians pointing out their role at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>, and of their demands for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> to march north, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> awarded the prize for civic achievement to <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span>.[61][63] Furthermore, although the admirals all voted for <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> in second place, they all voted for themselves in first place, so that no-one won the prize for individual achievement. In response, realising the importance of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> fleet to their security, and probably seeking to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>massage</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Massage</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s ego, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> brought <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>.[61][63] There, he was awarded a special prize "for his wisdom and cleverness", and won high praise from all.[63][64] Furthermore, <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> reports that at the next <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Olympic Games</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Olympic_Games</b></span>:
<br>
<br>"[when] <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> entered the stadium, the audience neglected the contestants all day long to gaze on him, and pointed him out with admiring applause to visiting strangers, so that he too was delighted, and confessed to his friends that he was now reaping in full measure the harvest of his toils in behalf of Hellas."[63]
<br>
<br>After returning to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> in the winter, <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> reports that <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> made a proposal to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> while the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet was wintering at <span style='color: blue'><b>Pagasae</b></span>:
<br>
<br>"<span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> once declared to the people [of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>] that he had devised a certain measure which could not be revealed to them, though it would be helpful and salutary for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>, and they ordered that Aristides alone should hear what it was and pass judgment on it. So <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> told Aristides that his purpose was to burn the naval station of the confederate <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, for that in this way the Athenians would be greatest, and lords of all. Then Aristides came before the people and said of the deed which <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> purposed to do, that none other could be more <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>advantageous</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Advantageous</b></span>, and none more unjust. On hearing this, the Athenians <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ordained</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bishop</b></span> that <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> cease from his purpose."[65][66]
<br>
<br>However, as happened to many prominent individuals in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s fellow citizens grew jealous of his success, and possibly tired of his boasting.[61][67] It is probable that in early 479 BC, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> was stripped of his command; instead, <span style='color: blue'><b>Xanthippus</b></span> was to command the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> fleet, and Aristides the land forces.[61][68] Though <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> was no doubt politically and militarily active for the rest of the campaign, no mention of his activities in 479 BC is made in the ancient sources.[69] In the summer of that year, after receiving an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> ultimatum, the Peloponnesians finally agreed to assemble an army and march to confront <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>, who had reoccupied <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> in June.[70] At the decisive Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> destroyed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army, while apparently on the same day, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> navy destroyed the remnants of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>.[71] These twin victories completed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> triumph, and ended the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> threat to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[71]
<br>
<br>Whatever the cause of <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s unpopularity in 479 BC, it obviously did not last long. Both Diodorus and <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> suggest he was quickly restored to the favour of the Athenians.[16][72] Indeed, after 479 BC, he seems to have enjoyed a relatively long period of popularity.[73]
<br>
<br>In the aftermath of the invasion, the Athenians began rebuilding their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> under the guidance of <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>.[16] They wished to restore the fortifications of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, but the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> objected on the grounds that no place north of the Isthmus should be left that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> could use as a fortress.[72] <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> urged the citizens to build the fortifications as quickly as possible, then went to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> as an ambassador to answer the charges levelled by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>. There, he assured them that no building work was on-going, and urged them to send emissaries to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> to see for themselves.[74] By the time the ambassadors arrived, the Athenians had finished building, and then detained the Spartan ambassadors when they complained about the presence of the fortifications.[74] By delaying in this manner, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> gave the Athenians enough time to fortify the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>, and thus ward off any Spartan attack aimed at preventing the re-fortification of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>.[74] Furthermore, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> were obliged to repatriate <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> in order to free their own ambassadors.[16][74] However, this episode may be seen as the beginning of the Spartan mistrust of <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, which would return to haunt him.[16]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> also now returned to his naval policy,[16] and more ambitious undertakings that would increase the dominant position of his native state.[75] He further extended and fortified the port complex at <span style='color: blue'><b>Piraeus</b></span>, and "fastened the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> [<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>] to the <span style='color: blue'><b>Piraeus</b></span>, and the land to the sea".[16] <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> probably aimed to make <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> the dominant naval power in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span>.[75] Indeed, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> would create the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> in 478 BC, uniting the naval power of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean Islands</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Islands</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> leadership.[76] <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> introduced tax breaks for merchants and artisans, to attract both people and trade to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> to make <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> a great mercantile centre.[77] He also instructed the Athenians to build 20 triremes per year, to ensure that their dominance in naval matters continued.[77] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> reports that <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> also secretly proposed to destroy the beached ships of the other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> navies to ensure complete naval dominance—but was <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>overruled</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Objection_(law)</b></span> by Aristides and the council of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>.[78]
<br>
<br>It seems clear that, towards the end of the decade, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> had begun to accrue enemies, and had become arrogant; moreover his fellow citizens had become jealous of his prestige and power.[16][67] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Rhodian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Rhodes</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>poet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Poetry</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Timocreon</b></span> was among his most eloquent enemies, composing slanderous drinking songs.[79] Meanwhile, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> actively worked against him, trying to promote <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span> (son of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miltiades</b></span>) as a rival to <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>. Furthermore, after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>treason</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Treason</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>disgrace</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Disgrace</b></span> of the Spartan general <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> tried to implicate <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> in the plot; he was, however, acquitted of these charges.[73] In <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> itself, he lost favour by building a sanctuary of <span style='color: blue'><b>Artemis</b></span>, with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>epithet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Epithet</b></span> Aristoboulẽ ("of good counsel") near his home, a blatant reference to his own role in delivering <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion.[67] Eventually, in either 472 or 471 BC, he was ostracised.[67][80] In itself, this did not mean that <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> had done anything wrong; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ostracism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ostracism</b></span>, in the words of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>,

<br>"was not a penalty, but a way of pacifying and alleviating that jealousy which delights to humble the eminent, breathing out its malice into this <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>disfranchisement</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Disfranchisement</b></span>."
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> first went to live in exile in <span style='color: blue'><b>Argos</b></span>.[80][81] However, perceiving that they now had a prime opportunity to bring <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> down for good, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> again levelled accusations of <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s complicity in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span>'s <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>treason</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Treason</b></span>.[80] They demanded that he be tried by the '<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Congress</span> <span style='color: green'><b>United_States_Congress</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>', rather than in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, although it seems that in the end he was actually summoned to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> to stand trial.[80][81] Perhaps realising he had little hope of surviving this trial, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> fled, first to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Kerkyra</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corfu</b></span>, and thence to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Admetus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Admetus_of_Epirus</b></span>, king of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Molossia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Molossians</b></span>.[82][83] <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s flight probably only served to convince his accusers of his guilt, and he was declared a traitor in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, his property to be confiscated.[84] It should be noted that both Diodorus and <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> considered that the charges were false, and made solely for the purposes of destroying <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>.[80][81] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> sent ambassadors to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Admetus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Admetus_of_Epirus</b></span>, threatening that the whole of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> would go to war with the <span style='color: blue'><b>Molossians</b></span> unless they surrendered <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>.[83] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Admetus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Admetus_of_Epirus</b></span>, however, allowed <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> to escape, giving him a large sum of gold to aid him on his way.[83] <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> then fled from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, apparently never to return, thus effectively bringing his political career to an end.[83][85]

<br>From <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Molossia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Molossians</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> apparently fled to <span style='color: blue'><b>Pydna</b></span>, from where he took a ship for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>.[84][85] This ship was blown off course by a storm, and ended up at <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>, which an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> fleet was in the process of besieging.[84][85] Desperate to avoid identification, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> pestered the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>captain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sea_captain</b></span> of the ship to continue the journey immediately.[84][85] According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>, who wrote within living <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>memory</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Memory</b></span> of the events, the ship eventually landed safely at <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephesus</b></span>, where <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> disembarked.[85] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> has the ship docking at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyme</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cumae</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aeolia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thessaly</b></span>,[86] and Diodorus has <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> making his way to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> in an undefined manner.[83] Diodorus and <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> next recount a similar tale, namely that <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> stayed briefly with an acquaintance (Lysitheides or Nicogenes) who was also acquainted with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> king, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia</b></span>.[83][86] Since there was a bounty on <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s head, this acquaintance devised a plan to safely convey <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> king in the type of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>covered wagon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Covered_wagon</b></span> that the King's concubines travelled in.[83][86] All three chroniclers agree that <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s next move was to contact the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> king; in <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>, this is by letter,[85] while <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> and Diodorus have a face-to-face meeting with the king.[83][86] The spirit is, however, the same in all three: <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> introduces himself to the king and seeks to enter his service:[85][87]
<br>
<br>"I, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, am come to you, who did your house more harm than any of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, when I was compelled to defend myself against your father's invasion—harm, however, far surpassed by the good that I did him during his retreat, which brought no danger for me but much for him." (<span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>)
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> say that <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> asked for a year's grace to learn the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian language</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persian_language</b></span> and customs, after which he would serve the king, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia</b></span> granted this.[85][88] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> reports that, as might be imagined, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia</b></span> was elated that such a dangerous and illustrious foe had come to serve him.<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>[89</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Effects_of_Hurricane_Sandy_in_New_York</b></span>]
<br>
<br>At some point in his travels, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s wife and children were extricated from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> by a friend, and joined him in exile.[82] His friends also managed to send him many of his belongings, although up to 100 talents worth of his goods were confiscated by the Athenians.[84] When, after a year, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> returned to the king's court, he appears to have made an immediate impact, and "he attained...very high consideration there, such as no Hellene has ever possessed before or since".[90] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> recounts that "honors he enjoyed were far beyond those paid to other foreigners; nay, he actually took part in the King's hunts and in his household diversions".[88] <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> advised the king on his dealings with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, although it seems that for a long period, the king was distracted by events elsewhere in the empire, and thus <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> "lived on for a long time without concern".[90][91] He was made governor of the district of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Magnesia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Magnesia_on_the_Maeander</b></span> on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Maeander River</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Büyük_Menderes_River</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>, and assigned the revenues of three cities: <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Magnesia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Magnesia_on_the_Maeander</b></span> (about 50 talents per year—"for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>bread</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sacramental_bread</b></span>"); <span style='color: blue'><b>Myus</b></span> ("for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>opson</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Opson</b></span>"); and <span style='color: blue'><b>Lampsacus</b></span> ("for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>wine</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Wine</b></span>").[88][90][92] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Neanthes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Neanthes_of_Cyzicus</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyzicus</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phaenias_of_Eresus</b></span> add two more, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Palaescepsis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Skepsis</b></span> ("for clothes") and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Percote</b></span> with bedding and furniture for his house.[citation needed]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> died at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Magnesia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Magnesia_on_the_Maeander</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>459 BC</span> <span style='color: green'><b>459_BC</b></span>, at the age of 65, according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>, from natural causes.[90] However, perhaps inevitably, there were also rumours surrounding his death; that finding that he could not keep the promises that he had made to the king, he committed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>suicide</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Suicide</b></span> by taking <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>poison</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Poison</b></span>, or drinking bull's <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>blood</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Blood</b></span>.[90][91][93] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> provides the most evocative version of this story:
<br>
<br>"But when <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</b></span> revolted with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> aid...and <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span>'s mastery of the sea forced the King to resist the efforts of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and to hinder their hostile growth...messages came down to <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> saying that the King commanded him to make good his promises by applying himself to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> problem; then, neither embittered by anything like anger against his former fellow-citizens, nor lifted up by the great honor and power he was to have in the war, but possibly thinking his task not even approachable, both because Hellas had other great generals at the time, and especially because <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span> was so marvelously successful in his campaigns; yet most of all out of regard for the reputation of his own achievements and the trophies of those early days; having decided that his best course was to put a fitting end to his life, he made a sacrifice to the gods, then called his friends together, gave them a farewell clasp of his hand, and, as the current story goes, drank bull's <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>blood</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Blood</b></span>, or as some say, took a quick <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>poison</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Poison</b></span>, and so died in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Magnesia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Magnesia_on_the_Maeander</b></span>, in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sixty-fifth</span> <span style='color: green'><b>65th_United_States_Congress</b></span> year of his life...They say that the King, on learning the cause and the manner of his death, admired the man yet more, and continued to treat his friends and kindred with kindness."[91]
<br>
<br>It was rumored that after his death, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s bones were transported to <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span> in accordance with his wishes, and buried in his native soil in secret, it being illegal to bury an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> traitor in <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>.[90] The Magnesians built a "splendid tomb" in their market place for <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, which still stood during the time of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>, and continued to dedicate part of their revenues to the family of <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>.[94] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> indicates that he met in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>lineal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_lineal_boxing_world_champions</b></span> descendant of <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> (also called <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>) who was still being paid these revenues, 600 years after the events in question.[94]
<br>
<br>It is possible to draw some conclusions about <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s character. Perhaps his most evident trait was his massive ambition; "In his ambition he surpassed all men";[15] "he hankered after public office rather as a man in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>delirium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delirium</b></span> might crave a cure".[14] He was proud and vain,[25] and anxious for recognition of his deeds.[95] His relationship with power was of a particularly personal nature; while he undoubtedly desired the best for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, many of his actions also seem to have been made in self-interest.[14] He also appears to have been corrupt (at least by modern standards), and was known for his fondness of bribes.[18]
<br>
<br>Yet, set against these negative traits, was an apparently natural brilliance and talent for leadership:[14]
<br>
<br>"<span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> was a man who exhibited the most indubitable signs of genius; indeed, in this particular he has a claim on our admiration quite extraordinary and unparalleled. By his own <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>native capacity</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Native_capacity</b></span>, alike unformed and unsupplemented by study, he was at once the best judge in those sudden crises which admit of little or of no deliberation, and the best <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>prophet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Muhammad</b></span> of the future, even to its most distant possibilities. An able theoretical expositor of all that came within the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sphere</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Celestial_spheres</b></span> of his practice, he was not without the power of passing an adequate judgment in matters in which he had no experience. He could also excellently divine the good and evil which lay hid in the unseen future. In fine, whether we consider the extent of his natural powers, or the slightness of his application, this extraordinary man must be allowed to have surpassed all others in the faculty of intuitively meeting an emergency."[90]
<br>Both <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Plato</b></span> record variations of an anecdote in which <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> responded with subtle sarcasm to an undistinguished man who complained that the great politician owed his fame merely to the fact that he came from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>. As <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> tells it:
<br>
<br>"Timodemus of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aphidnae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Afidnes</b></span>, who was one of <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>' enemies but not a man of note, was crazed with envy and spoke bitterly to <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> of his visit to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lacedaemon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sparta</b></span>, saying that the honors he had from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lacedaemonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sparta</b></span> were paid him for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>' sake and not for his own. This he kept saying until <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> replied, 'This is the truth of the matter: if I had been a man of Belbina I would not have been honored in this way by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, nor would you, sir, for all you are a man of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>.' Such was the end of that business."[96]
<br>As <span style='color: blue'><b>Plato</b></span> tells it, the heckler hails from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>small island</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Small_Island_(TV_film)</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Seriphus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Serifos</b></span>; <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> retorts that it is true that he would not have been famous if he had come from that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>small island</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Small_Island_(TV_film)</b></span>, but that the heckler would not have been famous either if he had been born in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>.[97]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> was undoubtedly intelligent, but also possessed natural cunning; "the workings of his mind [were] infinitely mobile and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>serpentine</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Snake</b></span>".[14] <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> was evidently sociable and appears to have enjoyed strong personal loyalty from his friends.[14][82] At any rate, it seems to have been <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s particular mix of virtues and vices that made him such an effective politician.[14]
<br>
<br>Ruins of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Themistoclean Wall</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Themistoclean_Wall</b></span> in the <span style='color: blue'><b>Kerameikos</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, named after <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> died with his reputation in tatters, a traitor to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> people; the "saviour of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>" had turned into the enemy of liberty.[98] However, his reputation in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> was rehabilitated by <span style='color: blue'><b>Pericles</b></span> in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>450s BC</span> <span style='color: green'><b>450s_BC</b></span>, and by the time <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> wrote his history, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> was once again seen as a hero.[99] <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> evidently held <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> in some esteem, and is uncharacteristically flattering in his praise for him (see above).[90] Diodorus also extensively praises <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, going as far as to offer a rationale for the length at which he discusses him: "Now on the subject of the high merits of <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, even if we have dwelt over-long on the subject in this digression, we believed it not seemly that we should leave his great ability unrecorded."[100] Indeed, Diodorus goes so far as to say that
<br>
<br>"But if any man, putting envy aside, will estimate closely not only the man's natural gifts but also his achievements, he will find that on both counts <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> holds first place among all of whom we have record. Therefore one may well be <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>amazed</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Amazed</b></span> that the Athenians were willing to rid themselves of a man of such genius."[93]
<br>
<br>Since Diodorus's history includes such luminaries as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> I the Great and <span style='color: blue'><b>Hannibal</b></span>, this is high praise indeed. <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> offers a more nuanced view of <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, with more of a critique of <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s character. He does not detract from <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s achievements, but also highlights his failings.[19]

<br>Undoubtedly the greatest achievement of <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s career was his role in the defeat of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>'s invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. Against overwhelming odds, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> survived, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>classical</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_antiquity</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek culture</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, so influential in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Western civilization</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Western_world</b></span>, was able to develop unabated.[101] Moreover, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s doctrine of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> naval power, and the establishment of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> as a major power in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> world were of enormous consequence during the 5th century BC. In 478 BC, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> alliance was reconstituted without the Peloponnesian states, into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>, in which <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> was the dominant power.[102] This was essentially a maritime alliance of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and her colonies, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean islands</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span>, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> cities. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian league</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> took the war to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, eventually invading <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> territory and dominating the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span>.[102] Under the guidance of <span style='color: blue'><b>Pericles</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian league</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> gradually evolved into the Athenian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>zenith</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zenith</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> power and influence.[103] <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> seems to have deliberately set <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> up as a rival to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> in the aftermath of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>'s invasion, basing this strategy on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> naval power (contrasted with the power of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartan army</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>).[16] Tension grew throughout the century between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, as they competed to be the leading state in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[104] Finally, in 431 BC, this tension erupted into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span>, the first of a series of conflicts that tore <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> apart for the next century; an unforeseen, if indirect, legacy of <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s.[104]

<br>Diodorus provides a rhetorical summary that reflects on <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s achievements:
<br>
<br>"What other man, while <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> still had the superior strength and the Spartan <span style='color: blue'><b>Eurybiades</b></span> held the supreme command of the fleet, could by his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>single-handed</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Single-handed_sailing</b></span> efforts have deprived <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> of that glory? Of what other man have we learned from history that by a single act he caused himself to surpass all the commanders, his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> all the other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> states, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> the barbarians? In whose term as general have the resources been more inferior and the dangers they faced greater? Who, facing the united might of all <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>, has found himself at the side of his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>
