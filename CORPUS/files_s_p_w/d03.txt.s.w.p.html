<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a>, also known as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>, historic region of southwestern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a> that is only roughly coterminous with modern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a>. The term <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> was used for centuries, chiefly in the West, to designate those regions where <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persian_language?lang=en'>Persian_language</a> and culture predominated, but it more correctly refers to a region of southern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a> formerly known as Persis, alternatively as Pārs or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persepolis?lang=en'>Persepolis</a>, modern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fars_Province?lang=en'>Fars_Province</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persepolis?lang=en'>Persepolis</a> was the name of an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indo-European_languages?lang=en'>Indo-European_languages</a> nomadic people who migrated into the region about 1000 BC. The first mention of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persepolis?lang=en'>Persepolis</a> occurs in the annals of Shalmanesar II, an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a> king, in 844 BC. During the rule of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> dynasty (559–330 BC), the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> first encountered the inhabitants of Persis on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iranian_Plateau?lang=en'>Iranian_Plateau</a>, when the Achaemenids—natives of Persis—were expanding their political <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spherical_Earth?lang=en'>Spherical_Earth</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> were the dominant dynasty during <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language?lang=en'>Greek_language</a> history until the time of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great?lang=en'>Alexander_the_Great</a>, and the use of the name <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> was gradually extended by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> and other peoples to apply to the whole <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iranian_Plateau?lang=en'>Iranian_Plateau</a>. This tendency was reinforced with the rise of the Sāsānian dynasty, also native to Persis, whose culture dominated the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iranian_Plateau?lang=en'>Iranian_Plateau</a> until the 7th century AD. The people of this area have traditionally referred to the region as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a>, Land of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indo-Iranians?lang=en'>Indo-Iranians</a>, and in 1935 the government of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a> requested that the name <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a> be used in lieu of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a>. The two terms, however, are often used interchangeably when referring to periods preceding the 20th century.
<br>
<br>This article covers the history of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iranian_peoples?lang=en'>Iranian_peoples</a> from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prehistory?lang=en'>Prehistory</a> period up to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arabs?lang=en'>Arabs</a> conquest in the 7th century AD.

<br>
<br>The early history of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a> may be divided into three phases: (1) the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prehistory?lang=en'>Prehistory</a> period, beginning with the earliest evidence of humans on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iranian_Plateau?lang=en'>Iranian_Plateau</a> (c. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/An_Unearthly_Child?lang=en'>An_Unearthly_Child</a>) and ending roughly at the start of the 1st millennium BC, (2) the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Protohistory?lang=en'>Protohistory</a> period, covering approximately the first half of the 1st millennium BC, and (3) the period of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> dynasty (6th to 4th century BC), when <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a> entered the full light of written history. The civilization of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a>, centred off the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plateau?lang=en'>Plateau</a> in lowland Khūzestān, is an exception, for written history began there as early as it did in neighbouring <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesopotamia?lang=en'>Mesopotamia</a> (c. 3000 BC).
<br>
<br>The sources for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prehistory?lang=en'>Prehistory</a> period are entirely archaeological. Early excavation in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a> was limited to a few sites. In the 1930s archaeological exploration increased, but work was abruptly halted by the outbreak of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/World_War_II?lang=en'>World_War_II</a>. After the war ended, interest in Iranian archaeology revived quickly, and, from 1950 until archaeological study was dramatically curtailed after 1979, numerous excavations revolutionized the study of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prehistory?lang=en'>Prehistory</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a>.
<br>
<br>For the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Protohistory?lang=en'>Protohistory</a> period the historian is still forced to rely primarily on archaeological evidence, but much information comes from written sources as well. None of these sources, however, is both local and contemporary in relation to the events described. Some sources are contemporary but belong to neighbouring civilizations that were only tangentially involved in events in the Iranian plateau—for example, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Akkadian_language?lang=en'>Akkadian_language</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Akkadian_language?lang=en'>Akkadian_language</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cuneiform_Records?lang=en'>Cuneiform_Records</a> from lowland <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesopotamia?lang=en'>Mesopotamia</a>. Some are local but not contemporary, such as the traditional Iranian legends and tales that supposedly speak of events in the early 1st millennium BC. And some are neither contemporary nor local but are nevertheless valuable in reconstructing events in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Protohistory?lang=en'>Protohistory</a> period (e.g., the 5th-century-BC <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> historian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>).
<br>
<br>For the study of the centuries of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> dynasty, there is sufficient documentary material so that this period is the earliest for which archaeology is not the primary source of data. Contributing to the understanding of the period are, among other sources, economic texts from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesopotamia?lang=en'>Mesopotamia</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a>; historical inscriptions such as that of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a> (the Great) at Behistun (modern Bīsotūn); contemporary and later <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_antiquity?lang=en'>Classical_antiquity</a> authors; and later Iranian legends and literature.
<br>
<br>Enigmatic evidence of human presence on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iranian_Plateau?lang=en'>Iranian_Plateau</a> as early as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lower_Paleolithic?lang=en'>Lower_Paleolithic</a> times comes from a surface find in the Bākhtarān valley. The first well-documented evidence of human habitation is in deposits from several excavated <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cave?lang=en'>Cave</a> and rock-shelter sites, located mainly in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zagros_Mountains?lang=en'>Zagros_Mountains</a> of western <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a> and dated to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Paleolithic?lang=en'>Middle_Paleolithic</a> or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mousterian?lang=en'>Mousterian</a> times (c. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/An_Unearthly_Child?lang=en'>An_Unearthly_Child</a>). There is every reason to assume, however, that future excavations will reveal <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lower_Paleolithic?lang=en'>Lower_Paleolithic</a> habitation in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mousterian?lang=en'>Mousterian</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stone_tool?lang=en'>Stone_tool</a> industry found there is generally characterized by an absence of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Levallois_technique?lang=en'>Levallois_technique</a> technique of chipping <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stone_tool?lang=en'>Stone_tool</a> and thus differs from the well-defined <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Paleolithic?lang=en'>Middle_Paleolithic</a> industries known elsewhere in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_East?lang=en'>Middle_East</a>. The economic and social level associated with this industry is that of fairly small, peripatetic <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hunter-gatherer?lang=en'>Hunter-gatherer</a> and gathering groups spread out over a thinly settled landscape.
<br>
<br>Locally, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mousterian?lang=en'>Mousterian</a> is followed by an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Upper_Paleolithic?lang=en'>Upper_Paleolithic</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stone_tool?lang=en'>Stone_tool</a> industry called the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baradostian_culture?lang=en'>Baradostian_culture</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Radiocarbon_dating?lang=en'>Radiocarbon_dating</a> suggest that this is one of the earliest <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Upper_Paleolithic?lang=en'>Upper_Paleolithic</a> complexes; it may have begun as early as 36,000 BC. Its relationship to neighbouring industries, however, remains unclear. Possibly, after some cultural and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Biological_anthropology?lang=en'>Biological_anthropology</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Continuous_function?lang=en'>Continuous_function</a>, perhaps caused by the maximum cold of the last phase of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Last_glacial_period?lang=en'>Last_glacial_period</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baradostian_culture?lang=en'>Baradostian_culture</a> was replaced by a local <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Upper_Paleolithic?lang=en'>Upper_Paleolithic</a> industry called the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zarzian_culture?lang=en'>Zarzian_culture</a>. This tool tradition, probably dating to the period 12,000 to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/10th_millennium_BC?lang=en'>10th_millennium_BC</a>, marks the end of the Iranian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paleolithic?lang=en'>Paleolithic</a> sequence.
<br>
<br>Evidence indicates that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_East?lang=en'>Middle_East</a> in general was one of the earliest areas in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_World?lang=en'>Old_World</a> to experience what the Australian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archaeology?lang=en'>Archaeology</a> V. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mike_Gordon?lang=en'>Mike_Gordon</a> Childe called the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neolithic_Revolution?lang=en'>Neolithic_Revolution</a>. That revolution witnessed the development of settled village agricultural life based firmly on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Domestication?lang=en'>Domestication</a> of plants and animals. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iran?lang=en'>Iran</a> has yielded much evidence on the history of these important developments. From the early <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neolithic?lang=en'>Neolithic</a> Period (sometimes called the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesolithic?lang=en'>Mesolithic</a>, or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesolithic?lang=en'>Mesolithic</a>) comes evidence of significant shifts in tool manufacture, settlement patterns, and subsistence methods, including the fumbling beginnings of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Domestication?lang=en'>Domestication</a> of both plants and animals, at such <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Western_Iranian_languages?lang=en'>Western_Iranian_languages</a> sites as Āsīāb, Gūrān, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ganj_Dareh?lang=en'>Ganj_Dareh</a> (Ganj Darreh), and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ali_Kosh?lang=en'>Ali_Kosh</a>. Similar developments in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zagros_Mountains?lang=en'>Zagros_Mountains</a>, on the Iraqi side of the modern border, are also traceable at sites such as Karīm Shahīr and Zawi Chemi–Shanidar. This phase of early experimentation with sedentary life and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Domestication?lang=en'>Domestication</a> was soon followed by a period of fully developed village <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Agriculture?lang=en'>Agriculture</a> as defined at important <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zagros_Mountains?lang=en'>Zagros_Mountains</a> sites such as Jarmo, Sarāb, upper <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ali_Kosh?lang=en'>Ali_Kosh</a>, and upper Gūrān. All these sites date wholly or in part to the 8th and 7th millennia BC.
<br>
<br>By approximately 6000 BC these patterns of village <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Agriculture?lang=en'>Agriculture</a> were widely spread over much of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iranian_Plateau?lang=en'>Iranian_Plateau</a> and in lowland Khūzestān. Tepe Sabz in Khūzestān, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hajji_Firuz?lang=en'>Hajji_Firuz</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Azerbaijan?lang=en'>Azerbaijan</a>, Godin III Tepe VII in northeastern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lorestan_Province?lang=en'>Lorestan_Province</a>, Tepe VII <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tepe_Sialk?lang=en'>Tepe_Sialk</a> I on the rim of the central salt desert, and Tepe VII <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yahya_Khan?lang=en'>Yahya_Khan</a> VI C–E in the southeast are all sites that have yielded evidence of fairly sophisticated patterns of agricultural life (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_numerals?lang=en'>Roman_numerals</a> identify the level of excavation). Though distinctly different, all show general cultural connections with the beginnings of settled village life in neighbouring areas such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Afghanistan?lang=en'>Afghanistan</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Balochistan?lang=en'>Balochistan</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_Asia?lang=en'>Central_Asia</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesopotamia?lang=en'>Mesopotamia</a>.
<br>
<br>Rather less is known of the cultures in this time range in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iran?lang=en'>Iran</a> than of contemporary cultures elsewhere in the ancient <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_East?lang=en'>Middle_East</a>. Research has tended to concentrate on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neolithic?lang=en'>Neolithic</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Protohistory?lang=en'>Protohistory</a> periods, and the scattered evidence for important cultural and artistic developments in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chalcolithic?lang=en'>Chalcolithic</a> Period (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chalcolithic?lang=en'>Chalcolithic</a>) and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bronze_Age?lang=en'>Bronze_Age</a> resists coherent summary. It is clear that trends that began in the late <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neolithic?lang=en'>Neolithic</a> Period continued in the millennia that followed and that the rugged, broken landscape of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iranian_Plateau?lang=en'>Iranian_Plateau</a> forced people into a variety of relatively isolated cultures. In no instance, with the important exception of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> (see The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a>, below), did <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iran?lang=en'>Iran</a> participate in the developments that led to fully urban civilization in lowland <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesopotamia?lang=en'>Mesopotamia</a> to the west or in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indus_Valley_Civilisation?lang=en'>Indus_Valley_Civilisation</a> valley to the east. Throughout <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prehistory?lang=en'>Prehistory</a> the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iranian_Plateau?lang=en'>Iranian_Plateau</a> remained at the economic and cultural level of village life achieved in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neolithic?lang=en'>Neolithic</a> Period. The separate cultural areas on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plateau?lang=en'>Plateau</a> are as yet barely understood by the modern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archaeology?lang=en'>Archaeology</a> in any terms other than through the painted <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pottery?lang=en'>Pottery</a> assemblages found at several sites throughout <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iran?lang=en'>Iran</a>. Though they developed in comparative isolation, each of these areas does yield some evidence of cultural contact with its immediate neighbours and, in some striking cases, with developments in the centres of higher civilization in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesopotamia?lang=en'>Mesopotamia</a>. Trade would appear to be the principal mechanism by which such contacts were maintained, and often <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> appears to have acted as an intermediary between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sumer?lang=en'>Sumer</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon?lang=en'>Babylon</a> on the one hand and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plateau?lang=en'>Plateau</a> cultures on the other. Trade across the northern part of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plateau?lang=en'>Plateau</a>, through the sites of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tepe_Hissar?lang=en'>Tepe_Hissar</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tepe_Sialk?lang=en'>Tepe_Sialk</a> I, most probably involved <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Transshipment?lang=en'>Transshipment</a> semiprecious stones such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lapis_lazuli?lang=en'>Lapis_lazuli</a> from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Afghanistan?lang=en'>Afghanistan</a> to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesopotamia?lang=en'>Mesopotamia</a>. The appearance of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Proto-Elamite?lang=en'>Proto-Elamite</a> tablets in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tepe_Sialk?lang=en'>Tepe_Sialk</a> IV may <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bear_Witness?lang=en'>Bear_Witness</a> to such trade. So also may the appearance of similar <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Proto-Elamite?lang=en'>Proto-Elamite</a> tablets at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tepe_Yahya?lang=en'>Tepe_Yahya</a> south of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kerman?lang=en'>Kerman</a> and in the great central desert provide evidence of trade connections between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesopotamia?lang=en'>Mesopotamia</a> and the east—in this case a trade that may have centred on specific items such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soapstone?lang=en'>Soapstone</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Copper?lang=en'>Copper</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persepolis?lang=en'>Persepolis</a> perhaps also participated in such trade networks, as is suggested by the appearance there, alongside strictly local ceramics, of wares that have clear <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesopotamia?lang=en'>Mesopotamia</a> affinities. In the west-central <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zagros_Mountains?lang=en'>Zagros_Mountains</a>, outside influences from both the north and the west can be traced in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pottery?lang=en'>Pottery</a> record; such is also the case for local cultures in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Azerbaijan?lang=en'>Azerbaijan</a> to the northwest. In general, however, these millennia represent a major dark age in Iranian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prehistory?lang=en'>Prehistory</a> and warrant considerably more attention than they have received.
<br>
<br>The beginning of this period is generally characterized by an even more marked isolation of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plateau?lang=en'>Plateau</a> than earlier, while the latter half of the period is one of major new disruptions, heretofore unique in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a>, that laid the groundwork for developments in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Protohistory?lang=en'>Protohistory</a> period. In northwestern and central western <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iran?lang=en'>Iran</a>, local cultures, as yet barely defined beyond their <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pottery?lang=en'>Pottery</a> parameters, developed in relative isolation from events elsewhere. All occupation had ceased at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tepe_Sialk?lang=en'>Tepe_Sialk</a>, but the painted <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pottery?lang=en'>Pottery</a> cultures characteristic of earlier <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hisar_district?lang=en'>Hisar_district</a> and of the sites in the Gorgān lowland in the northeast continued. Little <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesopotamia?lang=en'>Mesopotamia</a> influence is evident, though some contacts between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plateau?lang=en'>Plateau</a> remained. Beginning perhaps as early as 2400 BC but more probably somewhat later, a radical transformation occurred in the culture of the northeast: earlier painted potteries were entirely replaced by a distinctive gray or gray-black <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pottery?lang=en'>Pottery</a> associated with a variety of other artifacts, primarily weapons and ornaments in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Copper?lang=en'>Copper</a> or bronze, which were also unique. Whether this cultural change represents a strictly local development or testifies to an important intrusion of new peoples into the area is still under debate. In any case, none of these developments can be traced to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesopotamia?lang=en'>Mesopotamia</a> or to other areas to the west, regions which had previously been the sources of outside influences on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iranian_Plateau?lang=en'>Iranian_Plateau</a>. Somewhat later the local cultures of central and northwestern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a> were apparently influenced by developments in northern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesopotamia?lang=en'>Mesopotamia</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a>, along patterns of contact that had been well established in earlier periods. Yet this contact, as it is observed at Godin III, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Teppe_Hasanlu?lang=en'>Teppe_Hasanlu</a> VI, and Dinkha Tepe, did not cause any major <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dislocation?lang=en'>Dislocation</a> of local cultural patterns. In the second half of the 2nd millennium, however, western Iran—at first perhaps gradually and then with striking suddenness—came under the influence of the gray and gray-black ware cultures that had developed earlier in the northeast. There the impact of these influences was such as to definitely suggest a major cultural <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dislocation?lang=en'>Dislocation</a> and the introduction of a whole new culture—and probably a new people—into the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zagros_Mountains?lang=en'>Zagros_Mountains</a>. It was this development that marked the end of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bronze_Age?lang=en'>Bronze_Age</a> in western <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a> and ushered in the early <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Protohistory?lang=en'>Protohistory</a> period.
<br>
<br>Whereas the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iranian_Plateau?lang=en'>Iranian_Plateau</a> did not experience the rise of urban, literate civilization in the late 4th and early 3rd millennia on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesopotamia?lang=en'>Mesopotamia</a> pattern, lowland Khūzestān did. There <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> civilization was centred. Geographically, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> included more than Khūzestān; it was a combination of the lowlands and the immediate highland areas to the north and east. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> strength was based on an ability to hold these various areas together under a coordinated government that permitted the maximum interchange of the natural resources unique to each region. Traditionally this was done through a federated governmental structure.
<br>
<br>Closely related to that form of government was the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> system of inheritance and power distribution. The normal pattern of government was that of an overlord ruling over <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vassal?lang=en'>Vassal</a> princes. In earliest times the overlord lived in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susa?lang=en'>Susa</a>, which functioned as a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Islamabad?lang=en'>Islamabad</a>. With him ruled his brother closest in age, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Viceroy?lang=en'>Viceroy</a>, who usually had his seat of government in the native <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> of the currently ruling dynasty. This <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Viceroy?lang=en'>Viceroy</a> was <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heir_presumptive?lang=en'>Heir_presumptive</a> to the overlord. Yet a third official, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Regent?lang=en'>Regent</a> or prince of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susa?lang=en'>Susa</a> (the district), shared power with the overlord and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Viceroy?lang=en'>Viceroy</a>. He was usually the overlord’s son or, if no son was available, his nephew. On the death of the overlord, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Viceroy?lang=en'>Viceroy</a> became overlord. The prince of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susa?lang=en'>Susa</a> remained in office, and the brother of the old <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Viceroy?lang=en'>Viceroy</a> nearest to him in age became the new <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Viceroy?lang=en'>Viceroy</a>. Only if all brothers were dead was the prince of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susa?lang=en'>Susa</a> promoted to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Viceroy?lang=en'>Viceroy</a>, thus enabling the overlord to name his own son (or nephew) as the new prince of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susa?lang=en'>Susa</a>. Such a complicated system of governmental checks, balances, and power inheritance often broke down, despite <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bilateral_descent?lang=en'>Bilateral_descent</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Levirate_marriage?lang=en'>Levirate_marriage</a> (the compulsory marriage of a widow to her deceased husband’s brother). What is remarkable is how often the system did work; it was only in the Middle and Neo-Elamite periods that sons more often succeeded fathers to power.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> history can be divided into three main phases: the Old, Middle, and Late, or Neo-Elamite, periods. In all periods <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> was closely involved with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sumer?lang=en'>Sumer</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesopotamia?lang=en'>Mesopotamia</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a>, sometimes through peaceful trade but more often through war. In like manner, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> was often a participant in events on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iranian_Plateau?lang=en'>Iranian_Plateau</a>. Both involvements were related to the combined need of all the lowland civilizations to control the warlike peoples to the east and to exploit the economic resources of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plateau?lang=en'>Plateau</a>.
<br>
<br>
<br>The earliest kings in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> may date to approximately 2700 BC. Already conflict with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesopotamia?lang=en'>Mesopotamia</a>, in this case apparently with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Third_Dynasty_of_Ur?lang=en'>Third_Dynasty_of_Ur</a>, was characteristic of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> history. These early rulers were succeeded by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Awan_dynasty?lang=en'>Awan_dynasty</a> (Shūstar) dynasty. The 11th king of this line entered into treaty relations with the great <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naram-Sin_of_Akkad?lang=en'>Naram-Sin_of_Akkad</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Akkadian_Empire?lang=en'>Akkadian_Empire</a> (reigned c. 254–c. 2218 BC). Yet a new ruling house soon appeared, the Simash dynasty (Simash may have been in the mountains of southern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lorestan_Province?lang=en'>Lorestan_Province</a>). The outstanding event of this period was the virtual conquest of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shulgi?lang=en'>Shulgi</a> of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Third_Dynasty_of_Egypt?lang=en'>Third_Dynasty_of_Egypt</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Third_Dynasty_of_Ur?lang=en'>Third_Dynasty_of_Ur</a> (c. 2094–c. 2047 BC). Eventually the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> rose in rebellion and overthrew the 3rd <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ur?lang=en'>Ur</a> dynasty, an event long remembered in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesopotamia?lang=en'>Mesopotamia</a> dirges and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Omen?lang=en'>Omen</a> texts. About the mid 19th century BC, power in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> passed to a new dynasty, that of Eparti. The third king of this line, Shirukdukh, was active in various military coalitions against the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rising_Power?lang=en'>Rising_Power</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon?lang=en'>Babylon</a>, but <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hammurabi?lang=en'>Hammurabi</a> was not to be denied, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> was crushed in 1764 BC. The Old <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon?lang=en'>Babylon</a> kingdom, however, fell into rapid decline following the death of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hammurabi?lang=en'>Hammurabi</a>, and it was not long before the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> were able to gain revenge. Kutir-Nahhunte I attacked Samsuiluna (c. 1749–c. 1712 BC), <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hammurabi?lang=en'>Hammurabi</a>’s son, and dealt so serious a defeat to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia?lang=en'>Babylonia</a> that the event was remembered more than <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/1,000_Years?lang=en'>1,000_Years</a> later in an inscription of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a> king <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ashurbanipal?lang=en'>Ashurbanipal</a>. It may be assumed that with this <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stroke?lang=en'>Stroke</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> once again gained independence. The end of the Eparti dynasty, which occurred possibly in the late 16th century BC, is buried in silence.
<br>
<br>After two centuries for which sources reveal nothing, the Middle <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> period opened with the rise to power of the Anzanite dynasty, whose homeland probably lay in the mountains northeast of modern Khūzestān. Political expansion under Khumbannumena (c. 1285–c. 1266 BC), the fourth king of this line, proceeded apace, and his successes were commemorated by his assumption of the title Expander of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire?lang=en'>Empire</a>. He was succeeded by his son, Untash-Gal (Untash [d] Gal, or Untash-Huban), a contemporary of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shalmaneser_I?lang=en'>Shalmaneser_I</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a> (c. 1274–c. 1245 BC) and the founder of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> of Dūr Untash (modern Choghā Zanbīl). In the years immediately following Untash-Gal’s reign, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> increasingly found itself in real or potential conflict with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rising_Power?lang=en'>Rising_Power</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tukulti-Ninurta_I?lang=en'>Tukulti-Ninurta_I</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a> campaigned in the mountains north of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> in the latter part of the 13th century BC. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> under Kidin-Khutran, the second king after Untash-Gal, countered with a successful and devastating raid on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia?lang=en'>Babylonia</a>. In the end, however, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a> power seems to have been too great. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tukulti-Ninurta_I?lang=en'>Tukulti-Ninurta_I</a> managed to expand, for a brief time, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a> control well to the south in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesopotamia?lang=en'>Mesopotamia</a>. Kidin-Khutran faded into obscurity, and the Anzanite dynasty came to an end.
<br>
<br>After a short period of dynastic troubles, the second half of the Middle <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> period opened with the reign of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shutruk-Nakhunte?lang=en'>Shutruk-Nakhunte</a> I (c. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/1160s_BC?lang=en'>1160s_BC</a>). Two equally powerful and two rather less impressive kings followed this founder of a new dynasty, whose home was probably <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susa?lang=en'>Susa</a>, and in this period <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> became one of the great military powers of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_East?lang=en'>Middle_East</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tukulti-Ninurta_I?lang=en'>Tukulti-Ninurta_I</a> died about 1208 BC, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a> fell into a period of internal weakness and dynastic conflict. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> was quick to take advantage of this situation by campaigning extensively in the Diyālā River area and into the very heart of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesopotamia?lang=en'>Mesopotamia</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shutruk-Nakhunte?lang=en'>Shutruk-Nakhunte</a> I captured <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon?lang=en'>Babylon</a> and carried off to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susa?lang=en'>Susa</a> the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stele?lang=en'>Stele</a> on which was inscribed the famous law code of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hammurabi?lang=en'>Hammurabi</a>. Shilkhak-In-Shushinak, brother and successor of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shutruk-Nakhunte?lang=en'>Shutruk-Nakhunte</a>’s eldest son, Kutir-Nahhunte I, still anxious to take advantage of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a> weakness, campaigned as far north as the area of modern Kirkūk. In <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia?lang=en'>Babylonia</a>, however, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Second_Dynasty_of_Egypt?lang=en'>Second_Dynasty_of_Egypt</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isin?lang=en'>Isin</a> led a native revolt against such control as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> had been able to exercise there, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> power in central <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesopotamia?lang=en'>Mesopotamia</a> was eventually broken. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> military empire began to shrink rapidly. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nebuchadnezzar_II?lang=en'>Nebuchadnezzar_II</a> I of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neo-Babylonian_Empire?lang=en'>Neo-Babylonian_Empire</a> (c. 1119–c. 1098 BC) attacked <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> and was just barely thwarted. A second <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neo-Babylonian_Empire?lang=en'>Neo-Babylonian_Empire</a> attack succeeded, however, and the whole of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> was apparently overrun, ending the Middle <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> period.
<br>
<br>It is noteworthy that during the Middle <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> period the old system of succession to, and distribution of, power appears to have broken down. Increasingly, son succeeded father, and less is heard of divided authority within a federated system. This probably reflects an effort to increase the central authority at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susa?lang=en'>Susa</a> in order to conduct effective military campaigns abroad and to hold <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> foreign conquests. The old system of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dialect?lang=en'>Dialect</a> balanced with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Federalism?lang=en'>Federalism</a> must have suffered, and the fraternal, sectional strife that so weakened <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> in the Neo-Elamite period may have had its roots in the centrifugal developments of the 13th and 12th centuries BC.
<br>
<br>A long period of darkness separates the Middle and Neo-Elamite periods. In 742 BC a certain Huban-Nugash is mentioned as king in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a>. The land appears to have been divided into separate principalities, with the central power fairly weak. During the next century the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> constantly attempted to interfere in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesopotamia?lang=en'>Mesopotamia</a> affairs, usually in alliance with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon?lang=en'>Babylon</a>, against the constant pressure of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a> expansion. At times they were successful with this policy, both militarily and diplomatically, but on the whole they were forced to give way to increasing <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a> power. Local <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> dynastic troubles were from time to time compounded by both <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia?lang=en'>Babylonia</a> interference. Meanwhile the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a> army whittled away at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> power and influence in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Luristan_bronze?lang=en'>Luristan_bronze</a>. In time these internal and external pressures produced a near total collapse of any meaningful central authority in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a>. In an effort to clean up a political and diplomatic mess that had become a chronic <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Headache?lang=en'>Headache</a> for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ashurbanipal?lang=en'>Ashurbanipal</a>’s armies mounted a series of campaigns between 692 and 639 BC that utterly destroyed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susa?lang=en'>Susa</a>, pulling down buildings, looting, and sowing the land of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> with salt.
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Protohistory?lang=en'>Protohistory</a> period and the kingdom of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a>
<br>The beginning of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Near_East?lang=en'>Ancient_Near_East</a> is marked by major dislocations of cultural and historical patterns in western <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a> (almost nothing is known of the eastern half of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plateau?lang=en'>Plateau</a> in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Near_East?lang=en'>Ancient_Near_East</a>). The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Near_East?lang=en'>Ancient_Near_East</a> itself is divided into three periods: <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Near_East?lang=en'>Ancient_Near_East</a> I (c. 1300–c. 1000 BC), <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Near_East?lang=en'>Ancient_Near_East</a> II (c. 1000–c. 800/750 BC), and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron_Age?lang=en'>Iron_Age</a> (c. 750–c. 550 BC). The latter is the archaeological equivalent of what historically can be called the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Median_language?lang=en'>Median_language</a> period.
<br>
<br>Though isolated groups of speakers of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indo-European_languages?lang=en'>Indo-European_languages</a> had appeared and disappeared in western <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a> in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/2nd_millennium_BC?lang=en'>2nd_millennium_BC</a>, it was during the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Near_East?lang=en'>Ancient_Near_East</a> that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indo-European_languages?lang=en'>Indo-European_languages</a> Iranians rose to be the dominant force on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plateau?lang=en'>Plateau</a>. By the mid-9th century BC two major groups of Iranians appeared in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cuneiform_script?lang=en'>Cuneiform_script</a> sources: the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>. Of the two the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> were the more widespread and, from an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neo-Assyrian_Empire?lang=en'>Neo-Assyrian_Empire</a> point of view, the more important group. When <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neo-Assyrian_Empire?lang=en'>Neo-Assyrian_Empire</a> armies raided as far east as modern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hamadan?lang=en'>Hamadan</a>, they found only <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a>. In the more western <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zagros_Mountains?lang=en'>Zagros_Mountains</a> they encountered <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> mixed with non-Iranian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indigenous_peoples?lang=en'>Indigenous_peoples</a>. Early in the 1st millennium Iranian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> already controlled almost all of the eastern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zagros_Mountains?lang=en'>Zagros_Mountains</a> and were infiltrating, if not actually pushing steadily into, the western <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zagros_Mountains?lang=en'>Zagros_Mountains</a>, in some areas right up to the edge of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plateau?lang=en'>Plateau</a> and to the borders of lowland <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesopotamia?lang=en'>Mesopotamia</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persian_people?lang=en'>Persian_people</a> also appear in roughly the same areas, though their exact location remains controversial. At times they seem to have settled in the north near Lake <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lake_Urmia?lang=en'>Lake_Urmia</a>, at times in the central western <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zagros_Mountains?lang=en'>Zagros_Mountains</a> near modern Kermānshāh, later certainly in the southwestern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zagros_Mountains?lang=en'>Zagros_Mountains</a> somewhere near the borders of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a>, and eventually, of course, in the region of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fars_Province?lang=en'>Fars_Province</a>. It has been argued that these various locations represent a nomadic tribe on the move; more likely they represent more than one group of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persian_people?lang=en'>Persian_people</a>. What is reasonably clear from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cuneiform_script?lang=en'>Cuneiform_script</a> sources is that these <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persian_people?lang=en'>Persian_people</a> (and no doubt other <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iranian_peoples?lang=en'>Iranian_peoples</a> not identified by name) were moving into western <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iran?lang=en'>Iran</a> from the east. They probably followed routes along the southern face of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alborz?lang=en'>Alborz</a> and, as they entered the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zagros_Mountains?lang=en'>Zagros_Mountains</a>, spread out to the northwest and southeast following the natural topography of the mountains. Where they could, they infiltrated farther west—for example, along the major pass across the mountains from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hamadan?lang=en'>Hamadan</a> to Kermānshāh. In doing so, they met resistance from the local settled populations, who often appealed to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Urartu?lang=en'>Urartu</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> for assistance in holding back the newcomers. Such appeals were, of course, most welcome to these great powers, who were willing to take advantage of the situation both to advance their interests at each other’s expense and to control the Iranian threat to themselves.
<br>
<br>It has been suggested that the introduction of gray and gray-black <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pottery?lang=en'>Pottery</a> into western <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iran?lang=en'>Iran</a> from the northeast, which signals the start of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron_Age?lang=en'>Iron_Age</a>, is the archaeological manifestation of this pattern of a gradual movement of Iranians from east to west. The case is by no means proved, but it is a reasonable reading of the combined evidence. If it is so, then the earliest Iranians in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zagros_Mountains?lang=en'>Zagros_Mountains</a> can be dated to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron_Age?lang=en'>Iron_Age</a> I times, about 1300 BC. Archaeologically, the culture of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron_Age?lang=en'>Iron_Age</a> II times can be seen as having evolved out of that of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron_Age?lang=en'>Iron_Age</a> I period, and, though the development is less clear, the same can be said of the relationship between the cultures of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron_Age?lang=en'>Iron_Age</a> II and III. The spread of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron_Age?lang=en'>Iron_Age</a> I and II cultures in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zagros_Mountains?lang=en'>Zagros_Mountains</a> is restricted and would appear to correspond fairly well with the distribution of Iranians known from the written documents. The distribution of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron_Age?lang=en'>Iron_Age</a> culture, on the other hand, is, at least by the 7th century BC, much more widespread and covers almost the whole of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zagros_Mountains?lang=en'>Zagros_Mountains</a>. Thus, the argument that links these archaeological patterns with the Iranian migration into the area associates the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Near_East?lang=en'>Ancient_Near_East</a> I and II cultures with the early penetration of the Iranians into the more eastern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zagros_Mountains?lang=en'>Zagros_Mountains</a> and with their infiltration westward along the major routes crosscutting the main <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mountain?lang=en'>Mountain</a> alignments. Those areas where traces of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Near_East?lang=en'>Ancient_Near_East</a> I and II cultures do not appear were the regions still under the control of non-Iranian indigenous groups supported by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Urartu?lang=en'>Urartu</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a>. The widespread <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron_Age?lang=en'>Iron_Age</a> culture is then associated with the rise to power of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> kingdom in the 7th and early 6th centuries BC and the Iranianization of the whole of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zagros_Mountains?lang=en'>Zagros_Mountains</a>.
<br>
<br>Traditionally, the creator of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> kingdom was one <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deioces?lang=en'>Deioces</a>, who, according to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, reigned from 728 to 675 BC and founded the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> capital <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ecbatana?lang=en'>Ecbatana</a> (modern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hamadan?lang=en'>Hamadan</a>). Attempts have been made to associate Dāiukku, a local <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zagros_Mountains?lang=en'>Zagros_Mountains</a> king mentioned in a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cuneiform_script?lang=en'>Cuneiform_script</a> text as one of the captives deported to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a> by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sargon_II?lang=en'>Sargon_II</a> in 714 BC, with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deioces?lang=en'>Deioces</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, but such an association is highly unlikely. To judge from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neo-Assyrian_Empire?lang=en'>Neo-Assyrian_Empire</a> sources, no <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> kingdom such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> describes for the reign of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deioces?lang=en'>Deioces</a> existed in the early 7th century BC; at best, he is reporting a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> legend of the founding of their kingdom.
<br>
<br>According to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deioces?lang=en'>Deioces</a> was succeeded by his son <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phraortes?lang=en'>Phraortes</a> (reigned 675–653 BC), who subjugated the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persian_people?lang=en'>Persian_people</a> and lost his life in a premature attack against the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neo-Assyrian_Empire?lang=en'>Neo-Assyrian_Empire</a>. Some of this tale may be true. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neo-Assyrian_Empire?lang=en'>Neo-Assyrian_Empire</a> texts speak of a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kashtariti?lang=en'>Kashtariti</a> as the leader of a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaebol?lang=en'>Chaebol</a> group of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythians?lang=en'>Scythians</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mannaeans?lang=en'>Mannaeans</a>, and miscellaneous other local <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zagros_Mountains?lang=en'>Zagros_Mountains</a> peoples that seriously threatened the peace of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neo-Assyrian_Empire?lang=en'>Neo-Assyrian_Empire</a>’s eastern borderlands during the reign of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Esarhaddon?lang=en'>Esarhaddon</a> (680–669 BC). It is possible that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phraortes?lang=en'>Phraortes</a> is this <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kashtariti?lang=en'>Kashtariti</a>, though the suggestion cannot be proved either historically or linguistically. That a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> king in this period exerted political and military control over the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persian_people?lang=en'>Persian_people</a> is entirely reasonable, though it cannot be proved.
<br>
<br>Beginning as early as the 9th century BC and with increasing impact in the late 8th and early 7th centuries, groups of nomadic warriors entered western <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a>, probably from across the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caucasus?lang=en'>Caucasus</a>. Dominant among these groups were the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythians?lang=en'>Scythians</a>, and their entrance into the affairs of the western <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plateau?lang=en'>Plateau</a> during the 7th century may perhaps mark one of the turning points in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron_Age?lang=en'>Iron_Age</a> history. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> speaks in some detail of a period of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythians?lang=en'>Scythians</a> domination, the so-called <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythians?lang=en'>Scythians</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Interregnum?lang=en'>Interregnum</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> dynasty history. His dating of this event remains uncertain, but traditionally it is seen as falling between the reigns of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phraortes?lang=en'>Phraortes</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyaxares?lang=en'>Cyaxares</a> and covering the years 653 to 625 BC. Whether such an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Interregnum?lang=en'>Interregnum</a> ever actually occurred and, if it did, whether it should not be dated later than this are open questions. What is clear is that by the mid 7th century BC there were a great many <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythians?lang=en'>Scythians</a> in western <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a>, that they—along with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> and other groups—posed a serious threat to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a>, and that their appearance threw previous power alignments quite out of balance.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> reports how, under <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyaxares?lang=en'>Cyaxares</a> of Media (625–585 BC), the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythians?lang=en'>Scythians</a> were overthrown when their kings were induced at a supper party to get so drunk that they were then easily slain. It is more likely that about this time either the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythians?lang=en'>Scythians</a> withdrew voluntarily from western <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a> and went off to plunder elsewhere or they were simply absorbed into a rapidly developing confederation under <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hegemony?lang=en'>Hegemony</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyaxares?lang=en'>Cyaxares</a> is a fully historical figure who appears in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cuneiform_script?lang=en'>Cuneiform_script</a> sources as Uvakhshatra. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> speaks of how <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyaxares?lang=en'>Cyaxares</a> reorganized the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> army into units built around specialized armaments: spearmen, archers, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>Cavalry</a>. The unified and reorganized <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> were a match for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a>. They attacked one of the important <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a> border cities, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arrapha?lang=en'>Arrapha</a>, in 615 BC, surrounded <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nineveh?lang=en'>Nineveh</a> in 614 but were unable to capture it, and instead successfully stormed the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Religious_capital?lang=en'>Religious_capital</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assur?lang=en'>Assur</a>. An alliance between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia?lang=en'>Babylonia</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> was sealed by the betrothal of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyaxares?lang=en'>Cyaxares</a>’ granddaughter to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia?lang=en'>Babylonia</a> King <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nabopolassar?lang=en'>Nabopolassar</a>’s son, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nebuchadnezzar_II?lang=en'>Nebuchadnezzar_II</a> II (605–562 BC). In 612 the attack on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nineveh?lang=en'>Nineveh</a> was renewed, and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> fell in late August (the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia?lang=en'>Babylonia</a> arrived rather too late to participate fully in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a>). The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia?lang=en'>Babylonia</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> together pursued the fleeing <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a> westward into <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eber-Nari?lang=en'>Eber-Nari</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a> appeals to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a> for help came to naught, and the last <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a> ruler, Ashur-uballiṭ II, disappeared from history in 609.
<br>
<br>The problem, of course, was how to divide the spoils among the victors. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cuneiform_script?lang=en'>Cuneiform_script</a> sources are comparatively <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silent_film?lang=en'>Silent_film</a>, but it would seem that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia?lang=en'>Babylonia</a> fell heir to all of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a> holdings within the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fertile_Crescent?lang=en'>Fertile_Crescent</a>, while their allies took over all of the highland areas. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> gained control over the lands in eastern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a> that had once been part of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Urartu?lang=en'>Urartu</a> and eventually became embroiled in war with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lydians?lang=en'>Lydians</a>, the dominant political power in western <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a>. In 585 BC, probably through the mediation of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia?lang=en'>Babylonia</a>, peace was established between Media and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lydia?lang=en'>Lydia</a>, and the Halys (Kızıl) River was fixed as the boundary between the two kingdoms. Thus a new balance of power was established in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_East?lang=en'>Middle_East</a> among <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lydians?lang=en'>Lydians</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia?lang=en'>Babylonia</a>, and, far to the south, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a>. At his death <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyaxares?lang=en'>Cyaxares</a> controlled vast territories: all of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a> to the Halys; the whole of western <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a> eastward, perhaps as far as the area of modern Tehrān; and all of southwestern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a>, including <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fars_Province?lang=en'>Fars_Province</a>. Whether it is appropriate to call these holdings a kingdom is debatable; one suspects that authority over the various peoples, Iranian and non-Iranian, who occupied these territories was exerted in the form of a confederation such as is implied by the ancient Iranian royal title, king of kings.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Astyages?lang=en'>Astyages</a> followed his father, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyaxares?lang=en'>Cyaxares</a>, on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> throne (585–550 BC). Comparatively little is known of his reign. All was not well with the alliance with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon?lang=en'>Babylon</a>, and there is some evidence to suggest that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia?lang=en'>Babylonia</a> may have feared <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> power. The latter, however, was soon in no position to threaten others, for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Astyages?lang=en'>Astyages</a> was himself under attack. Indeed, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Astyages?lang=en'>Astyages</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> were soon overthrown by the rise to power in the Iranian world of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Great?lang=en'>Cyrus_the_Great</a> (the Great) of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>.
<br>
<br>The ruling dynasty of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> that was settled in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fars_Province?lang=en'>Fars_Province</a> in southwestern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a> (possibly the Parsumash of the later <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a> records) traced its ancestry back to an eponymous ancestor, Hāxamanish, or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenes?lang=en'>Achaemenes</a>. There is no historical evidence of such a king’s existence. Traditionally, three rulers fell between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenes?lang=en'>Achaemenes</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Great?lang=en'>Cyrus_the_Great</a>: <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Teispes?lang=en'>Teispes</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_I?lang=en'>Cyrus_I</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_I?lang=en'>Cambyses_I</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Teispes?lang=en'>Teispes</a>, freed of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> domination during the so-called <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythians?lang=en'>Scythians</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Interregnum?lang=en'>Interregnum</a>, is thought to have expanded his kingdom and to have divided it on his death between his two sons, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_I?lang=en'>Cyrus_I</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ariaramnes?lang=en'>Ariaramnes</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_I?lang=en'>Cyrus_I</a> may have been the king of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> who appears in the records of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ashurbanipal?lang=en'>Ashurbanipal</a> swearing allegiance to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a> after the devastation of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a> in the campaigns of 642–639 BC, though there are chronological problems involved with this equation. When <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> control over the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> was supposedly reasserted under <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyaxares?lang=en'>Cyaxares</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_I?lang=en'>Cambyses_I</a> is thought to have been given a reunited <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> to administer as a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vassal?lang=en'>Vassal</a>. His son, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Great?lang=en'>Cyrus_the_Great</a>, married the daughter of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Astyages?lang=en'>Astyages</a> and in 559 inherited his father’s position within the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> confederation.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Great?lang=en'>Cyrus_the_Great</a> certainly warranted his later title, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Great?lang=en'>Cyrus_the_Great</a> the Great. He must have been a remarkable personality, and certainly he was a remarkable king. He united under his authority several <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> and Iranian groups who apparently had not been under his father’s control. He then initiated diplomatic exchanges with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nabonidus?lang=en'>Nabonidus</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon?lang=en'>Babylon</a> (556–539 BC), which justifiably worried <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Astyages?lang=en'>Astyages</a>. Eventually he openly rebelled against the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a>, who were beaten in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a> when considerable numbers of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> troops deserted to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> standard. Thus in 550 the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> became the first <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> empire, and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> kings appeared on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_law?lang=en'>International_law</a> scene with a suddenness that must have frightened many.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Great?lang=en'>Cyrus_the_Great</a> immediately set out to expand his conquests. After apparently convincing the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia?lang=en'>Babylonia</a> that they had nothing to fear from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>, he turned against the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lydia?lang=en'>Lydia</a> under the rule of the fabulously wealthy <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Croesus?lang=en'>Croesus</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lydia?lang=en'>Lydia</a> appeals to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon?lang=en'>Babylon</a> were to no <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Avail?lang=en'>Avail</a>. He then took <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cilicia?lang=en'>Cilicia</a>, thus cutting the routes over which any help might have reached the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lydia?lang=en'>Lydia</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Croesus?lang=en'>Croesus</a> attacked, and an indecisive <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a> was fought in 547 BC on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kızılırmak_River?lang=en'>Kızılırmak_River</a>. Since it was late in the campaigning season, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lydia?lang=en'>Lydia</a> thought the war was over for that year, returned to their capital at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sardis?lang=en'>Sardis</a>, and dispersed the national levy. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Great?lang=en'>Cyrus_the_Great</a>, however, kept coming. He caught and besieged the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lydia?lang=en'>Lydia</a> in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Citadel?lang=en'>Citadel</a> at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sardis?lang=en'>Sardis</a> and captured <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Croesus?lang=en'>Croesus</a> in 546. Of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> city-states along the western coast of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a>, heretofore under <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lydia?lang=en'>Lydia</a> control, only <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a> surrendered without a fight. The others were systematically reduced by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> armies led by subordinate generals. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Great?lang=en'>Cyrus_the_Great</a> himself was apparently busy elsewhere, possibly in the east, for little is known of his activities between the capture of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sardis?lang=en'>Sardis</a> and the beginning of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neo-Babylonian_Empire?lang=en'>Neo-Babylonian_Empire</a> campaign in 540.
<br>
<br>Nowhere did <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Great?lang=en'>Cyrus_the_Great</a> display his political and military genius better than in the conquest of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neo-Babylonian_Empire?lang=en'>Neo-Babylonian_Empire</a>. The campaign actually began when he lulled the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neo-Babylonian_Empire?lang=en'>Neo-Babylonian_Empire</a> into inactivity during his war with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lydia?lang=en'>Lydia</a>, which, since it was carried to a successful conclusion, deprived the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neo-Babylonian_Empire?lang=en'>Neo-Babylonian_Empire</a> of a potential ally when their turn came. Then he took full advantage of internal disaffection and discontent within <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neo-Babylonian_Empire?lang=en'>Neo-Babylonian_Empire</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nabonidus?lang=en'>Nabonidus</a> was not a popular king: he had paid too little attention to home affairs and had alienated the native <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neo-Babylonian_Empire?lang=en'>Neo-Babylonian_Empire</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Priest?lang=en'>Priest</a>. The writer of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Book_of_Isaiah?lang=en'>Book_of_Isaiah</a>, speaking for many of the captive <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jews?lang=en'>Jews</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neo-Babylonian_Empire?lang=en'>Neo-Babylonian_Empire</a>, undoubtedly represented the hopes of many of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nabonidus?lang=en'>Nabonidus</a>’s subjects that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Great?lang=en'>Cyrus_the_Great</a> was a potential deliverer. With the stage thus set, the military campaign against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon?lang=en'>Babylon</a> came almost as an anticlimax. The fall of the greatest <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_East?lang=en'>Middle_East</a> was swift; <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Great?lang=en'>Cyrus_the_Great</a> marched into town in the late summer of 539 BC, seized the hands of the statue of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tutelary_deity?lang=en'>Tutelary_deity</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marduk?lang=en'>Marduk</a> as a signal of his willingness to rule as a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon?lang=en'>Babylon</a> and not as a foreign conqueror, and was hailed by many as the legitimate successor to the throne. In one stride <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Great?lang=en'>Cyrus_the_Great</a> carried <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> power to the borders of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a>, for with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon?lang=en'>Babylon</a> came all that it had seized from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria?lang=en'>Assyria</a> and gained in the sequel.
<br>
<br>Little is known of the remainder of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Great?lang=en'>Cyrus_the_Great</a>’s reign. The rapidity with which his son and successor, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_II?lang=en'>Cambyses_II</a>, initiated a successful campaign against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a> suggests that preparations for such an attack were well advanced under <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Great?lang=en'>Cyrus_the_Great</a>. But the founder of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> power was forced to turn east late in his reign to protect that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frontier?lang=en'>Frontier</a> against warlike tribes who were themselves in part Iranians and who threatened the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plateau?lang=en'>Plateau</a> in the same manner as had the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> more than a millennium earlier. One of the recurrent themes of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a> is the threat of peoples from the east. How much <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Great?lang=en'>Cyrus_the_Great</a> conquered in the east is uncertain. What is clear is that he lost his life in 529 BC, fighting somewhere in the region of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amu_Darya?lang=en'>Amu_Darya</a> (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amu_Darya?lang=en'>Amu_Darya</a>) and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syr_Darya?lang=en'>Syr_Darya</a> (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syr_Darya?lang=en'>Syr_Darya</a>) rivers.
<br>
<br>On the death of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Great?lang=en'>Cyrus_the_Great</a> the Great, the empire passed to his son, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_II?lang=en'>Cambyses_II</a> (reigned 529–522 BC). There may have been some degree of unrest throughout the empire at the time of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Great?lang=en'>Cyrus_the_Great</a>’s death, for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_II?lang=en'>Cambyses_II</a> apparently felt it necessary to secretly kill his brother, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bardiya?lang=en'>Bardiya</a> (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bardiya?lang=en'>Bardiya</a>), in order to protect his rear while leading the campaign against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a> in 525. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pharaoh?lang=en'>Pharaoh</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amasis_II?lang=en'>Amasis_II</a> of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Twenty-sixth_Dynasty_of_Egypt?lang=en'>Twenty-sixth_Dynasty_of_Egypt</a> sought to shore up his defenses by hiring <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language?lang=en'>Greek_language</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mercenary?lang=en'>Mercenary</a> but was betrayed by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_II?lang=en'>Cambyses_II</a> successfully managed to cross the hostile <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sinai_Peninsula?lang=en'>Sinai_Peninsula</a>, traditionally <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a>’s first and strongest line of defense, and brought the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a> under <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Psamtik_III?lang=en'>Psamtik_III</a>, son and successor of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amasis_II?lang=en'>Amasis_II</a>, to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a> at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pelusium?lang=en'>Pelusium</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a> lost and retired to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memphis_Tigers_men's_basketball?lang=en'>Memphis_Tigers_men's_basketball</a>, which subsequently fell to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>. Three subsidiary campaigns were then mounted, all of which are reported as failures: one against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carthage?lang=en'>Carthage</a>, though the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phoenicia?lang=en'>Phoenicia</a> sailors, who were the backbone of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> navy, declined to sail against their own <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colonies_in_antiquity?lang=en'>Colonies_in_antiquity</a>; one against the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oasis?lang=en'>Oasis</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amun?lang=en'>Amun</a> (in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a> desert west of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nile_Delta?lang=en'>Nile_Delta</a>), which, according to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, was defeated by a massive <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dust_storm?lang=en'>Dust_storm</a>; and one led by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_II?lang=en'>Cambyses_II</a> himself to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nubia?lang=en'>Nubia</a>. This latter effort was partly successful, but the army suffered badly from a lack of proper provisions on the return march. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ptolemaic_Kingdom?lang=en'>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</a> was then garrisoned at three major points: Daphnae in the east delta, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memphis_Tigers_men's_basketball?lang=en'>Memphis_Tigers_men's_basketball</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elephantine?lang=en'>Elephantine</a>, where <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jews?lang=en'>Jews</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mercenary?lang=en'>Mercenary</a> formed the main body of troops.
<br>
<br>In 522 BC news reached <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_II?lang=en'>Cambyses_II</a> of a revolt in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a> led by an impostor claiming to be <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bardiya?lang=en'>Bardiya</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_II?lang=en'>Cambyses_II</a>’ brother. Several provinces of the empire accepted the new ruler, who bribed his subjects by remitting taxes for three years. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_II?lang=en'>Cambyses_II</a> died—possibly by his own hand but more probably from infection following an accidental <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sword?lang=en'>Sword</a> wound—as he hastened home to regain control. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a>, a leading general in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_II?lang=en'>Cambyses_II</a>’ army and one of the princes of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> family, raced homeward with the troops in order to crush the rebellion in a manner profitable to himself.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_II?lang=en'>Cambyses_II</a> has been rather <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mistreated_(song)?lang=en'>Mistreated_(song)</a> in the sources, partly because of the prejudices of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>’s <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a> informers and partly because of the propagandist motives of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_II?lang=en'>Cambyses_II</a> is reported to have ruled the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a> harshly and to have desecrated their religious ceremonies and shrines. His military campaigns out of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a> were all reported as failures. He was accused of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suicide?lang=en'>Suicide</a> in the face of revolt at home. It was even suggested that he was mad. There is, however, little solid contemporary evidence to support these charges.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a>, called the Great, tells in detail the story of the overthrow of the false <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bardiya?lang=en'>Bardiya</a> and of the first year of his own rule in his famous royal inscription cut on a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rock_music?lang=en'>Rock_music</a> face at the base of Mount Bīsotūn, a few miles east of modern Kermānshāh. Some historians consider <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a>’s account to be mere <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Propaganda?lang=en'>Propaganda</a> and argue instead that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bardiya?lang=en'>Bardiya</a> was not an imposter. According to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a>, six leading <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> nobles assisted in slaying the imposter and together proclaimed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a> the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rightful_Heir?lang=en'>Rightful_Heir</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_II?lang=en'>Cambyses_II</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a> was a member of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> royal house. His great-grandfather was <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ariaramnes?lang=en'>Ariaramnes</a>, son of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Teispes?lang=en'>Teispes</a>, who had shared power in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> with his brother <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_I?lang=en'>Cyrus_I</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ariaramnes?lang=en'>Ariaramnes</a>’ son, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arsames?lang=en'>Arsames</a>, and his grandson, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vishtaspa?lang=en'>Vishtaspa</a> (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a>’s father), had not been kings in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>, as unified royal power had been placed in the hands of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_I?lang=en'>Cambyses_I</a> by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyaxares?lang=en'>Cyaxares</a>. Neither is named a king in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a>’s own inscriptions. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vishtaspa?lang=en'>Vishtaspa</a> was, however, an important royal prince and apparently the governor of Persis. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a> himself was in the mold of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_I?lang=en'>Cyrus_I</a> the Great—a powerful personality and a dynamic ruler.
<br>
<br>It took more than a year (522–521 BC) of hard fighting to put down the revolts associated with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bardiya?lang=en'>Bardiya</a>’s claim to the throne and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a>’s succession to power. Almost every province of the empire was involved in the conflict, including <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> and, most particularly, Media. A balanced policy of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pardon?lang=en'>Pardon</a> backed by the swift and thorough punishment of any captured rebel leader, in combination with a well-coordinated and carefully timed distribution of loyal forces, eventually brought peace to the empire and undisputed power to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a>. He then turned his attention to the organization and consolidation of his inheritance, and it was for this role—that of lawgiver and organizer—that he himself, to judge from his inscriptions, most wished to be remembered.
<br>
<br>Such activities, however, did not prevent <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a> from following an active expansionist policy. Campaigns to the east confirmed gains probably made by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_I?lang=en'>Cyrus_I</a> the Great and added large sections of the northern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indian_subcontinent?lang=en'>Indian_subcontinent</a> to the list of Persian-controlled provinces. Expansion in the west began about <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/516_BC?lang=en'>516_BC</a> when <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a> moved against the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dardanelles?lang=en'>Dardanelles</a> as a first step toward an attack on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythians?lang=en'>Scythians</a> along the western and northern shores of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Black_Sea?lang=en'>Black_Sea</a>. The real strategic purpose behind this move probably was to disrupt and, if possible, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Interrupt?lang=en'>Interrupt</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> trade with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Black_Sea?lang=en'>Black_Sea</a> area, which supplied much grain to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>. Crossing into <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe?lang=en'>Europe</a> for the first time, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a> campaigned with comparatively little success to the north of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Danube?lang=en'>Danube</a>. He retreated in good order, however, with only limited losses, and a bridgehead across the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dardanelles?lang=en'>Dardanelles</a> was established.
<br>
<br>Perhaps partly in response to these developments or perhaps for more purely internal reasons, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> cities on the west coast of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a> revolted against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> rule in 500 BC. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Persians?lang=en'>The_Persians</a> were apparently taken by surprise, and at first the rebellion prospered. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionians?lang=en'>Ionians</a> received some limited assistance from the Athenians and in 498 felt strong enough to make another offensive. With one hand <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a> negotiated; with the other he assembled a counterattack. The first <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> military efforts proved only partially successful, however, and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionians?lang=en'>Ionians</a> enjoyed another respite in the years 496–495. A renewed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> offensive in 494 was successful. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> fleet was badly beaten off <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a>, and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> land army began a systematic reduction of the rebel cities. About 492 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mardonius?lang=en'>Mardonius</a>, a son-in-law of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a>, was made special commissioner to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a>. He suppressed local tyrants and returned democratic government to many cities. In time the wounds caused by the revolt and its suppression healed, and by 481 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a> was able to levy troops in this region with little trouble.
<br>
<br>By 492 BC <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mardonius?lang=en'>Mardonius</a> had also recovered <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrace?lang=en'>Thrace</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Republic_of_Macedonia?lang=en'>Republic_of_Macedonia</a>, first gained in the campaign against the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythians?lang=en'>Scythians</a> and lost during the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionian_Revolt?lang=en'>Ionian_Revolt</a>. There followed the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> invasion of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> that led to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a>’s defeat at the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Battle_of_Marathon</a> late in the summer of 490 BC. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Great_King?lang=en'>The_Great_King</a> was forced to retreat and to face the fact that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> problem, which had probably seemed to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> a minor issue on the western extremity of the empire, would require a more concerted and massive effort. Thus began preparations for an invasion of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> on a grand, coordinated scale. These plans were interrupted in 486 by two events: a serious revolt in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ptolemaic_Kingdom?lang=en'>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</a>, and the death of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a>.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a> (reigned 486–465 BC), <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a>’s eldest son by Queen <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Atossa?lang=en'>Atossa</a>, was born after his father had come to the throne; he had been designated official heir perhaps as early as 498, and while <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_prince?lang=en'>Crown_prince</a> he had ruled as the king’s governor in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon?lang=en'>Babylon</a>. The new king quickly suppressed the revolt in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ptolemaic_Kingdom?lang=en'>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</a> in a single campaign in 484. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a> then broke with the policy followed by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_I?lang=en'>Cyrus_I</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a> of ruling foreign lands with a fairly light hand, and, in a manner compatible with local traditions, he ruthlessly ignored <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a> forms of rule and imposed his will on the rebellious province in a thoroughly <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> style. Plans for the invasion of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> begun under <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a> were then still further delayed by a major revolt in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia?lang=en'>Babylonia</a> about 482 BC, which also was suppressed with a heavy hand.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a> then turned his attention westward to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>. He wintered in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sardis?lang=en'>Sardis</a> in 481–480 and thence led a combined land and sea invasion of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Northern_Greece?lang=en'>Northern_Greece</a> fell to the invaders in the summer of 480, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> stand at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Thermopylae?lang=en'>Battle_of_Thermopylae</a> in August of 480 came to naught, and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> land forces marched on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, taking and burning the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acropolis_of_Athens?lang=en'>Acropolis_of_Athens</a>. But the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> fleet lost the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Battle_of_Salamis</a>, and the impetus of the invasion was blunted. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a>, who had by then been away from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a> rather long for a king with such widespread responsibilities, returned home and left <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mardonius?lang=en'>Mardonius</a> in charge of further operations. The real end of the invasion came with the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Plataea?lang=en'>Battle_of_Plataea</a>, the fall of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia?lang=en'>Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia</a> (a stronghold of pro-Persian forces), and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> naval loss at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Mycale?lang=en'>Battle_of_Mycale</a> in 479. Of the three, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> loss at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Plataea?lang=en'>Battle_of_Plataea</a> was perhaps the most decisive. Up until <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mardonius?lang=en'>Mardonius</a> was killed, the issue of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a> was probably still in doubt, but, once leaderless, the less organized and less disciplined <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> forces collapsed. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Time?lang=en'>Time</a> and again in later years this was to be the pattern in such encounters, for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> never solved the military problem posed by the disciplined <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a>.
<br>
<br>The formation of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Delian_League</a>, the rise of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Imperialism?lang=en'>Imperialism</a>, troubles on the west coast of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a>, and the end of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> military ambitions in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegean_Sea?lang=en'>Aegean_Sea</a> followed rapidly in the decade after <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Plataea?lang=en'>Battle_of_Plataea</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a> probably lost interest in the proceedings and sank deeper and deeper into the comforts of life in his capital cities of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susa?lang=en'>Susa</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ecbatana?lang=en'>Ecbatana</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persepolis?lang=en'>Persepolis</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harem?lang=en'>Harem</a> intrigues, which were steadily to sap the strength and vitality of the Achaemenian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire?lang=en'>Empire</a>, led to the king’s assassination in 465 BC.
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia?lang=en'>Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia</a> to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_III?lang=en'>Darius_III</a>
<br>The death of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a> was a major turning point in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> history. Occasional flashes of vigour and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Intelligence?lang=en'>Intelligence</a> by some of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a>’ successors were too infrequent to prevent eventual collapse but did allow the empire to die gradually. It is a tribute to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_I?lang=en'>Cyrus_I</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_I?lang=en'>Cambyses_I</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_III?lang=en'>Darius_III</a> that the empire they constructed was as resilient as it proved to be after <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a>.
<br>
<br>The three kings that followed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a> on the throne—Artaxerxes I (reigned 465–425 BC), <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_II_of_Persia?lang=en'>Xerxes_II_of_Persia</a> (425–424), and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_II?lang=en'>Darius_II</a> (423–404)—were all comparatively weak as individuals and as kings, and such successes as the empire enjoyed during their reigns were mainly the result of the efforts of subordinates or of the troubles faced by their adversaries. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia?lang=en'>Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia</a> faced several rebellions, the most important of which was that of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>History_of_ancient_Egypt</a> in 459, not fully suppressed until 454. An <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Advantageous?lang=en'>Advantageous</a> peace (the Peace of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Callias_II?lang=en'>Callias_II</a>) with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> was signed in 448 BC, whereby the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> agreed to stay out of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegean_Sea?lang=en'>Aegean_Sea</a> and the Athenians agreed to leave <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a> to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> broke the peace in 439 in an attack on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samos?lang=en'>Samos</a>, and in its aftermath the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> made some military gains in the west. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_II_of_Persia?lang=en'>Xerxes_II_of_Persia</a> ruled only about <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/45_Days?lang=en'>45_Days</a> and was killed while in a drunken stupor by the son of one of his father’s concubines. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jody_Hamilton?lang=en'>Jody_Hamilton</a> was himself killed by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_II?lang=en'>Darius_II</a>, who rose to the throne through palace intrigue. Several revolts marred his reign, including one in Media, which was rather close to home.
<br>
<br>The major event of these three reigns was the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_War</a> between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, which was fought, with occasional pauses, over the latter decades of the 5th century BC. The situation was ripe for exploitation by the famous <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> archers, the gold coins of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> that depicted an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archery?lang=en'>Archery</a> on their <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Obverse_and_reverse?lang=en'>Obverse_and_reverse</a> and that were used with considerable skill by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> in bribing first one <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> state and then another. Initially the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> encouraged <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> and from this gained the Peace of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Callias_II?lang=en'>Callias_II</a>. Then, after the disastrous <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> campaign against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily?lang=en'>Sicily</a> in 413, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> intervened on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>’s side. By the treaty of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus?lang=en'>Miletus</a> in 412, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> recovered complete freedom in western <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a> in return for agreeing to pay for seamen to man the Peloponnesian fleet. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> gold and Spartan soldiers brought about the fall of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>History_of_Athens</a> in 404 BC. Despite the fact that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> played the two sides against each other to their own advantage, they should have done better. One observes a certain lack of control from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susa?lang=en'>Susa</a> by the king in these proceedings, and the two principal governors in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a> who were involved, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tissaphernes?lang=en'>Tissaphernes</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sardis?lang=en'>Sardis</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pharnabazus_II?lang=en'>Pharnabazus_II</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hellespontine_Phrygia?lang=en'>Hellespontine_Phrygia</a>, seemed to have permitted a personal power rivalry to stand in the way of a really coordinated <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> intervention in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> war. When <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ptolemaic_Kingdom?lang=en'>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</a> revolted in 405 BC, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> was unable to do much about it, and from that point forward <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ptolemaic_Kingdom?lang=en'>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</a> remained essentially an independent state.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia?lang=en'>Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia</a> came to the throne in 404 and reigned until 359 BC. The main events of his long rule were the war with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> that ended with a peace favourable to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>; the revolt and loss to the empire of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ptolemaic_Kingdom?lang=en'>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</a>; the rebellion of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_I?lang=en'>Cyrus_I</a> the Younger, brother of the king; and the uprising known as the revolt of the satraps.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>, triumphant over <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, built a small empire of its own and was soon involved in a war against the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>, the principal issue again being the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> cities of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a>. While <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> played one <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> governor in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a> against the other, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> spent gold in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> to raise rebellion on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>’s home ground. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Persians?lang=en'>The_Persians</a> rebuilt their fleet and placed a competent <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Admiral?lang=en'>Admiral</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conon?lang=en'>Conon</a>, in command. The contest continued from 400 to 387, with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> forced to act on an ever-shrinking front. A revitalized <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, supported by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>, created a balance of power in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>, and eventually <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia?lang=en'>Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia</a> was able to step in, at the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>’ request, and dictate the so-called King’s Peace of 387–386 BC. Once again the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> gave up any claim to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a> and further agreed to maintain the status <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quo_(Status_Quo_album)?lang=en'>Quo_(Status_Quo_album)</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> itself.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_I?lang=en'>Cyrus_I</a> the Younger, though caught in an assassination attempt at the time of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia?lang=en'>Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia</a>’ coronation, was nevertheless forgiven and was returned to the command of a province in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a>. But he revolted again in 401 BC and, supported by 10,000 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mercenary?lang=en'>Mercenary</a>, marched eastward to contest the throne. He was defeated and killed at the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Cunaxa?lang=en'>Battle_of_Cunaxa</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesopotamia?lang=en'>Mesopotamia</a> that summer. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mercenary?lang=en'>Mercenary</a>, however, were not broken and, though harried, left the field in good order and began their famous march, recorded in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Anabasis_of_Alexander?lang=en'>The_Anabasis_of_Alexander</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xenophon?lang=en'>Xenophon</a>, north to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Black_Sea?lang=en'>Black_Sea</a> and home. Probably no other event in late <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> history revealed more clearly to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> the essential internal weakness of the Achaemenian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire?lang=en'>Roman_Empire</a> than the escape of so large a body of men from the very heart of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> domain.
<br>
<br>Since 379 BC <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia?lang=en'>Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia</a> had been gathering <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mercenary?lang=en'>Mercenary</a> in order to mount a campaign against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>History_of_ancient_Egypt</a>. An attack in 373 failed against the native <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thirtieth_Dynasty_of_Egypt?lang=en'>Thirtieth_Dynasty_of_Egypt</a>. On the heels of this failure came the revolt of the satraps, or provincial governors. Several satraps rose against the central power, and one, Aroandas (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orontes_I?lang=en'>Orontes_I</a>), a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satrap?lang=en'>Satrap</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armenia?lang=en'>Armenia</a>, went so far as to stamp his own gold coinage as a direct challenge to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia?lang=en'>Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia</a>. The general plan of the rebels appears to have been for a combined attack. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Rebel_Media?lang=en'>The_Rebel_Media</a> satraps were to coordinate their march eastward through <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syria?lang=en'>Syria</a> with an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a> attack, under the king <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Teos_of_Egypt?lang=en'>Teos_of_Egypt</a>, and support by Greek <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mercenary?lang=en'>Mercenary</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a> attack was called off because of a revolt in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ptolemaic_Kingdom?lang=en'>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</a> by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Teos_of_Egypt?lang=en'>Teos_of_Egypt</a>’s brother, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia?lang=en'>Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia</a> managed to defeat the satraps who were left alone to face the king’s wrath. Several of the satraps, including Aroandas, were actually forgiven and returned to their governorships. In general the impression is that, in the end, rather than fight the central authority, the satraps were willing to return to their own provinces and plunder there in the name of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia?lang=en'>Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia</a>. Perhaps they saw that they actually had more authority and more control over real events in their own provincial territories than <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia?lang=en'>Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia</a> had in his empire.
<br>
<br>Plot and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Counterplot?lang=en'>Counterplot</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harem?lang=en'>Harem</a> intrigue, and murder brought <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaxerxes_III?lang=en'>Artaxerxes_III</a> to the throne in 359 BC. He promptly exterminated many of his relatives who might have challenged his rule—all to no <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Avail?lang=en'>Avail</a>, for revolts continued to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rock_music?lang=en'>Rock_music</a> the empire. A fresh attempt to win back <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>History_of_ancient_Egypt</a> was repulsed in 351. This setback encouraged revolt in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sidon?lang=en'>Sidon</a> and eventually in all of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/State_of_Palestine?lang=en'>State_of_Palestine</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phoenicia?lang=en'>Phoenicia</a>. Parts of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cilicia?lang=en'>Cilicia</a> joined the rebellion, but the revolt there was crushed in 345, the same year it had begun. Peace was achieved only temporarily; <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mercenary?lang=en'>Mercenary</a> from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia?lang=en'>Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Argos?lang=en'>Argos</a>, as well as from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> cities of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a>, gathered for a new attempt on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>History_of_ancient_Egypt</a>. Led by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaxerxes_III?lang=en'>Artaxerxes_III</a> himself, it succeeded in 343 BC. But the local <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a> dynasty fled south to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nubia?lang=en'>Nubia</a>, where it maintained an independent kingdom that kept alive the hopes of a dynastic revival. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> then misplayed its hand in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> by refusing aid to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> against the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rising_Power?lang=en'>Rising_Power</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_II_of_Macedon?lang=en'>Philip_II_of_Macedon</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Macedonia?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Macedonia</a>. In 339 BC <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> troops were fighting alone in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrace?lang=en'>Thrace</a> against the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Macedonians?lang=en'>Ancient_Macedonians</a>, and in the following year, at the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaeronea?lang=en'>Chaeronea</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_II_of_Macedon?lang=en'>Philip_II_of_Macedon</a> extended his <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theban_hegemony?lang=en'>Theban_hegemony</a> over all of Greece—a united <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> that was to prove impervious to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> gold.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaxerxes_III?lang=en'>Artaxerxes_III</a> was poisoned by his <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician?lang=en'>Physician</a> at the order of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eunuch?lang=en'>Eunuch</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bagoas?lang=en'>Bagoas</a>. The latter made <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaxerxes_III?lang=en'>Artaxerxes_III</a>’ youngest son, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arses_of_Persia?lang=en'>Arses_of_Persia</a>, king (338–336 BC) in hopes of being the power behind the throne, but <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arses_of_Persia?lang=en'>Arses_of_Persia</a> did not bend easily to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bagoas?lang=en'>Bagoas</a>’s will. He attempted to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poison?lang=en'>Poison</a> the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kingmaker?lang=en'>Kingmaker</a> but was himself killed in retaliation. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bagoas?lang=en'>Bagoas</a> then engineered the accession of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_III?lang=en'>Darius_III</a>, a 45-year-old former <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satrap?lang=en'>Satrap</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armenia?lang=en'>Armenia</a>. So many members of the royal house had been murdered in the court intrigue that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_III?lang=en'>Darius_III</a> probably held the closest <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blood?lang=en'>Blood</a> claim to the throne by virtue of being the grandnephew of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia?lang=en'>Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_III?lang=en'>Darius_III</a> was able to put down yet another rebellion in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ptolemaic_Kingdom?lang=en'>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</a> under Khababash in 337–336 BC, but the beginning of the end of the Achaemenian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire?lang=en'>Empire</a> came soon afterward, in May 334, when he lost the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_the_Granicus?lang=en'>Battle_of_the_Granicus</a> to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great?lang=en'>Alexander_the_Great</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persepolis?lang=en'>Persepolis</a> fell to the invader in April 330, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_III?lang=en'>Darius_III</a>, the last <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>, was murdered in the summer of the same year while fleeing the conqueror. His unfinished tomb at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persepolis?lang=en'>Persepolis</a> bears witness to his lack of preparation.

<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great?lang=en'>Alexander_the_Great</a> did not win his victories easily, however, and the catalog of troubles that marked the latter part of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> Empire—rebellions, murders, weak kings trapped in the harems, missed chances, and foolish policies—cannot be the whole story. The sources, mostly <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language?lang=en'>Greek_language</a>, are often prejudiced against the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> and tend to view events from but a single point of view. No government could have lasted so long, found its way somehow through so many difficulties, and in the end actually have fought so hard against the conqueror without having much virtue with which to balance its vices.
<br>
<br>The culture that developed under the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> was in reality the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Copyright_collective?lang=en'>Copyright_collective</a> and cultures of the many subject peoples of the empire. From this <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mosaic?lang=en'>Mosaic</a> it is sometimes difficult to sort out that which is distinctively <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> or distinctively a development of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> period and therefore perhaps an early Iranian contribution to general Middle Eastern society and culture.
<br>
<br>The languages of the empire were as varied as its peoples. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Persians?lang=en'>The_Persians</a>, at least originally, spoke <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Persian?lang=en'>Old_Persian</a>, a southwestern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dialect?lang=en'>Dialect</a> of Iranian (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> was a northwestern Iranian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dialect?lang=en'>Dialect</a>), and were a nonliterate society. Their language was first written when <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_III?lang=en'>Darius_III</a> commanded that a script suitable for this purpose be invented so that he might inscribe the record of his rise to power at Bīsotūn (the inscriptions in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Persian?lang=en'>Old_Persian</a> attributed to earlier kings were likely written during the reign of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_III?lang=en'>Darius_III</a> or are later historical forgeries). That few could read <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Persian?lang=en'>Old_Persian</a> might be the reason why <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_III?lang=en'>Darius_III</a> at Bīsotūn established the tradition that royal inscriptions should be trilingual in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Persian?lang=en'>Old_Persian</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Akkadian_language?lang=en'>Akkadian_language</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elamite_language?lang=en'>Elamite_language</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Persian?lang=en'>Old_Persian</a> was never a working written language of the empire. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elamite_language?lang=en'>Elamite_language</a>, written on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clay_tablet?lang=en'>Clay_tablet</a> tablets, appears to have been the language of many of the administrators in Persis and, it may be assumed, in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elam?lang=en'>Elam</a>. Archives of administrative documents in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elamite_language?lang=en'>Elamite_language</a> have been found at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persepolis?lang=en'>Persepolis</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Aramaic_language?lang=en'>Old_Aramaic_language</a>, however, was the language of much of the empire and was probably the language most used in the imperial bureaucracy. The beginnings of the strong influence of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Aramaic_language?lang=en'>Old_Aramaic_language</a> on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>, which is so evident in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Persian?lang=en'>Middle_Persian</a> of Sāsānian times, can already be seen in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Persian?lang=en'>Old_Persian</a> royal inscriptions of late <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> times. (See also <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iranian_languages?lang=en'>Iranian_languages</a>.)
<br>
<br>Little is known of Iranian social organization in the period. In general, it was based on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Feudalism?lang=en'>Feudalism</a> lines that were drawn in part by economic and social functions. Traditional <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indo-Iranians?lang=en'>Indo-Iranians</a> society consisted of three classes: the warriors or aristocracy, the priests, and the farmers or herdsmen. Crosscutting these divisions was a tribal structure based on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patrilineality?lang=en'>Patrilineality</a>. The title king of kings, used even in the 20th century by the shahs of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran?lang=en'>History_of_Iran</a>, implies that the central authority exercised power through a pyramidal structure that was controlled at levels below the supreme authority by individuals who were themselves, in a certain sense, kings. Traditionally, the king was elected from a particular family by the warrior class; he was sacred, and a certain royal charisma attached to his person.
<br>
<br>Such a method of organizing and controlling society undoubtedly changed under the influences and demands of imperial power and underwent much modification as Iranians increasingly borrowed social and political ideas from the peoples they ruled. Even in later times, nevertheless, there is evidence that the original Iranian concepts of kingship and social organization were still honoured and remained the ideals of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Culture_of_Iran?lang=en'>Culture_of_Iran</a>.
<br>
<br>Iranian religion in the pre-Achaemenian and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> periods is a subject on which there is little scholarly agreement. When the Iranians first entered the dim light of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Protohistory?lang=en'>Protohistory</a> period, they were certainly <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polytheism?lang=en'>Polytheism</a> whose religious beliefs and practices closely paralleled other <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indo-Iranians?lang=en'>Indo-Iranians</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Proto-Indo-European_religion?lang=en'>Proto-Indo-European_religion</a> groups at the same stage in history. Their gods were associated with natural phenomena, with social, military, and economic functions, and with abstract concepts such as justice and truth. Their religious practices included, among others, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Animal_sacrifice?lang=en'>Animal_sacrifice</a>, a reverence for fire, and the drinking of the juice of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Haoma?lang=en'>Haoma</a> plant, a natural intoxicant.
<br>
<br>Probably about 600 BC there arose in the northeast of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plateau?lang=en'>Plateau</a> the great Iranian religious <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prophet?lang=en'>Prophet</a> and teacher <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zoroaster?lang=en'>Zoroaster</a> (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zoroaster?lang=en'>Zoroaster</a>). The history of the religion that he founded is even more complicated and controversial than the history of pre-Zoroastrian Iranian religion. Yet certain features of his religious reform stand out. He was an ethical <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prophet?lang=en'>Prophet</a> of the highest rank, stressing constantly the need to act righteously and to speak the truth and abhor the lie. In his teaching, the lie was almost personified as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Druj?lang=en'>Druj</a>, chief in the kingdom of the demons, to which he relegated many of the earlier <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indo-Iranians?lang=en'>Indo-Iranians</a> deities. His god was <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ahura?lang=en'>Ahura</a> Mazdā, who, it seems likely, was a creation, in name and attributes, of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zoroaster?lang=en'>Zoroaster</a>. Though in a certain sense technically <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monotheism?lang=en'>Monotheism</a>, early <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zoroastrianism?lang=en'>Zoroastrianism</a> viewed the world in strongly <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dualism?lang=en'>Dualism</a> terms, for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ahura?lang=en'>Ahura</a> Mazdā and the Lie were deeply involved in a struggle for the human <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul?lang=en'>Soul</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zoroaster?lang=en'>Zoroaster</a>, as might be expected, attempted to reform earlier Iranian religious practices and beliefs. He first rejected and then perhaps allowed in a modified form the practice of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Haoma?lang=en'>Haoma</a> cult, clearly condemned the practice of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Animal_sacrifice?lang=en'>Animal_sacrifice</a>, and elevated to central importance in the ritual a reverence for fire. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fire_worship?lang=en'>Fire_worship</a>, however, is a misnomer, because the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zoroastrianism?lang=en'>Zoroastrianism</a> have never worshiped fire but rather have revered it as the symbol par excellence of truth.
<br>
<br>The crucial question is: Were the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zoroastrianism?lang=en'>Zoroastrianism</a> or at least followers of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prophet?lang=en'>Prophet</a> in the terms in which they understood his message? Possibly <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_I?lang=en'>Cyrus_I</a> the Great was, probably <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a> was, and almost certainly <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a> and his successors were. Such a simple answer to the question is possible, however, only if it is understood that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zoroastrianism?lang=en'>Zoroastrianism</a> as a religion had already undergone considerable development and modification since <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zoroaster?lang=en'>Zoroaster</a>’s lifetime, influenced by the beliefs and practices and by the religions of those people of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_East?lang=en'>Middle_East</a> with whom the expanding Iranians had <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Intimate_Contact?lang=en'>Intimate_Contact</a>.
<br>
<br>The god of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> kings was the great <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ahura?lang=en'>Ahura</a> Mazdā, from whom they understood they had received their empire and with whose aid they accomplished all deeds. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a> and his successors mention other deities by name, but <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ahura?lang=en'>Ahura</a> Mazdā remains supreme. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a> names only <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ahura?lang=en'>Ahura</a> Mazdā in his inscriptions. More significant, however, is <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a>’s tone, which is entirely compatible with the moral tone of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zoroaster?lang=en'>Zoroaster</a> and, in some instances, even compatible with details of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zoroaster?lang=en'>Zoroaster</a>’s <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_theology?lang=en'>Christian_theology</a>. During the reigns of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a>, the archaeological record reveals that religious rituals were in force that were also compatible with an evolved and evolving <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zoroastrianism?lang=en'>Zoroastrianism</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Haoma?lang=en'>Haoma</a> cult was practiced at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persepolis?lang=en'>Persepolis</a>, but <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Animal_sacrifice?lang=en'>Animal_sacrifice</a> is not attested. More important, fire clearly played a central role in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> religion.
<br>
<br>There may have been religious overtones in the quarrel between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_I?lang=en'>Cambyses_I</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a> on the one hand and the false Bardiya—a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magi?lang=en'>Magi</a>, or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> priest—on the other. Certainly there were religious as well as political motivations behind <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a>’ suppression of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daeva?lang=en'>Daeva</a> (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deva_(Hinduism)?lang=en'>Deva_(Hinduism)</a>) worshipers and the destruction of their <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egyptian_temple?lang=en'>Egyptian_temple</a>. It is possible that there was some conflict among the royal <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>, who were followers of one form of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zoroastrianism?lang=en'>Zoroastrianism</a>, the supporters of a different version of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zoroastrianism?lang=en'>Zoroastrianism</a> as practiced by other Iranians, believers in older forms of Iranian religion, and believers in foreign religions, which in the light of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zoroaster?lang=en'>Zoroaster</a>’s teachings were reprehensible. Compromises and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syncretism?lang=en'>Syncretism</a>, however, probably could not be prevented. Though the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zoroastrian_calendar?lang=en'>Zoroastrian_calendar</a> was adopted as the official calendar of the empire in the reign of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia?lang=en'>Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia</a>, by the time of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia?lang=en'>Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia</a> the ancient Iranian god <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mithra?lang=en'>Mithra</a> and the goddess <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anahita?lang=en'>Anahita</a> (Anahīti) had been accepted in the royal religion alongside <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ahura?lang=en'>Ahura</a> Mazdā.
<br>
<br>Thus, in a sense, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> kings were <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zoroastrianism?lang=en'>Zoroastrianism</a>, but <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zoroastrianism?lang=en'>Zoroastrianism</a> itself was probably no longer exactly the religion <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zoroaster?lang=en'>Zoroaster</a> had attempted to establish. What the religion of the people beyond court circles may have been is almost impossible to say. One suspects that a variety of ancient Iranian cults and beliefs were prevalent. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magi?lang=en'>Magi</a>, the traditional priests of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a>, may have wielded more influence in the countryside than they did at court, and popular beliefs and practices may have been more deeply influenced by contact with other peoples and other religions. Later <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_antiquity?lang=en'>Classical_antiquity</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zoroastrianism?lang=en'>Zoroastrianism</a>, as known in the Sāsānian period, was an amalgam of such popular cults, of the religion of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> court, and of the teachings of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prophet?lang=en'>Prophet</a> in their purer form. (See also <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zoroastrianism?lang=en'>Zoroastrianism</a>.)
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> art, like <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> religion, was a blend of many elements. In describing, with justifiable pride, the construction of his palace at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susa?lang=en'>Susa</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a> says,

<br>
<br>This was an imperial art on a scale the world had not seen before. Materials and artists were drawn from all the lands ruled by the great king, and thus tastes, styles, and motifs became mixed together in an eclectic art and architecture that in itself mirrored the empire and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>’ understanding of how that empire ought to function. Yet the whole was entirely <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>. Just as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> were tolerant in matters of local government and custom as long as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> controlled the general policy and administration of the empire, so also were they tolerant in art so long as the finished and total effect was <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>. At <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pasargadae?lang=en'>Pasargadae</a>, the capital of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_I?lang=en'>Cyrus_I</a> the Great and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_I?lang=en'>Cambyses_I</a> in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> homeland (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fars_Province?lang=en'>Fars_Province</a>), and at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persepolis?lang=en'>Persepolis</a>, the neighbouring <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> founded by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a> the Great and used by all his successors, one can trace to a foreign origin almost all the details in the construction and embellishment of the architecture and the sculptured reliefs, but the conception, planning, and overall finished product are distinctly <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> and could not have been created by any of the foreign groups who supplied the king of kings with artistic talent. This was true also of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decorative_arts?lang=en'>Decorative_arts</a>, at which the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> excelled: fine <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metalworking?lang=en'>Metalworking</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tableware?lang=en'>Tableware</a>, jewelry, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seal_carving?lang=en'>Seal_carving</a>, weaponry and its decoration, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pottery?lang=en'>Pottery</a>.
<br>
<br>It has been suggested that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> called on the subject peoples for artists because they were themselves crude barbarians with little taste and needed quickly to create an imperial art to match their sudden rise to political power. Yet excavations at sites from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Protohistory?lang=en'>Protohistory</a> period show this not to have been the case. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_I?lang=en'>Cyrus_I</a> may have been the leader of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> tribes not yet as sophisticated nor as civilized as the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia?lang=en'>Babylonia</a> or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a>, but, when he chose to build <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pasargadae?lang=en'>Pasargadae</a>, he had a long artistic tradition behind him that was probably already distinctly Iranian and that was in many ways the equal of any. To show this, two examples suffice: the tradition of the columned hall in architecture and fine gold work. The former can now be seen as belonging to an architectural tradition on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iranian_Plateau?lang=en'>Iranian_Plateau</a> that extended back through the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> period to at least the beginning of the 1st millennium BC. The rich <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> gold work, which inscriptions suggest may have been a specialty of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a>, was in the tradition of the delicate metalwork found in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron_Age?lang=en'>Iron_Age</a> II times at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Teppe_Hasanlu?lang=en'>Teppe_Hasanlu</a> VI and still earlier at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marlik?lang=en'>Marlik</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persepolis?lang=en'>Persepolis</a>, primarily the creation of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a>, is one of the great artistic legacies of the ancient world, with its carefully proportioned and well-organized ground plan, rich architectural ornament, and magnificent decorative reliefs.
<br>The organization and achievement of the Achaemenian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire?lang=en'>Empire</a>
<br>At the centre of the empire sat the king of kings. Around him was gathered a court composed of powerful hereditary landholders, the upper echelons of the army, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harem?lang=en'>Harem</a>, religious functionaries, and the bureaucracy that administered the whole. This court lived mainly in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susa?lang=en'>Susa</a> but went in the hot summer months to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ecbatana?lang=en'>Ecbatana</a> (modern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hamadan?lang=en'>Hamadan</a>), probably in the spring to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persepolis?lang=en'>Persepolis</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fars_Province?lang=en'>Fars_Province</a>, and perhaps sometimes to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon?lang=en'>Babylon</a>. In a smaller version it traveled with the king when he was away in the provinces.
<br>
<br>The provinces, or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satrap?lang=en'>Satrap</a>, were ruled by satraps (governors), technically appointed by the central authority but who often became hereditary subkings, particularly in the later years of the empire. They were surrounded and assisted in their functions by a court modeled on that of the central government and were powerful officials. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Great_King?lang=en'>The_Great_King</a> was nevertheless theoretically able to maintain considerable control in local affairs. He was the last court of appeal in judicial matters. He directly controlled the standing military forces stationed in the provinces, though as time went on the military and civil authority in the provinces tended to become combined under the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satrap?lang=en'>Satrap</a>. The king was also aided in keeping control in the provinces by the so-called king’s eyes or, better, the king’s ears—officials from the central government who traveled throughout the empire and who reported directly back to the king on what they learned. The number of provinces and their boundaries varied greatly from time to time; at the beginning of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a>’s reign there were 20 provinces. In general, as time went on, the number increased, partly because of the need to reassert control over the satraps by decreasing their power base, partly because the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Feudalism?lang=en'>Feudalism</a> structure that underlay <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> society required rewarding more and more people with a role in government, and partly because the original 20 provinces were undoubtedly simply too large to permit efficient administration.
<br>
<br>The army was a particularly important element within the empire. It, too, developed and changed with time. After <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_I?lang=en'>Cyrus_I</a> the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conscription?lang=en'>Conscription</a>, based on the responsibility of all male <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> to fight for the king, was replaced by a professional <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Standing_army?lang=en'>Standing_army</a> supplemented by a troop levy from the subject peoples in times of intensive military activity. The elite of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Standing_army?lang=en'>Standing_army</a> were the 10,000 immortals, composed of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes?lang=en'>Medes</a>, 1,000 of whom were the personal guard of the king. The person who controlled this elite guard, as did <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a> on the death of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_I?lang=en'>Cambyses_I</a>, usually controlled all. The troops of the imperial levy fought alongside the regular army in national units, were armed according to their individual customs, but were usually officered by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>. Permanent bodies of troops were stationed at strategic points throughout the empire, and, to judge from the garrison at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elephantine?lang=en'>Elephantine</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ptolemaic_Kingdom?lang=en'>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</a>, these were actually military colonies, firmly settled into the local countryside. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mercenary?lang=en'>Mercenary</a> were used with increasing frequency in later years, and many <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> fought <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flat_module?lang=en'>Flat_module</a> for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> silver.
<br>
<br>Both the civil and the military administration, as well as public and private trade, were greatly facilitated by the famous royal <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> road system. Communications throughout the empire were better than any previous Middle Eastern power had maintained. The famous road from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susa?lang=en'>Susa</a> to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sardis?lang=en'>Sardis</a> in western <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a> is the best known of these imperial highways. It was an all-weather road maintained by the state. Over it ran a governmental <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chapar_Khaneh?lang=en'>Chapar_Khaneh</a> based on relay stations with remounts and fresh riders located a day’s ride apart. The speed with which a message could travel from the provinces to the king at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susa?lang=en'>Susa</a> was remarkable.
<br>
<br>On the whole, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> rule sat lightly on the subject peoples, at least under the early <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>. It was a conscious policy of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_I?lang=en'>Cyrus_I</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a> to permit conquered nations to retain their own religions, customs, methods of doing business, and even to some extent forms of government. This policy was exemplified by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_I?lang=en'>Cyrus_I</a>’s attitude toward the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia?lang=en'>Babylonia</a>, which led to his being accepted as the rightful successor of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nabonidus?lang=en'>Nabonidus</a>, his willingness to permit the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jews?lang=en'>Jews</a> to return to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/State_of_Palestine?lang=en'>State_of_Palestine</a> and to their own way of life, and his successors’ concern that this promise be honoured; <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambyses_I?lang=en'>Cambyses_I</a>’ behaviour in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a> and his acceptance by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a> as founder of a legitimate new <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a> dynasty; and the policy adopted under <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mardonius?lang=en'>Mardonius</a> toward the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a> cities following their rebellion. Perhaps even in the later empire, rebellious peoples, governments, and leaders were too often forgiven and not suppressed with the thoroughness sometimes characteristic of other regimes. Lapses in this policy, such as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a>’ violent reaction to rebellion in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon?lang=en'>Babylon</a>, stand out in the record.
<br>
<br>Law played an important role in the administration of the empire, and stories of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> justice abound in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> sources. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a> particularly wished to be remembered as the great lawgiver, and law reform was one of the cornerstones in his program for reorganizing the empire. To judge from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon?lang=en'>Babylon</a> evidence, two sets of law, possibly administered by two sets of courts, were in force in the provinces. One was the local law, undoubtedly based on custom and previous local codifications; the other was the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>, or imperial, law, based ultimately on the authority of the great king. A new word for law appeared in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_East?lang=en'>Middle_East</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> times, the Iranian dāta, and was borrowed by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Semitic_languages?lang=en'>Semitic_languages</a> used in the empire. In <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia?lang=en'>Babylonia</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aramaic_language?lang=en'>Aramaic_language</a>, sources give evidence for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> judges called by the Iranian word dāta-bar. These were probably the judges of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Imperial_Courts?lang=en'>Imperial_Courts</a>.
<br>
<br>With legal reform came reform and unification of tax structures. The tax structure of the empire was apparently based on the principle that all of the conquered lands were the actual property of the king. Thus taxes were rather rents, and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> and their land, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fars_Province?lang=en'>Fars_Province</a>, by virtue of not being a conquered people or land, were always tax-free. Each province was required to pay yearly a fixed amount in gold or silver, and each <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vassal?lang=en'>Vassal</a> state paid a fixed tribute in kind. Again going on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia?lang=en'>Babylonia</a> evidence, in previous times agricultural taxes had been levied in fixed amounts regardless of the fluctuating quality of the harvest, but under <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a> all land was surveyed, an estimate of its yield (based on an average of the harvests over several years) was from time to time established, and taxes were levied in fixed amounts based on a percentage of that average yield. This was not quite an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Income_tax?lang=en'>Income_tax</a>, since it was not based on a percentage of each year’s production, but it was at least a reasonable figure based on a reasonable production average.
<br>
<br>Breakdowns often occurred in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>’ effort to maintain a productive balance between local social structures, customs, laws, and government and the demands of the empire. The failure of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> to find such a balance when dealing with what was for them an extremely strange system of social and political organization—the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> polis, or city-state—probably lay at the heart of their never-ending troubles in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a> as much as did the power and ambitions of mainland <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>. Yet even the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionians?lang=en'>Ionians</a>, at the best of times, often realized the mutual advantages and benefits of the king’s peace and a unified western <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a> under a tolerant central administration.
<br>
<br>The economy of the empire was very much founded on that king’s peace; it was when the peace broke down with ever-increasing frequency during the last century of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> rule that the economy of the empire went into a decline that undoubtedly contributed significantly to the eventual political and military collapse. Wealth in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> world was very much founded on land and on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Agriculture?lang=en'>Agriculture</a>. Land was the principal reward that the king had available for those who gave service or who were in positions of great political or military power in the empire. Under <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a> there was a measure of land called a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bow_and_arrow?lang=en'>Bow_and_arrow</a> that was originally a unit considered sufficient to support one bowman, who then paid his duty for the land in military service. At the other end of the scale were enormous family estates, which often increased in size over the years and which were or became hereditary holdings. They were often administered by absentee landlords. Such major landholdings were, as one would expect, usually in the hands of Iranians, but <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aniran?lang=en'>Aniran</a> were also able to amass similar wealth and power, thereby testifying once again to the inherent tolerance with which the empire was administered. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> themselves took a positive role in encouraging <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Agriculture?lang=en'>Agriculture</a> by investing state funds and effort in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Irrigation?lang=en'>Irrigation</a> and the improvement of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horticulture?lang=en'>Horticulture</a>.
<br>
<br>They also invested in and endeavoured to promote trade, a major source of imperial wealth. The effect of the state-maintained road system on the encouragement of trade has already been mentioned. Equal attention was paid to developing seaborne trade. State-sponsored voyages of exploration were undertaken in order to search for new markets and new resources. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a> completed a project, begun by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt?lang=en'>Ancient_Egypt</a>, that connected the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nile?lang=en'>Nile</a> to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red_Sea?lang=en'>Red_Sea</a> by a canal, so that routes across the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arabian_Sea?lang=en'>Arabian_Sea</a> and into the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persian_Gulf?lang=en'>Persian_Gulf</a> could be used to link the eastern and western ends of his empire. As part of the same program, port development on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persian_Gulf?lang=en'>Persian_Gulf</a> coast was encouraged. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire?lang=en'>Roman_Empire</a> standardized weights and measures, efforts to develop and use coinage, and standardizing that coinage in the king’s name were all policies intended to encourage commerce and economic activity within the realm.
<br>
<br>Banking also played a role in the economy. Documents have survived from a family banking business in Babylonia—the house of Murashu and sons of Nippur—covering the years c. 455–403 BC; the firm evidently prospered greatly by lending money and by acting as a middleman in the system of tax collection. Interest rates were high, but borrowers were numerous.
<br>
<br>As time went on, there were clearly more and more such borrowers, for the later empire is marked by a general economic decline. The principal cause of this decline was the unsettled political conditions, but other, more indirect causes were unwise government interference in the economy, overtaxation, and the removal of too much <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hard_currency?lang=en'>Hard_currency</a> from the economy. Gold and silver tended to drain into the treasury of the central government from the provinces, and too little found its way back into general circulation. Disastrous <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Inflation?lang=en'>Inflation</a> was the result. The large sums of money paid to foreign <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mercenary?lang=en'>Mercenary</a> and as bribes to foreign governments must also have contributed to an unfavourable balance of payments that in turn stimulated <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Inflation?lang=en'>Inflation</a>. Such conditions hardly strengthened the empire and must have contributed, in ways that cannot be documented with certainty, to the political unrest that was their own main cause.
<br>
<br>Ultimately, the achievement of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> Persians was that they ruled with such creative tolerance over an area and a time that, for both the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_East?lang=en'>Middle_East</a> and for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe?lang=en'>Europe</a>, included the end of the ancient and the beginning of the modern world. In one sense, the ancient <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_East?lang=en'>Middle_East</a> died when <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_I?lang=en'>Cyrus_I</a> marched into <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon?lang=en'>Babylon</a>. Others would argue that its death came when <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great?lang=en'>Alexander_the_Great</a> burned <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persepolis?lang=en'>Persepolis</a>. The question remains open. What is clear is that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> Empire—the largest anyone had ever yet tried to hold together and one that was not surpassed until Rome reached its height—was a profound force in western <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a> and in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Europe?lang=en'>History_of_Europe</a> during an important period of ferment and transition in human history. That era was one of major developments in art, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greek_philosophy?lang=en'>Ancient_Greek_philosophy</a>, literature, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Historiography?lang=en'>Historiography</a>, religion, exploration, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Economics?lang=en'>Economics</a>, and science, and those developments provided the direct background for the further changes, along similar lines, that made the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hellenistic_period?lang=en'>Hellenistic_period</a> so important in history. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hellenistic_period?lang=en'>Hellenistic_period</a> probably would not have been possible, at least not in the form we know it, if it had had to build directly on the rather more narrow and less ambitious bases of the individual civilizations of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon?lang=en'>Babylon</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ptolemaic_Kingdom?lang=en'>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</a>, or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>. In a sense, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> passed on a concept of empire that, much modified by others, has remained something of a model of how it is possible for diverse peoples with variant customs, languages, religions, laws, and economic systems to flourish with mutual profit under a central government. In narrower terms, but for the Iranians themselves no less important, the Achaemenian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire?lang=en'>Roman_Empire</a> is seen as the beginning of the Iranian nation, one of the pivotal peoples in the modern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_East?lang=en'>Middle_East</a>
