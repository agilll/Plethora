<span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> (c. 524 - c. 460 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>) was an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>statesman</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Winston_Churchill</b></span> and general (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>strategos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Strategos</b></span>) whose emphasis on naval power and military skills were instrumental during the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> wars, victory in which ensured that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> survived its greatest ever threat. As the historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> stated in his History of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span>, ‘<span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> was a man who exhibited the most indubitable signs of genius; indeed, in this particular he has a claim on our admiration quite extraordinary and unparalleled.’ (1.138.3). A brilliant strategist and canny politician he was perhaps a little too thirsty for glory and power for his own good but <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> was, without doubt, one of the most important and colourful figures of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Classical Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> life is described by three notable ancient sources: <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> (c. 484 - c. 425 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>), <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> (c. 460 - c. 399 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>), and <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>  (c. 45 CE -  c. 120 CE). The first two are positive and praise the general’s <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>intelligence</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Espionage</b></span> and quick wits while <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> presents a talented leader thirsty for power at any cost. Of his early life we know little except that, unusually for those who rose to the top echelons of power in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> at the time, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> did not come from an aristocratic family but a more humble middle-class one. In addition, we know that his mother was not an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and his father was Neokles of the Lycomid family. According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> he was not a particularly <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>gifted</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Child_prodigy</b></span> student and spent his free-time as a youth writing and performing speeches. His lack of qualifications is famously referenced in the following quote from the same writer,
<br>
<br>Whenever in later life he found himself at any cultivated or elegant social gathering and was sneered at by men who regarded themselves as better educated, he could only defend himself rather arrogantly by saying that he had never learned how to tune a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>lyre</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lyre</b></span> or play a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>harp</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Harp</b></span>, but that he knew how to take a small or insignificant <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> in hand and raise it to glory and greatness. (<span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, 78)
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> also tells us he had two daughters called <span style='color: blue'><b>Sybaris</b></span> and Italia and one son, whom <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> once described as the most powerful man in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>:
<br>
<br>He once said jokingly that his son, who was spoiled by his mother and through her by himself, was more powerful than any man in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, ‘for the Athenians command the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, I command the Athenians, his mother commands me, and he commands her.' (<span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, 95)
<br>
<br>Made <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>archon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Archon</b></span> in 493 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> (although the significance of the title in this case is disputed by historians and may not refer to the typically understood highest administrative position) he is credited with developing <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>’ port – the <span style='color: blue'><b>Piraeus</b></span> – and building its fortifications and making it the largest <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>naval base</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naval_base</b></span> in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> world. As <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> puts it ‘he [<span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>] was always advising the Athenians, if a day should come when they were hard pressed by land, to go down into the <span style='color: blue'><b>Piraeus</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>defy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Motorola_Defy</b></span> the world with their fleet’ (The History of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span>, 1.93.3).
<br>
<br>This was, then, the beginning of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> becoming a significant and enduring naval power in the ancient <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mediterranean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mediterranean_Sea</b></span>. Still convinced that this was the way forward for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, a decade later in 483 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, would use the excuse of an on-going conflict with <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span> to push for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>surplus revenue</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Australian_referendum,_1910_(Surplus_Revenue)</b></span> from the silver mines of Laureion (discovered c. 503 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>) to be used to build war ships expanding the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> fleet from 70 to 200 ships and so be ready too for a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion. In his focus on naval power <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> also claimed divine backing from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oracle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delphi</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Apollo</b></span> at sacred <span style='color: blue'><b>Delphi</b></span>. He interpreted the typically obscure proclamation by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oracle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delphi</b></span> that ‘only a wooden wall will keep you safe’ as meaning not fortification walls but wooden ships were <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>’ best defence against invasion.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invaded <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> in 490 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> but the army of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> was famously defeated at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> – a land <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> of sword-wielding <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> and archers. The beating of mighty <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> gave the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> magnificent confidence and the victory was celebrated as no other but, in the event, it was only a minor set-back to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>’s plans for invasion. For <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>’ successor <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> would lead an even bigger army back on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> soil in 480 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>.
<br>
<br>In the period between these two attacks <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> secured political control of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, even managing to exile his great rivals <span style='color: blue'><b>Xanthippus</b></span> in 484 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> and Aristides in 482 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. With <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> at the top of the political tree <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> sought to strengthen her navy and practically abandon the traditional <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> soldier of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> warfare. Heavily armoured and carrying <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sword</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sword</b></span> and huge shield, the slow <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> was relocated to fast-moving warships – the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>trireme</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Trireme</b></span> with its triple bank of oars. Meeting an enemy at sea, ramming the opposition and finishing the job with a small team of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> would be <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>' strategy to see off <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>’s greatest ever threat. 
<br>
<br>In August 480 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army was met at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mountain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mountain_warfare</b></span> pass of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span> by a small band of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> led by Spartan King <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>. They held the pass for three days, and at the same time the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> contingent led by <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, managed to hold off the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> at the indecisive <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>naval battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naval_warfare</b></span> at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemision</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artemisium</b></span>. Such was <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>’ faith in his naval supremacy he ordered the abandonment of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> (if a 3rd century <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> inscription known as the ‘<span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> Decree’ from <span style='color: blue'><b>Troezen</b></span> is to be believed). The combined <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet, meanwhile, re-grouped in September at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Saronic Gulf</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Saronic_Gulf</b></span>, west of <span style='color: blue'><b>Piraeus</b></span>. The fleet included ships from some 30 city-states, notably from <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span>, and made up a total of some 300 ships. <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> commanded the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> contingent, by far the largest in the fleet with perhaps 200 ships. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet, although greatly exaggerated by ancient writers, was probably larger with around 500 ships.
<br>
<br>At this point some of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> states were in favour of abandoning <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and a naval conflict; instead their proposal was to fortify the Isthmus of <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> then may have sent word to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> of this possibility. He also had the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Carians</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>’ army spread messages to the effect that their loyalty was not to be trusted in the event of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>. These mixed messages and possible indicators of fractions in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> coalition <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>galvanized</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Galvanization</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> into action so that they moved at night and blocked the straits, preventing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet from abandoning their position. The wily <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> urged the wavering <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> to action, retorting to one commander: ‘those left behind at the starting line are never crowned with the victor’s wreath’ (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, 8.59). He would have his naval engagement and have it exactly where he wanted - <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>.
<br>
<br>When daylight came the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> commenced. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> held back and drew the bigger <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet into the narrow straits. In addition, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> knew that at a certain time of day a breeze and heavy swell would come and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> would be unprepared for this. In the confusion, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> had no maneuverability, their space was further limited by more of their ships coming in from their rear, and their sailors had no shore to retreat to after their vessel was sunk, unlike the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. Picking off the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> ships one at a time and spurred on by the knowledge they were fighting for their lives and their way-of-life, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> were victorious. <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> was treated as a hero and even given honours by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>’ great rival <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> went back home to <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span> but the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> land army, now commanded by <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>, was still a significant threat and so the two sides clashed again, this time on land at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Plataea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Plataea</b></span> in August 479 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. These forces were commanded by <span style='color: blue'><b>Xanthippus</b></span> and Aristides, back from exile, and there is no mention of <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>. Once again though, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, fielding the largest <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> army ever seen, won the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> which finally ended <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>’s ambitions in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> wars won a freedom which would allow <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> a never-before-seen period of artistic and cultural <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>endeavour</span> <span style='color: green'><b>HMS_Endeavour</b></span> which would form the foundations of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Western culture</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Western_culture</b></span> for millennia. More immediately, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> re-fortified <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue'><b>Piraeus</b></span>, and he also established the <span style='color: blue'><b>Kerameikos</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cemetery</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cemetery</b></span>. To ensure <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> could resist any future attacks the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> was formed in 477 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. This was a federation of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states led by, and later to be entirely dominated by, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> with each member contributing ships and money. 
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> was never in such a strong position but the career of <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> was, unfortunately, heading for a nose-dive. He was, following accusations of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>bribery</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bribery</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sacrilege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sacrilege</b></span>, and a suspicious association with Spartan traitor <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span> exiled from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> from 476 to 471 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>’ shadow remained, at least in the arts, as it was in 472 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> that the great <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>playwright</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Theatre</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeschylus</b></span> produced his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> which described the aftermath of <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>’ and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>’ great victory at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>. 
<br>
<br>Rather ironically, and after a brief stay in <span style='color: blue'><b>Argos</b></span> and then <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corcyra</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corfu</b></span> (<span style='color: blue'><b>Corfu</b></span>), <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> fled from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> by merchant vessel and was welcomed in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia</b></span>.
