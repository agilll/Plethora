The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>, and associated revolts in <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeolis</b></span>, Doris, <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyprus</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Caria</b></span>, were military rebellions by several <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> regions of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule, lasting from 499 BC to 493 BC. At the heart of the rebellion was the dissatisfaction of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> with the tyrants appointed by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> to rule them, along with the individual actions of two <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> tyrants, <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>. The cities of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> had been conquered by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> around 540 BC, and thereafter were ruled by native tyrants, nominated by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>. In 499 BC, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>, launched a joint expedition with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> to conquer <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>, in an attempt to bolster his position. The mission was a debacle, and sensing his imminent removal as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> chose to incite the whole of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> into rebellion against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> king <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> the Great.
<br>
<br>In 498 BC, supported by troops from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> marched on, captured, and burnt <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>. However, on their return journey to <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>, they were followed by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> troops, and decisively beaten at the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephesus</b></span>. This campaign was the only offensive action by the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span>, who subsequently went on the defensive. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> responded in 497 BC with a three pronged attack aimed at recapturing the outlying areas of the rebellion, but the spread of the revolt to <span style='color: blue'><b>Caria</b></span> meant that the largest army, under Daurises, relocated there. While initially campaigning successfully in <span style='color: blue'><b>Caria</b></span>, this army was annihilated in an ambush at the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Pedasus</b></span>. This resulted in a stalemate for the rest of 496 BC and 495 BC.
<br>
<br>By 494 BC the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army and navy had regrouped, and they made straight for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>epicentre</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Epicenter</b></span> of the rebellion at <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> fleet sought to defend <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> by sea, but was decisively beaten at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span>, after the defection of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Samians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Samos</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> was then besieged, captured, and its population was brought under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule. This double defeat effectively ended the revolt, and the <span style='color: blue'><b>Carians</b></span> surrendered to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> as a result. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> spent 493 BC reducing the cities along the west coast that still held out against them, before finally imposing a peace settlement on <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> which was generally considered to be both just and fair.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> constituted the first major conflict between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and the Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span>, and as such represents the first phase of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>. Although <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> had been brought back into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fold, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> vowed to punish <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> for their support of the revolt. Moreover, seeing that the myriad <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> states of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> posed a continued threat to the stability of his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span>, according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> decided to conquer the whole of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. In 492 BC, the first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, the next phase of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, began as a direct consequence of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Practically the only primary source for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> is the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>.[1] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, who has been called the 'Father of History',[2] was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> (then under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> overlordship). He wrote his 'Enquiries' (Greek—Historia; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>English</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kingdom_of_England</b></span>—(The) <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span>) around 440–430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ending in 450 BC).[3] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s approach was entirely novel, and at least from the point of view of Western society, he does seem to have invented 'history' as we know it.[3] As <span style='color: blue'><b>Holland</b></span> has it: "For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>manifest destiny</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Manifest_destiny</b></span>, but rather explanations he could verify personally."[3]
<br>
<br>Some subsequent ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, starting with <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>.[4][5] Nevertheless, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> chose to begin his history where <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> left off (at the Siege of Sestos), and therefore presumably felt that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting.[5] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> criticised <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> in his essay "On The Malignity of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>", describing <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> as philobarbaros (φιλοβάρβαρος, "barbarian-lover") and for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed.[6] A negative view of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> was passed on to <span style='color: blue'><b>Renaissance</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>, though he remained widely read.[7] However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by the age of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span> and some archaeological finds which have repeatedly confirmed his version of events.[8] The prevailing modern view is that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> generally did a remarkable job in his Historia, but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>skepticism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Skepticism</b></span>.[8] Nevertheless, there are still many historians who believe <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' account has an anti-Persian bias and that much of his story was embellished for dramatic effect.[9]
<br>
<br>In the dark age that followed the collapse of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycenaean civilization</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mycenaean_Greece</b></span>, significant numbers of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> emigrated to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> and settled there. These settlers were from three tribal groups: the <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeolians</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Dorians</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span>.[10] The <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> had settled along the coasts of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Caria</b></span>, founding the twelve cities which made up <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>.[10] These cities were <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Myus</b></span> and Priene in <span style='color: blue'><b>Caria</b></span>; <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephesus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Colophon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Colophon_(city)</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lebedos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lebedus</b></span>, Teos, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Clazomenae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Klazomenai</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Phocaea</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Erythrae</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span>; and the islands of <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Chios</b></span>.[11] Although the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> cities were independent from each other, they acknowledged their shared <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>heritage</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tradition</b></span>, and had a common <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_temple</b></span> and meeting place, the Panionion. They thus formed a 'cultural league', to which they would admit no other cities, or even other tribal <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span>.[12][13] The cities of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> had remained independent until they were conquered by the famous <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> king <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span>, in around 560 BC.[14] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> cities then remained under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> rule until <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span> was in turn conquered by the nascent Achaemenid <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>.[15]
<br>
<br>While fighting the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> had sent messages to the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> asking them to revolt against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> rule, which the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> had refused to do.[15] After <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> completed the conquest of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> cities now offered to be his subjects under the same terms as they had been subjects of <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span>.[15] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> refused, citing the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span>' unwillingness to help him previously. The <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> thus prepared to defend themselves, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> sent the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> general <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> to conquer <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>.[16] He first attacked <span style='color: blue'><b>Phocaea</b></span>; the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phocaeans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocaea</b></span> decided to entirely abandon their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> and sail into exile in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicily</b></span>, rather than become <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> subjects (although many subsequently returned).[17] Some Teians also chose to emigrate when <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> attacked Teos, but the rest of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> remained, and were in turn conquered.[18]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> found the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> difficult to rule. Elsewhere in the empire, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> was able to identify elite native groups to help him rule his new subjects – such as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>priesthood</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Clergy</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Judea</b></span>.[19] No such group existed in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities at this time; while there was usually an aristocracy, this was inevitably divided into feuding factions.[19] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> thus settled for sponsoring a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> in each <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>, even though this drew them into the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span>' internal conflicts. Furthermore, a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> might develop an independent streak, and have to be replaced.[19] The tyrants themselves faced a difficult task; they had to deflect the worst of their fellow citizens' hatred, while staying in the favour of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[19]
<br>
<br>About 40 years after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> conquest of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>, and in the reign of the fourth <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> king, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> the Great, the stand-in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> found himself in this familiar <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>predicament</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Predicament</b></span>.[20] <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>'s uncle <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> had accompanied <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> on campaign in 513 BC, and when offered a reward, had asked for part of the conquered <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thracian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thrace</b></span> territory. Although this was granted, <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span>'s ambition alarmed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>'s advisors, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> was thus further 'rewarded' by being compelled to remain in <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span> as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>'s "Royal Table-Companion".[20] Taking over from <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> was faced with bubbling discontent in <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>. In 500 BC, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> was approached by some exiles from <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>, who asked him to take control of the island.[21] Seeing an opportunity to strengthen his position in <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> by conquering <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> approached the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>, with a proposal. If <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> provided an army, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> would conquer the island, thus extending the boundaries of the empire for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>, and he would then give <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> a share of the spoils to cover the cost of raising the army.[22] <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> agreed in principle, and asked <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> for permission to launch the expedition. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> assented to this, and a force of 200 triremes was assembled in order to attack <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span> the following year.[23]
<br>
<br>In the spring of 499 BC, <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> readied the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> force, and placed his cousin <span style='color: blue'><b>Megabates</b></span> in command.[23] He then sent ships on to <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, where the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> troops levied by <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> embarked, and the force then set sail for <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>.[24]
<br>
<br>The expedition quickly descended into a debacle. <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> fell out with <span style='color: blue'><b>Megabates</b></span> on the journey towards <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> says that <span style='color: blue'><b>Megabates</b></span> then sent messengers to <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>, warning the Naxians of the force's intention.[24] It is also possible, however, that this story was spread by <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> after the event, by way of a justification for the subsequent failure of the campaign.[1] At any rate, the Naxians were able to prepare properly for a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span>, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> arrived to a well-defended expedition.[25] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> laid <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span> to the Naxians for four months, but eventually they and <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> both ran out of money. The force sailed back to the mainland without a victory.[25]
<br>
<br>With the failure of his attempt to conquer <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> found himself in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dire straits</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dire_Straits</b></span>; he was unable to repay <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>, and had, moreover, alienated himself from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> royal family. He fully expected to be stripped of his position by <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>. In a desperate attempt to save himself, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> chose to incite his own subjects, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span>, to revolt against their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> masters, thereby beginning the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>.[26]

<br>In autumn 499 BC, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> held a meeting with the members of his faction in <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>. He declared that in his opinion the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> should revolt, to which all but the historian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hecataeus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hecataeus_of_Miletus</b></span> agreed.[27] At the same time, a messenger sent by <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> arrived in <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, imploring <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> to rebel against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> suggests that this was because <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> was desperate to return to <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>, and thought he would be sent to <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> if there was a rebellion.[26] <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> therefore openly declared his revolt against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>, abdicated from his role as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span>, and declared <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> to be a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span>.[28] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> has no doubt that this was only a pretence on <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>'s part of giving up power. Rather it was designed to make the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> enthusiastically join the rebellion.[29] The army that had been sent to <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span> was still assembled at <span style='color: blue'><b>Myus</b></span>[27] and included contingents from other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> (i.e. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aeolia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thessaly</b></span> and Doris) as well as men from <span style='color: blue'><b>Mytilene</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mylasa</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Milas</b></span>, Termera and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyme</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cumae</b></span>.[29] <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> sent men to capture all the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> tyrants present in the army and handed them over to their respective cities in order to gain the cooperation of those cities.[29] <span style='color: blue'><b>Bury</b></span> and Meiggs stated that the handovers were done without bloodshed with the exception of <span style='color: blue'><b>Mytilene</b></span>, whose <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> was stoned to death; tyrants elsewhere were simply banished.[30][31] It has also been suggested (<span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> does not explicitly say so) that <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> incited the whole army to join his revolt,[1] and also took possession of the ships that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> had supplied.[28] If the latter is true, it may explain the length of time it took for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> to launch a naval assault on <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>, since they would have needed to build a new fleet.[32]
<br>
<br>Although <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> presents the revolt as a consequence of <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span>'s personal motives, it is clear that <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> must have been ripe for rebellion anyway. The primary grievance was the tyrants installed by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[1] While <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> states had in the past often been ruled by tyrants, this was a form of government on the decline. Moreover, past tyrants had tended (and needed) to be strong and able leaders, whereas the rulers appointed by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were simply the representatives of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. Backed by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> military might, these tyrants did not need the support of the population, and could thus rule absolutely.[1] <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>'s actions have thus been likened to tossing a flame into a kindling box; they incited rebellion across <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>, and tyrannies were everywhere abolished, and democracies established in their place.[28]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> had brought all of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> into revolt, but evidently realised that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> would need other allies in order to successfully fight the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[31][33] In the winter of 499 BC, he first sailed to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, the pre-eminent <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> state in matters of war. However, despite <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>'s entreaties, the Spartan king <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span> turned down the offer to lead the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> therefore turned instead to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>.[33]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> had recently become a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span>, overthrowing its own <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span>. In their fight to establish the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span>, the Athenians had asked the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> for aid (which was not in the end needed), in return for submitting to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> overlordship.[34] Some years later, <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span> had attempted to regain power in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, assisted by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>. This attempt failed and <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span> fled to <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>, and tried to persuade him to subjugate <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>.[35] The Athenians dispatched ambassadors to <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> to dissuade him from taking action, but <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> merely instructed the Athenians to take <span style='color: blue'><b>Hippias</b></span> back as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span>.[33] Needless to say, the Athenians had baulked at this, and resolved instead to be openly at war with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[35] Since they were already an enemy of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> was already in a position to support the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> cities in their revolt.[33] The fact that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> democracies were inspired by the example of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span> no doubt helped persuade the Athenians to support the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>, especially since the cities of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> were (supposedly) originally <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> colonies.[33]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> was also successful in persuading the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> to send assistance to the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> for reasons that are not completely clear. Possibly commercial reasons were a factor; <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> was a mercantile <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>, whose trade was threatened by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> dominance of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span>.[33] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> suggests that the Eretrians supported the revolt in order to repay the support the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> had given <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> some time previously, possibly referring to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lelantine War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lelantine_War</b></span>.[36] The Athenians sent twenty triremes to <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, reinforced by five from <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> described the arrival of these ships as the beginning of troubles between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and barbarians.[37]
<br>
<br>Over the winter, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> continued to foment rebellion. In one incident, he told a group of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Paeonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Paeonia_(kingdom)</b></span> (originally from <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span>), who <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> had brought to live in <span style='color: blue'><b>Phrygia</b></span>, to return to their homeland. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> says that his only purpose in doing this was to vex the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> high command.[38]
<br>
<br>In the spring of 498 BC, an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> force of twenty triremes, accompanied by five from <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>, set sail for <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>.[32] They joined up with the main <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> force near <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephesus</b></span>.[39] Declining to personally lead the force, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> appointed his brother Charopinus and another <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span>, Hermophantus, as generals.[36]
<br>
<br>This force was then guided by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ephesians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephesus</b></span> through the mountains to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>'s satrapal capital.[32] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> caught the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> unaware, and were able to capture the lower <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>. However, <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> still held the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>citadel</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Citadel</b></span> with a significant force of men.[39] The lower <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> then caught on fire, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> suggests accidentally, which quickly spread. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>citadel</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Citadel</b></span>, being surrounded by a burning <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>, emerged into the market-place of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>, where they fought with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, forcing them back. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, demoralised, then retreated from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>, and began to make their way back to <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephesus</b></span>.[40]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> reports that when <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> heard of the burning of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>, he swore vengeance upon the Athenians (after asking who they indeed were), and tasked a servant with reminding him three times each day of his vow: "Master, remember the Athenians".[41]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> says that when the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> heard of the attack on <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>, they gathered together, and marched to the relief of <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>.[42] When they arrived at <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>, they found the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> recently departed. So they followed their tracks back towards <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephesus</b></span>.[42] They caught up with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> outside <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephesus</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> were forced to turn and prepare to fight.[42] <span style='color: blue'><b>Holland</b></span> suggests that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were primarily <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> (hence their ability to catch up with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>).[32] The typical <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> of the time were probably <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>missile</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Missile</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>, whose tactics were to wear down a static enemy with volley after volley.[43]
<br>
<br>It is clear that the demoralised and tired <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> were no match for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, and were completely routed in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> which ensued at <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephesus</b></span>.[32][42] Many were killed, including the Eretrian general, Eualcides.[42] The <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> who escaped the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> made for their own cities, while the remaining Athenians and Eretrians managed to return to their ships and sailed back to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[32][42]
<br>
<br>The Athenians now ended their alliance with the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span>, since the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> had proved to be anything but the easy prey that <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> had described.[44] However, the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> remained committed to their rebellion and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> did not seem to follow up their victory at <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephesus</b></span>.[44] Presumably these ad hoc forces were not equipped to lay <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span> to any of the cities. Despite the defeat at <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephesus</b></span>, the revolt actually spread further. The <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> sent men to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Propontis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sea_of_Marmara</b></span> and captured <span style='color: blue'><b>Byzantium</b></span> and the other nearby cities.[44] They also persuaded the <span style='color: blue'><b>Carians</b></span> to join the rebellion.[44] Furthermore, seeing the spread of the rebellion, the kingdoms of <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyprus</b></span> also revolted against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule without any outside persuasion.[45]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s narrative after the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephesus</b></span> is ambiguous in its exact chronology; historians generally place <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephesus</b></span> in 498 BC.[32][46] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> next describes the spread of the revolt (thus also in 498 BC), and says that the Cypriots had one year of freedom, therefore placing the action in <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyprus</b></span> to 497 BC.[47] He next says that
<br>
<br>"Daurises, Hymaees, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Otanes</b></span>, all of them <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> generals and married to daughters of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>, pursued those <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> who had marched to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>, and drove them to their ships. After this victory they divided the cities among themselves and sacked them."[47]
<br>
<br>This passage implies these <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> generals counter-attacked immediately after the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephesus</b></span>. However, the cities that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> describes Daurises as besieging were on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span>,[48] which (by <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s own <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>reckoning</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Devil_(Dungeons_&_Dragons)</b></span>) did not become involved in the revolt until after <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephesus</b></span>. It is therefore easiest to reconcile the account by assuming that Daurises, Hymaees, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Otanes</b></span> waited until the next campaigning season (i.e. 497 BC), before going on the counter-offensive. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> actions that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> describes at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> and in <span style='color: blue'><b>Caria</b></span> seem to be in the same year, and most commentators place them in 497 BC.[46]
<br>
<br>In <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyprus</b></span>, all the kingdoms had revolted except that of <span style='color: blue'><b>Amathus</b></span>. The leader of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cypriot</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyprus</b></span> revolt was <span style='color: blue'><b>Onesilus</b></span>, brother of the king of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Gorgus</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Gorgus</b></span> did not want to revolt, so <span style='color: blue'><b>Onesilus</b></span> locked his brother out of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> and made himself king. <span style='color: blue'><b>Gorgus</b></span> went over to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Onesilus</b></span> persuaded the other Cypriots, apart from the Amathusians, to revolt. He then settled down to besiege <span style='color: blue'><b>Amathus</b></span>.[45]
<br>
<br>The following year (497 BC), <span style='color: blue'><b>Onesilus</b></span> (still besieging <span style='color: blue'><b>Amathus</b></span>), heard that a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> force under Artybius had been dispatched to <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyprus</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Onesilus</b></span> thus sent messengers to <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>, asking them to send reinforcements, which they did, "in great force".[49] A <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army eventually arrived in <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyprus</b></span>, supported by a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenician</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span> fleet. The <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> opted to fight at sea and defeated the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenicians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span>.[50] In the simultaneous land <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, the Cypriots gained an initial advantage, killing Artybius. However, the defection of two contingents to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> crippled their cause, they were routed and <span style='color: blue'><b>Onesilus</b></span> was killed. The revolt in <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyprus</b></span> was thus crushed and the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> sailed home.[51]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> forces in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> seem to have been reorganised in 497 BC, with three of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>'s sons-in-law, Daurises, Hymaees, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Otanes</b></span>, taking charge of three armies.[46] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> suggests that these generals divided up the rebellious lands between themselves and then set out to attack their respective areas.[47]
<br>
<br>Daurises, who seems to have had the largest army, initially took his army to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span>.[46] There, he systematically besieged and took the cities of <span style='color: blue'><b>Dardanus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Abydos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_recurring_alien_characters_in_Stargate_SG-1</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Percote</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Lampsacus</b></span> and Paesus, each in a single day according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>.[48] However, when he heard that the <span style='color: blue'><b>Carians</b></span> were revolting, he moved his army southwards to attempt to crush this new rebellion.[48] This places the timing of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Carian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Carians</b></span> revolt to early 497 BC.[46]
<br>
<br>Hymaees went to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Propontis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sea_of_Marmara</b></span> and took the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Cius</b></span>. After Daurises moves his forces towards <span style='color: blue'><b>Caria</b></span>, Hymaees marched towards the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> and captured many of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aeolian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aeolians</b></span> cities as well as some of the cities in the <span style='color: blue'><b>Troad</b></span>. However, he then fell ill and died, ending his campaign.[52] Meanwhile, <span style='color: blue'><b>Otanes</b></span>, together with <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>, campaigned in <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> (see below).[53]
<br>
<br>Hearing that the <span style='color: blue'><b>Carians</b></span> had rebelled, Daurises led his army south into <span style='color: blue'><b>Caria</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue'><b>Carians</b></span> gathered at the "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>White</span> <span style='color: green'><b>White_movement</b></span> Pillars", on the <span style='color: blue'><b>Marsyas</b></span> River (the modern <span style='color: blue'><b>Çine</b></span>), a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tributary</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tribute</b></span> of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Meander</b></span>.[54] Pixodorus, a relative of the king of <span style='color: blue'><b>Cilicia</b></span>, suggested that the <span style='color: blue'><b>Carians</b></span> should cross the river and fight with it at their backs, so as to prevent retreat and thus make them fight more bravely. This idea was rejected and the <span style='color: blue'><b>Carians</b></span> made the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> cross the river to fight them.[54] The ensuing <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> was, according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, a long affair, with the <span style='color: blue'><b>Carians</b></span> fighting obstinately before eventually succumbing to the weight of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> numbers. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> suggests that 10,000 <span style='color: blue'><b>Carians</b></span> and 2,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> died in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>.[55]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The survivors</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Daleks</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Marsyas</b></span> fell back to a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sacred grove</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sacred_grove</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Zeus</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Labraunda</b></span> and deliberated whether to surrender to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> or to flee <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> altogether.[55] However, while deliberating, they were joined by a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> army, and with these reinforcements resolved instead to carry on fighting. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> then attacked the army at <span style='color: blue'><b>Labraunda</b></span>, and inflicted an even heavier defeat, with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> suffering particularly bad casualties.[56]
<br>
<br>After the double victory over the <span style='color: blue'><b>Carians</b></span>, Daurises began the task of reducing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Carian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Carians</b></span> strongholds. The <span style='color: blue'><b>Carians</b></span> resolved to fight on, and decided to lay an ambush for Daurises on the road through <span style='color: blue'><b>Pedasus</b></span>.[57] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> implies that this occurred more or less directly after <span style='color: blue'><b>Labraunda</b></span>, but it has also been suggested that <span style='color: blue'><b>Pedasus</b></span> occurred the following year (496 BC), giving the <span style='color: blue'><b>Carians</b></span> time to regroup.[46] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> arrived at <span style='color: blue'><b>Pedasus</b></span> during the night, and the ambush was sprung to great effect. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army was annihilated and Daurises and the other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> commanders were slain.[57] The disaster at <span style='color: blue'><b>Pedasus</b></span> seems to have created a stalemate in the land campaign, and there was apparently little further campaigning in 496 BC and 495 BC.[46]
<br>
<br>The third <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army, under the command of <span style='color: blue'><b>Otanes</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>, attacked <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aeolia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thessaly</b></span>.[58] They re-took <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Clazomenae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Klazomenai</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyme</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cumae</b></span>, probably in 497 BC, but then seem to have been less active in 496 BC and 495 BC, probably as a result of the calamity in <span style='color: blue'><b>Caria</b></span>.[46]
<br>
<br>At the height of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> counter-offensive, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>, sensing his untenable position, decided to abandon his responsibilities as leader of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> and of the revolt. He left <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> with all the members of his faction who would accompany him, and went to the part of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span> that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> had granted to <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> after the campaign of 513 BC.[59] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, who evidently has a rather negative view of him, suggests that <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> simply lost his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>nerve</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nerve_agent</b></span> and fled. Some modern historians have suggested that he went to <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span> to exploit the greater natural resources of the region, and thus support the revolt.[1] Others have suggested that finding himself at the centre of an internal conflict in <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, he chose to go into exile rather than exacerbate the situation.[46]
<br>
<br>In <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span>, he took control of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> that <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> had founded, Myrcinus (site of the later <span style='color: blue'><b>Amphipolis</b></span>), and started campaigning against the local <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thracian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thrace</b></span> population.[59] However, during one campaign, probably in either 497 BC or 496 BC, he was killed by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thracians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thrace</b></span>.[60] <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> was the one man who might have been able to provide the revolt with a sense of purpose, but after his death the revolt was left effectively leaderless.[32][46]
<br>
<br>Shortly after this, <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> was released from his duties in <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span> by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> and sent to <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>. He had persuaded <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> to let him travel to <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> by promising to make the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> end their revolt. However, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> leaves us in no doubt that his real aim was simply to escape his quasi-captivity in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[61] When he arrived in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> directly accused him of fomenting the rebellion with <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>: "I will tell you, <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span>, the truth of this business: it was you who stitched this <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>shoe</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Shoemaking</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> who put it on."[62] <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> fled that night to <span style='color: blue'><b>Chios</b></span> and eventually made his way back to <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>.[63] However, having just got rid of one <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> were in no mood to receive <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> back. He therefore went to <span style='color: blue'><b>Mytilene</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Lesbos</b></span> and persuaded the Lesbians to give him eight triremes. He set sail for <span style='color: blue'><b>Byzantium</b></span> with all those who would follow him. There he established himself, seizing all ships that attempted to sail through the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bosporus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bosphorus</b></span>, unless they agreed to serve him.[63]
<br>
<br>By the sixth year of the revolt (494 BC), the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> forces had regrouped. The available land forces were gathered into one army, and were accompanied by a fleet supplied by the re-subjugated Cypriots, along with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span>, Cilicians and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenicians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> headed directly to <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, paying little attention to other strongholds, presumably intending to tackle the revolt at its <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>epicentre</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Epicenter</b></span>.[64] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> general Datis, an expert on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> affairs, was certainly dispatched to <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> at this time. It is therefore possible that he was in overall command of this <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> offensive.[1]
<br>
<br>Hearing of the approach of this force, the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> met at the <span style='color: blue'><b>Panionium</b></span>, and decided not to attempt to fight on land, leaving the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> to defend their walls. Instead, they opted to gather every ship they could and make for the island of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span>, off the coast of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, in order to "fight for <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> at sea".[64] The <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> were joined by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aeolian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aeolians</b></span> islanders from <span style='color: blue'><b>Lesbos</b></span>, and altogether they had 353 triremes.[65]
<br>
<br>According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> commanders were concerned that they would not be able to defeat the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> fleet and, therefore, would not be able to take <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>. So they sent the exiled <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> tyrants to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span>, where each tried to persuade his fellow citizens to desert to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[66] This approach was initially unsuccessful,[67] but in the week-long delay before the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, divisions arose in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> camp.[68] These divisions led to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Samians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Samos</b></span> secretly agreeing to the terms offered by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, but remained with the other <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> for the time being.[69]
<br>
<br>Soon after, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet moved to attack the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span>, who sailed out to meet them. However, as the two sides neared each other, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Samians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Samos</b></span> sailed away back to <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span>, as they had agreed with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. The Lesbians, seeing their neighbours in the battle-line sail away, promptly fled as well, causing the rest of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> line to dissolve.[70] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chios</b></span>, together with a small number of ships from other cities, stubbornly remained and fought the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, but most of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> fled to their cities.[71] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chios</b></span> fought valiantly, at one point breaking the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> line and capturing many ships, but sustaining many losses of their own; eventually the remaining <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chios</b></span> ships sailed away, thereby ending the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>.[72]
<br>
<br>With the defeat of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> fleet, the revolt was effectively over. <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> was closely invested, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> "mining the walls and using every device against it, until they utterly captured it". According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, most of the men were killed, and the women and children were enslaved.[73] Archaeological evidence partially substantiates this, showing widespread signs of destruction, and abandonment of much of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> in the aftermath of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span>.[46] However, some <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> did remain in (or quickly returned to) <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, though the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> would never recapture its former greatness.[1]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> was thus notionally "left empty of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span>";[74] the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> took the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> and coastal land for themselves, and gave the rest of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> territory to <span style='color: blue'><b>Carians</b></span> from <span style='color: blue'><b>Pedasus</b></span>.[75] The captive <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> were brought before <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span>, who settled them at "Ampé"[76] on the coast of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian Gulf</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persian_Gulf</b></span>, near the mouth of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Tigris</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Many <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Samians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Samos</b></span> were appalled by the actions of their generals at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span>, and resolved to emigrate before their old <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeaces</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span>, returned to rule them. They accepted an invitation from the people of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zancle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Messina</b></span> to settle on the coast of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicily</b></span>, and took with them the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> who had managed to escape from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[74] <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span> itself was spared from destruction by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> because of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Samian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Samos</b></span> defection at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span>.[77] Most of <span style='color: blue'><b>Caria</b></span> now surrendered to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, although some strongholds had to be captured through force.[77]
<br>
<br>When <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> heard of the fall of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, he seems to have appointed himself as leader of the resistance against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[46] Setting out from <span style='color: blue'><b>Byzantium</b></span> with his force of Lesbians, he sailed to <span style='color: blue'><b>Chios</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chios</b></span> refused to receive him, so he attacked and destroyed the remnants of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chios</b></span> fleet. Crippled by the two defeats at sea, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chios</b></span> then acquiesced to <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span>'s leadership.[78]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> now gathered a large force of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeolians</b></span> and went to besiege <span style='color: blue'><b>Thasos</b></span>. However, he then received the news that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet was setting out from <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> to attack the rest of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>, so he quickly returned to <span style='color: blue'><b>Lesbos</b></span>.[79] In order to feed his army, he led foraging expeditions to the mainland near <span style='color: blue'><b>Atarneus</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Myus</b></span>. A large <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> force under <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> was in the area and eventually intercepted one foraging expedition near Malene. The ensuing <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> was hard fought, but was ended by a successful <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> charge, routing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> line.[80] <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> himself surrendered to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, thinking that he would be able to talk himself into a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pardon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pardon</b></span> from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>. However, he was taken to <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> instead, who, fully aware of <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span>'s past treachery, impaled him and then sent his embalmed head to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>.[81]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet and army wintered at <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, before setting out in 493 BC to finally stamp out the last <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>embers</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Embers</b></span> of the revolt. They attacked and captured the islands of <span style='color: blue'><b>Chios</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Lesbos</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Tenedos</b></span>. On each, they made a 'human-net' of troops and swept across the whole island to flush out any hiding rebels.[82] They then moved over to the mainland and captured each of the remaining cities of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>, similarly seeking out any remaining rebels.[82] Although the cities of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> were undoubtedly harrowed in the aftermath, none seems to have suffered quite the fate of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> says that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> chose the most handsome boys from each <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>castrated</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Political_mutilation_in_Byzantine_culture</b></span> them, and chose the most <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>beautiful girls</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Beautiful_Girls</b></span> and sent them away to the king's <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>harem</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Harem</b></span>, and then burnt the temples of the cities.[83] While this is possibly true, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> also probably exaggerates the scale of devastation.[1] In a few years, the cities had more-or-less returned to normal and they were able to equip a large fleet for the second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, just 13 years later.[1][84]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army then re-conquered the settlements on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Asia</b></span> side of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Propontis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sea_of_Marmara</b></span>, while the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet sailed up the European coast of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span>, taking each settlement in turn. With all of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> now firmly returned to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule, the revolt was finally over.[85]
<br>
<br>Once the inevitable punishment of the rebels had occurred, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were in the mood for conciliation. Since these regions were now <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> territory again, it made no sense to harm their economies further or to drive the people to further rebellions. <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> thus set out to re-establish a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>workable</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Workable_FC</b></span> relationship with his subjects.[86] He summoned representatives from each <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>, and told them that henceforth, rather than continually quarrelling and fighting between themselves, disputes would be resolved by arbitration, seemingly by a panel of judges.[46] Furthermore, he re-surveyed the land of each <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>, and set their tribute level in proportion to its size.[87] <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> had also witnessed just how much the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> disliked tyrannies, and began to reconsider his position on the local governance of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>.[86] The following year, <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>, another son-in-law of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>, would travel to <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> and abolish the tyrannies, replacing them with democracies.[88] The peace established by <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> would long be remembered as just and fair.[86] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> actively encouraged the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> nobility of the area to participate in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> religious practices, especially those dealing with <span style='color: blue'><b>Apollo</b></span>.<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>[89</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Effects_of_Hurricane_Sandy_in_New_York</b></span>] Records from the period indicate that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> nobility began to intermarry, and the children of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> nobles were given <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> names instead of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> names. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>' conciliatory policies were used as a type of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>propaganda</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Propaganda</b></span> campaign against the mainland <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, so that in 491 BC, when <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> sent heralds throughout <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> demanding submission (earth and water), initially most city-states accepted the offer, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> being the most prominent exceptions.[90]
<br>
<br>For the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, the only unfinished business that remained by the end of 493 BC was to exact punishment on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> for supporting the revolt.[86] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> had severely threatened the stability of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>'s empire, and the states of mainland <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> would continue to threaten that stability unless dealt with. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> thus began to contemplate the complete conquest of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, beginning with the destruction of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>.[86]
<br>
<br>Therefore, the first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> effectively began in the following year, 492 BC, when <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> was dispatched (via <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>) to complete the pacification of the land approaches to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and push on to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> if possible.[88] <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span> was re-subjugated, having broken loose from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule during the revolts and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span> compelled to become a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vassal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vassal</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. However, progress was halted by a naval disaster.[88] A second expedition was launched in 490 BC under Datis and <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>, son of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>. This amphibious force sailed across the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span>, subjugating the <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyclades</b></span>, before arriving off <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> was besieged, captured and destroyed, and the force then moved onto <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>. Landing at the Bay of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, they were met by an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> army and defeated in the famous Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, ending the first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> attempt to subdue <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[91]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> was primarily of significance as the opening chapter in, and causative agent of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, which included the two invasions of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and the famous battles of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>.[1] For the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> cities themselves, the revolt ended in failure, and substantial losses, both material and economic. However, <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> aside, they recovered relatively quickly and prospered under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule for the next forty years.[1] For the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, the revolt was significant in drawing them into an extended conflict with the states of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> which would last for fifty years, over which time they would sustain considerable losses.[92]
<br>
<br>Militarily, it is difficult to draw too many conclusions from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>, save for what the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> may (or may not) have learnt about each other. Certainly, the Athenians, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> in general, seem to have been impressed by the power of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>, with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> armies displaying considerable caution during the following campaigns when confronted by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>.[93][94] Conversely, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> seem not to have realised or noticed the potential of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>heavy infantry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Heavy_infantry</b></span>. At the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, in 490 BC, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> took little heed of a primarily hoplitic army, resulting in their defeat. Furthermore, despite the possibility of recruiting <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>heavy infantry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Heavy_infantry</b></span> from their domains, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> began the second invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> without doing so, and again encountered major problems in the face of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> armies.[95] It is possible that, given the ease of their victories over the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephesus</b></span>, and similarly armed forces at the battles of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Marsyas</b></span> River and <span style='color: blue'><b>Labraunda</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> simply disregarded the military value of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>phalanx</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalanx</b></span>
