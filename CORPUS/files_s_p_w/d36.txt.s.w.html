The Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span>  was a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>naval battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naval_warfare</b></span> which occurred during the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>, in 494 BC. It was fought between an alliance of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> cities (joined by the Lesbians) and the Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> the Great, and resulted in a decisive victory for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> which all but ended the revolt.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> was triggered by the dissatisfaction of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> with the tyrants appointed by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> to rule them. In 499 BC, the then-tyrant of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>, launched a joint expedition with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> to conquer <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>, in an attempt to bolster his position in <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>. The mission was a debacle, and sensing his imminent removal as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> chose to incite the whole of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> into rebellion against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> king <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> the Great. Initially, in 498 BC, the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> went on the offensive, supported by troops from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>, capturing <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>, before suffering defeat at the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephesus</b></span>. The revolt then spread to <span style='color: blue'><b>Caria</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyprus</b></span>. Three years of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> campaigning across <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> followed, with no decisive effect. By 494 BC the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army and navy had regrouped, and made straight for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>epicentre</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Epicenter</b></span> of the rebellion at <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> sought to defend <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> by sea, leaving the defense of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> fleet gathered at the island of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span>, off the coast of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> were uncertain of victory at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span>, so attempted to persuade some of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> contingents to defect. Although this was unsuccessful at first, when the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> finally attacked the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Samian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Samos</b></span> fleet accepted the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> offer. As the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> fleets met, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Samians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Samos</b></span> sailed away from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, causing the collapse of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> line. Although the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chios</b></span> contingent and a few other ships remained and fought bravely against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> was lost.
<br>
<br>With the defeat at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> was all but ended. The next year, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> reduced the last rebel strongholds, and began the process of bringing peace to the region. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> constituted the first major conflict between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ancient Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, and as such represents the first phase of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>. Although <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> had been brought back into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fold, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> vowed to punish <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> for their support of the revolt. Moreover, seeing that the myriad <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> states of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> posed a continued threat to the stability of his empire, he decided to conquer the whole of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. In 492 BC, the first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, the next phase of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, would begin as a direct consequence of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Practically the only primary source for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> is the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>.[1] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, who has been called the 'Father of History',[2] was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> (then under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> overlordship). He wrote his 'Enquiries' (Greek—Historia; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>English</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kingdom_of_England</b></span>—(The) <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span>) around 440–430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ending in 450 BC).[3] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented 'history' as we know it.[3] As <span style='color: blue'><b>Holland</b></span> has it: "For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>manifest destiny</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Manifest_destiny</b></span>, but rather explanations he could verify personally."[3]
<br>
<br>Some subsequent ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, starting with <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>.[4][5] Nevertheless, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> chose to begin his history where <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> left off (at the Siege of Sestos), and therefore evidently felt that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting.[5] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> criticised <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> in his essay "On The Malignity of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>", describing <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> as "Philobarbaros" (barbarian-lover), for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed.[6] A negative view of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> was passed on to <span style='color: blue'><b>Renaissance</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>, though he remained well read.[7] However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaeological finds which have repeatedly confirmed his version of events.[8] The prevailing modern view is that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> generally did a remarkable job in his Historia, but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>skepticism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Skepticism</b></span>.[8] Nevertheless, there are still some historians who believe <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> made up much of his story.[9]
<br>
<br>In the dark age that followed the collapse of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycenaean civilization</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mycenaean_Greece</b></span>, significant numbers of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> had emigrated to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> and settled there. These settlers were from three tribal groups: the <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeolians</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Dorians</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span>.[10] The <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> had settled about the coasts of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Caria</b></span>, founding the twelve cities which made up <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>.[10] These cities were <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Myus</b></span> and Priene in <span style='color: blue'><b>Caria</b></span>; <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephesus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Colophon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Colophon_(city)</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lebedos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lebedus</b></span>, Teos, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Clazomenae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Klazomenai</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Phocaea</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Erythrae</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span>; and the islands of <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Chios</b></span>.[11] The cities of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> had remained independent until they were conquered by the famous <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> king <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span>, in around 560 BC.[12] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> cities then remained under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> rule until <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span> was in turn conquered by the nascent Achaemenid <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>.[13] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> found the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> difficult to rule. Elsewhere in the empire, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> was able to identify elite native groups to help him rule his new subjects—such as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>priesthood</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Clergy</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Judea</b></span>.[14] No such group existed in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities at this time; while there was usually an aristocracy, this was inevitably divided into feuding factions.[14] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> thus settled for the sponsoring a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> in each <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>, even though this drew them into the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span>' internal conflicts. Furthermore, a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> might develop an independent streak, and have to be replaced.[14] The tyrants themselves faced a difficult task; they had to deflect the worst of their fellow citizens' hatred, while staying in the favour of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[14]
<br>
<br>About 40 years after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> conquest of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>, and in the reign of the fourth <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> king, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> the Great, the stand-in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> found himself in this familiar <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>predicament</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Predicament</b></span>.[15] In 500 BC, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> was approached by some exiles from <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>, who asked him to take control of the island.[16] Seeing an opportunity to strengthen his position in <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> by conquering <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> approached the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>, proposing a joint attack on <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>, to which <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> assented.[17]
<br>
<br>The expedition sailed in the spring of 499 BC but quickly descended into a debacle[18] The force laid <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span> to the Naxians for four months, but eventually the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> both ran out of money. The force therefore sailed despondently back to the mainland.[19] <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> found himself in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dire straits</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dire_Straits</b></span> and fully expected to be stripped of his position by <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>. In a desperate attempt to save himself, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> chose to incite his own subjects, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span>, to revolt against their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> masters, thereby beginning the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>.[20] Although <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> presents the revolt as a consequence of <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>'s personal motives, it is clear that <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> must have been ripe for rebellion anyway, the primary grievance being the tyrants installed by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[1] <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>'s actions have thus been likened to tossing a flame into a kindling box; they incited rebellion across <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> (and <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeolis</b></span> and Doris), and tyrannies were everywhere abolished, and democracies established in their place.[21]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> had brought all of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> into revolt, but evidently realised that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> would need other allies in order to fight the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[22] In the winter of 499 BC, he sailed to mainland <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> to try to recruit allies. He failed to persuade the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, but the cities of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> agreed to support the rebellion.[22] In the spring of 498 BC, an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> force of twenty triremes, accompanied by five from <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>, for a total of twenty-five triremes set sail for <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>.[23] They joined up with the main <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> force near <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephesus</b></span>.[24] This force was then guided by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ephesians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephesus</b></span> through mountains to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>'s satrapal capital.[23] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> caught the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> unawares, and were able to capture the lower <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>. However the lower <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> then caught fire, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, demoralised, then retreated from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>, and began to make their way back to <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephesus</b></span>.[25] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> troops in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> followed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> force, catching them outside <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephesus</b></span>. It is clear that the demoralised and tired <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> were no match for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, and were completely routed in the ensuing <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephesus</b></span>.[23] The <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> who escaped the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> made for their own cities, while the remaining Athenians and Eretrians managed to return to their ships, and sailed back to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[23][26]
<br>
<br>Despite these setbacks, the revolt spread further. The <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> sent men to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Propontis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sea_of_Marmara</b></span>, and captured <span style='color: blue'><b>Byzantium</b></span> and the other nearby cities.[27] They also persuaded the <span style='color: blue'><b>Carians</b></span> to join the rebellion.[27] Furthermore, seeing the spread of the rebellion, the kingdoms of <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyprus</b></span> also revolted against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule without any outside persuasion.[28] For the next three years, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army and navy were fully occupied with fighting the rebellions in <span style='color: blue'><b>Caria</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyprus</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> seems to have had an uneasy peace during these years.[29] At the height of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> counter-offensive, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>, sensing the untenability of his position, decided to abandon his position as leader of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, and of the revolt, and he left <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, who evidently has a rather negative view of him, suggests that <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> simply lost his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>nerve</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nerve_agent</b></span> and fled.[30]
<br>
<br>By the sixth year of the revolt (494 BC), the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> forces had regrouped. The available land forces were gathered into one army, and were accompanied by a fleet supplied by the re-subjugated Cypriots, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span>, Cilicians and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenicians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> headed directly to <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, paying little attention to other strongholds, presumably intending to tackle the revolt at its <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>epicentre</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Epicenter</b></span>.[31] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> general Datis, an expert on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> affairs, was certainly dispatched to <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> at this time. It is therefore possible that he was in overall command of this <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> offensive.[1] Hearing of the approach of this force, the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> met at the <span style='color: blue'><b>Panionium</b></span> (the sacred meeting ground), and decided not to attempt to fight on land, leaving the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> to defend their walls. Instead, they opted to gather every ship they could, and make for the island of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span>, off the coast of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, in order to "fight for <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> at sea".[31]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> cities were joined in this <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> by the <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeolians</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lesbos</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> lists the number of ships provided by each state:[32]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> gives the order of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> line as being, from east to west; Miletus—Priene—Myus—Teos—Chios—Erythraea—Phocaea—Lesbos—Samos.[32]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> says that there were 600 ships in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet,[33] provided by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenicians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span> (who were most eager to fight), the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span>, Cilicians, and the Cypriots, whose own revolt had recently been subdued.[31] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet may have been commanded by the veteran <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> general Datis; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> records seem to suggest that he was sent by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> to <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> at around about the time of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span>.[29] However, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> does not name any <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> commanders in this campaign.
<br>
<br>When the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> arrived off the coast of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> and learned the number of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> ships, they began to worry that they would not be able to defeat the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, and feared <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>'s wrath should they fail.[33] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> tyrants who had been expelled at the beginning of the revolt were present, and according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, they were now given instructions by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>:
<br>
<br>"Men of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>, let each one of you now show that he has done good service to the king's house; let each one of you try to separate your own countrymen from the rest of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>allied power</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span>. Set this promise before them: they will suffer no harm for their rebellion, neither their temples nor their houses will be burnt, nor will they in any way be treated more violently than before. But if they will not do so and are set on fighting, then utter a threat that will restrain them: if they are defeated in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, they will be enslaved; we will make eunuchs of their boys, and carry their maidens captive to Bactra, and hand over their land to others."[33]
<br>
<br>The tyrants thus sent messages to their own kinsman, but the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> refused the offers. Critically, each group thought that only they had been approached—there does not seem to have been any discussion of this offer between the different contingents, and the possibility for treachery does not seem to have been realised.[33]
<br>

<br>Reconstructed model of a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>trireme</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Trireme</b></span>, the type of ship in use by both the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> forces
<br>The <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> did however hold meetings to discuss the conduct of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dionysius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dionysius_I_of_Syracuse</b></span>, the Phocaean general, offered to train and lead the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> force:
<br>
<br>"Our affairs, men of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>, stand on the edge of a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>razor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Razor</b></span>, whether to be free men or slaves, and runaway slaves at that. If you now consent to endure hardships, you will have toil for the present time, but it will be in your power to overcome your enemies and gain freedom; but if you will be weak and disorderly, I see nothing that can save you from paying the penalty to the king for your rebellion. Believe me and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>entrust</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Entrust</b></span> yourselves to me; I promise you that (if the gods deal fairly with us) either our enemies shall not meet us in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, or if they do they shall be utterly vanquished." [34]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dionysius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dionysius_I_of_Syracuse</b></span> thus began an intensive training program, leading the fleet out every day to train the rowers in ramming manoeuvers, and the marines in combat. For seven days the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> accepted this regime, but being unused to the hard work, they refused to obey thereafter, and stayed in camp instead.[35] According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, upon seeing the resultant discontent and division in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> camp, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Samians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Samos</b></span> decided to accept the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> offer of lenience in return for desertion.[36] However, some modern historians reject the notion of dissent in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek camp</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_Jupiter_trojans_(Greek_camp)</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> derived his account of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Samians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Samos</b></span> themselves, and it is suggested that, seeking to excuse their treachery, they came up with this story.[29] At any rate, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Samians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Samos</b></span> remained with the other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> in the run up to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>.[36]
<br>
<br>Soon after the rebellion against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dionysius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dionysius_I_of_Syracuse</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet moved to attack the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span>, who sailed out to meet them. The ensuing <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> was evidently confused, since <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> admits that "which of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> were brave men or cowards then in that sea-fight I cannot exactly say; for they all blame each other".[37] It is nevertheless clear that very early on in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Samian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Samos</b></span> contingent hoisted their sails, as had been agreed, and fled the battlefield. However, 11 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Samian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Samos</b></span> ships refused to desert the other <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span>, and remained at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>. At some later date, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Samians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Samos</b></span> erected a pillar in their marketplace commemorating the bravery and sacrifice of these crews.[37] Seeing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Samians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Samos</b></span> leave, their neighbours on the western wing, the Lesbians, also fled. The whole west-wing of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> line thus very quickly collapsed.[37] Other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> contingents also fled as the situation became more desperate.
<br>
<br>Only the large <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chios</b></span> navy seems to have stood their ground, perhaps accompanied by a few other ships. They fought valiantly, but had huge casualties.[38] Eventually the remaining <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chios</b></span> ships sailed away back to <span style='color: blue'><b>Chios</b></span>, thereby ending the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>.[39]
<br>
<br>With the defeat of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> fleet, the revolt was effectively over. <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> was closely invested, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> "mining the walls and using every device against it, until they utterly captured it". According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, most of the men were killed, and the women and children were enslaved.[40] Archaeological evidence partially substantiates this, showing widespread signs of destruction, and abandonment of much of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> in the aftermath of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span>.[29] However, some <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> did remain in (or quickly returned to) <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, though the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> would never recapture its former greatness.[1] <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> was thus notionally "left empty of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span>";[41] the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> took the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> and coastal land for themselves, and gave the rest of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> territory to <span style='color: blue'><b>Carians</b></span> from <span style='color: blue'><b>Pedasus</b></span>.[42] The captive <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> were brought before <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span>, who settled them on the coast of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian Gulf</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persian_Gulf</b></span>, near the mouth of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Tigris</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Many <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Samians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Samos</b></span> were appalled by the actions of their generals at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span>, and resolved to emigrate before their old <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeaces</b></span>, returned to rule them. They accepted an invitation from the people of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zancle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Messina</b></span> to settle on the coast of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicily</b></span>, and took with them such <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> as had escaped from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[41] <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span> itself was spared from destruction by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> because of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Samian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Samos</b></span> defection at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span>.[43] Meanwhile, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dionysius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dionysius_I_of_Syracuse</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Phocaea</b></span> went to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicily</b></span>, and established himself as a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pirate</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Piracy</b></span>, preying on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Carthaginian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Carthage</b></span> ships.[43]
<br>
<br>Most of <span style='color: blue'><b>Caria</b></span> surrendered to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> in aftermath of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span>, although some strongholds had to be captured through force.[43] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet and army wintered at <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, before setting out in 493 BC to finally stamp out the last <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>embers</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Embers</b></span> of the revolt. They attacked and captured the islands of <span style='color: blue'><b>Chios</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Lesbos</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Tenedos</b></span> and then moved over to the mainland, and captured each of the remaining cities of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>.[44] Although the cities of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> were undoubtedly harrowed in the aftermath, none seems to have suffered quite the fate of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>.[45] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army then re-conquered the settlements on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Asia</b></span> side of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Propontis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sea_of_Marmara</b></span>, while the fleet sailed up the European coast of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span>, taking each settlement in turn. With all of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> now firmly returned to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule, the revolt was finally over.[46]
<br>
<br>For the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, the only unfinished business that remained by the end of 493 BC was to exact punishment on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> for supporting the revolt.[47] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> had severely threatened the stability of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>'s empire, and the states of mainland <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> would continue to threaten that stability unless dealt with. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> thus began to contemplate the complete conquest of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, beginning with the destruction of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>.[47] The first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> thus began in the following year, 492 BC, when <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> was dispatched (via <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>) to complete the pacification of the land approaches to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, and push on to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> if possible.[48] <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span> was re-subjugated, having broken loose from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule during the revolts, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span> compelled to become a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vassal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vassal</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. However, progress was halted by a naval disaster.[48] A second expedition was launched in 490 BC under Datis and <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>, son of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>. This amphibious force sailed across the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span>, subjugating the <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyclades</b></span>, before arriving off <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> was besieged, captured and destroyed, and the force then moved onto <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>. Landing at the Bay of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, they were met by an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> army, and defeated in the famous Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, ending the first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> attempt to subdue <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>
