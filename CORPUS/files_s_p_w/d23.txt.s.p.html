<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> (c. 555-489 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>) was the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athenian</a> general who defeated the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> at the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Marathon</a> in 490 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> faced a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> force of superior numbers led by the commanding <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Admiral?lang=en'>admiral</a> Datis, who had been sent by their king <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> (549-486 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>) to invade and subjugate <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>. At the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Marathon</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> recognized that traditional <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> strategy would never succeed against the larger <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> force and adopted a completely unexpected  tactic which broke the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> lines, won the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a>, and saved <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> domination.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> was the son of  <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cimon?lang=en'>Cimon</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>, an aristocratic charioteer well known for his success in the Olympics. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cimon?lang=en'>Cimon</a> was a  member of the wealthy and highly regarded <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philaidae?lang=en'>Philaid</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clan?lang=en'>clan</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> was educated by the best teachers and groomed for success in politics. He inherited a kingdom in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Asia Minor</a> in his twenties when his brother, Stesagoras, died without any children to leave his estate to. This kingdom was in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallipoli?lang=en'>Chersonese</a>, north of the site of ancient <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Troy?lang=en'>Troy</a>, and had proved a very prosperous holding for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a>' family. The people, however, had grown tired of the rule of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philaidae?lang=en'>Philaid</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clan?lang=en'>clan</a> prior to his brother's death. They hoped, in fact, that since their king had died without an heir, they would now be left to govern themselves; but this was not to be.
<br>
<br>When <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> arrived in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallipoli?lang=en'>Chersonese</a>, he already knew that he would have trouble with the people and expected tiresome visits from the elders of the community who would attempt to repeatedly outwit and manipulate him. He had no interest in letting them waste his time and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Energy?lang=en'>energy</a>, and so when he took up residence in his new palace, he closed all his doors and shutters and refused to go out among the people, acting as though he was in mourning for the death of his brother.
<br>
<br>When the Chersonesian elders came to his home in a group to offer their condolences on his loss, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> had his guards arrest them on charges of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treason?lang=en'>treason</a>. The elders were imprisoned, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> then set about governing his new kingdom without further interference or annoyance. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> historian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> claims that, unlike his uncle or brother before him, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> saw what needed to be done and did it; thus securing his rule of the kingdom quickly. He consolidated his position soon after this by marrying a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrace?lang=en'>Thracian</a> princess named Hegesipyle, daughter of the neighboring king <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Olorus?lang=en'>Olorus</a>, sealing an alliance against any future troubles.
<br>
<br>Whatever poor policies his brother and uncle had enacted <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> avoided, and proved himself an effective ruler. He defeated the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythians?lang=en'>Scythian</a> invaders who made regular incursions into the kingdom and conquered the islands of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lemnos?lang=en'>Lemnos</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Imbros?lang=en'>Imbros</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tenedos?lang=en'>Tenedos</a> for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>, which greatly elevated his status and that of his kingdom. In 513 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> invaded, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> surrendered accepting his new position as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vassal?lang=en'>vassal</a> to the Persian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire?lang=en'>Empire</a>. In this capacity, he had no choice but to join his new ruler in an expedition against the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythians?lang=en'>Scythians</a>, and then against the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colonies_in_antiquity?lang=en'>Greek colonies</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Asia Minor</a>. These colonies revolted against <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> rule in 499 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> supported them secretly and helped with dispensing further aid from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>.
<br>
<br>When the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> put down the revolt in c. 495 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a>' part in the troubles was revealed, and he fled to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> for safety. His son Metiochus was captured by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> at this time but, because he came of a noble house of a former <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vassal?lang=en'>vassal</a>, his life was spared and he lived very comfortably as a prince in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persia</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> was pursued by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phoenicia?lang=en'>Phoenician</a> allies of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> but evaded them. He reached <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> with the rest of his family, where he was welcomed but then almost instantly brought up on charges of tyranny stemming from his reign in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallipoli?lang=en'>Chersonese</a>. The Athenians dismissed the charges as fabrications of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> sympathizers, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> and his family settled into the comfortable life of upper class <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> could not abide the arrogance of the Athenians or the insult of the colonies' revolt. He sent emissaries to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> city-states demanding their submission to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> rule. Almost all of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> states refused him, but the island of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegina?lang=en'>Aegina</a> agreed and became a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vassal?lang=en'>vassal</a> state. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegina?lang=en'>Aegina</a>, centrally located between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piraeus?lang=en'>Piraeus</a> - the port of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> - and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a> - an important trade center near <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> - threatened the commerce of both city-states as a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vassal?lang=en'>vassal</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> demanded that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegina?lang=en'>Aegina</a> withdrew its pledge to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> king, but <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegina?lang=en'>Aegina</a> refused. The tensions between the city-states flared and gave <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> the excuse he needed to invade <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> in order to protect his new <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vassal?lang=en'>vassal</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> knew that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> had been behind the rebellion and, of course, that they had welcomed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a>, who had betrayed him. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> sent his general <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mardonius?lang=en'>Mardonius</a> to the north of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>, where he conquered the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Macedonians?lang=en'>Macedonian</a> region in 492 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a> but lacked the men and resources to march south on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> itself. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a> then decided to invade mainland <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> and destroy <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> directly, eliminating any further threat to his control of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Asia Minor</a> and avenging himself for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>' <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_civilisations_in_the_Culture_series?lang=en'>affront</a> to his rule.
<br>
<br>The war between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> and the Persian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire?lang=en'>Empire</a> is often depicted strictly along nationalistic lines, where there were <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> on one side of the conflict and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> on the other, but this is not so. As the example of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegina?lang=en'>Aegina</a> illustrates, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> city-states were not unified as a nation, and there were many <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> who favored the unity and protection of the Persian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire?lang=en'>Empire</a>. Although this may seem strange, that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> would prefer <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> rule, it must be remembered that the Persian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire?lang=en'>Empire</a> was the greatest the world had known at the time while the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> city-states were small, independent political units who fought incessantly with each other.
<br>
<br>There was no national <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> army, economy, or even culture; each <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polis?lang=en'>city-state</a> considered itself a nation unto itself. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persia</a> offered a much more stable and all-encompassing <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Social_constructionism?lang=en'>social construct</a> than the city-states of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>, and there were a number of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> who keenly appreciated this. When the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> invaded <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> in 490 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>, they were at first successful due to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Espionage?lang=en'>intelligence</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> sympathizers supplied them with. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Persians?lang=en'>The Persians</a> swiftly captured the strategically important island of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naxos?lang=en'>Naxos</a>, then <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delos?lang=en'>Delos</a>, and then <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eretria?lang=en'>Eretria</a>, whose gates were opened to them by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> supporters, and were then in position to invade the mainland at the port known as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Marathon</a>.
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> hastily mobilized their forces to repel the invasion but, as usual, lacked cohesion, and so a unified army was not ready at hand. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athenian</a> army of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>hoplites</a> was drawn from the citizenry and readied themselves quickly, but of the other city-states, only the Plataeans joined the resistance with a force of 400. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> could not participate because of a religious ritual (though they pledged to join as soon as they could), and the other city-states had their own obligations and problems which prevented them. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> was one of ten generals commanding the largely <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athenian</a> force which eventually marched to meet the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a>. Each day, one of the generals assumed supreme command of the army while a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polemarch?lang=en'>polemarch</a> (a war counselor) named <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Callimachus?lang=en'>Callimachus</a>, who was not one of the ten, would oversee operations and render advice and decisions on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> plans.
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> force under Datis numbered over 20,000 infantry with additional <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>cavalry</a> and other units including archers. Their force also included the elite warriors known as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_NCIS_episodes?lang=en'>The Immortals</a>, so called because when one fell another instantly took his place. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_NCIS_episodes?lang=en'>The Immortals</a> were considered invincible. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>, on the other hand, had only been able to muster 10,000 infantry and had neither <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>cavalry</a> nor archers. The plains of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Marathon</a> were flat and well suited to a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>cavalry</a> charge. The ground also favored the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> archers over the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> infantry.
<br>
<br>Historian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kelly_DeVries?lang=en'>Kelly DeVries</a> notes that "when the Athenians saw the immense size of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> force at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Marathon</a> they wavered in their decision to fight them there. A dispute arose in the war council between those who favored withdrawal, at least until the arrival of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a>, and those who desired to do <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a>" (46-47). <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> was said to be on the march, and additional forces could arrive at any moment; some generals argued they should, therefore, delay any action. Other commanders pointed out how any traditional charge across the open ground at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Marathon</a>, with or without reinforcements, would be extremely difficult because of the strength of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>cavalry</a> and opportunities for their archers. The longer they argued, the stronger the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> position grew, they claimed, and an attack should be mounted without delay.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> favored the latter plan, and historians have speculated that he may have been motivated by revenge for having been driven from his kingdom by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius I</a>. The suggestion that they wait until reinforcements arrived from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> was a reasonable one, and, as it turned out, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> reached <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Marathon</a> the day after the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a>. It has also been noted that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> chose to press for the attack on a day when he would be the supreme commander and so would receive the glory of a decisive victory. His desire for revenge would be understandable, but this motivation as his sole reason for pressing for attack is only speculation. The generals' opinions on whether to attack or delay were divided - with five voting to attack and five to wait - until <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> appealed personally to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Callimachus?lang=en'>Callimachus</a> to render a decision to break the tie. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> reports that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> carefully explained the situation to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Callimachus?lang=en'>Callimachus</a>, saying:
<br>
<br>If we do not fight, I look to see a great disturbance at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> which will shake men's resolutions, and then I fear they will submit themselves, but if we fight the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> before any unsoundness show itself among our citizens, let the gods but give us fair play, and we are able to overcome the enemy. On you therefore we depend in this matter, which lies wholly in your own power. You have only to add your vote to my side and your country will be free, and not free only, but the first state in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a>. Or, if you prefer to give your vote to them who would decline the combat, then the reverse will follow (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Histories</a>, 6.109).
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Callimachus?lang=en'>Callimachus</a> was persuaded and voted on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a>' side. The army then began preparations for attack with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> in command. The problem of how exactly to come at the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> remained, however. To reach the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> lines, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> would have to cover over a mile (1.6 km) of open ground without cover, exposed to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> archers and at the mercy of their <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>cavalry</a>. At this same time, though, word reached <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>cavalry</a> had largely taken ship to attack <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> while the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> army was held at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Marathon</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>cavalry</a> which had been left behind was only a fraction of the larger force which had faced the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> earlier. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> knew this was the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Perfect_Time?lang=en'>perfect time</a> to strike.
<br>
<br>On the eleventh day of the stand-off,  <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> gave orders for the army to break traditional formation and spread themselves out in a thin line, perhaps three-men deep, across the opposing line of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a>. Traditionally, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>hoplite</a> formation would have been a thickly clustered <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalanx?lang=en'>phalanx</a> of warriors who would have marched steadily forward to the beat of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drum?lang=en'>drums</a> and the sound of flutes. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> changed all that; there would be no music and, further, the center of the line would be the weakest. Historians have debated on whether the weak center was intentional or simply the result of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a>' plan to stretch his line across the length of the much larger <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> front. It seems most likely that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> intentionally weakened his center to draw the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> into a trap which was then closed by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_Left?lang=en'>Greek left</a> and right wings.

<br>When his men were in position he commanded they run as fast as they could across the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Plains?lang=en'>plain</a> and attack the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a>. When the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> saw them coming, they only were aware of the weak center section racing madly across the beach and thought the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> must have lost their minds. They were so surprised they had no time to mobilize and place their archers, and with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>cavalry</a> away the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> had also lost that advantage. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> slammed into the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> lines, inflicting severe damages, but the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> struck back, breaking the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> center which then gave way.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Persians?lang=en'>The Persians</a> were now confident of victory and pressed on - not knowing this was precisely <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a>' plan. He now ordered the wings of his army to close on the center and crushed the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> between them. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> forces fled for their ships and, while some escaped, most were killed and the ships captured. The Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Marathon</a> had been won, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> was saved from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> domination. The Athenians lost 192 men in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> while the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> lost 6,400, according to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>. Although <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>' numbers have been challenged repeatedly by many historians through the centuries, there is no doubt the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> was a great victory for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>.
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartans</a> arrived the following day and congratulated the Athenians, but <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> had no time to spare for celebrations. He knew that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> sympathizers were planning on handing <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> over to the enemy and that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> forces would be approaching the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>city</a> swiftly. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> ordered his men to quick march to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>, where they were waiting in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> formation when the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> fleet arrived for the attack. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Persians?lang=en'>The Persians</a> understood they had been outmaneuvered by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> and sailed for home.
<br>
<br>The war had been won, but there was still the matter of those <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a> who had sided with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> to betray their country, most notably <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegina?lang=en'>Aegina</a> and the city-states of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyclades?lang=en'>Cyclades</a>, which had gone over to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persian</a> side. With <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> now secure, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> led his army against the islands of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyclades?lang=en'>Cyclades</a> but was defeated. He was wounded in the leg and retired from combat. After the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a>, his men brought him back to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a>, where he was charged with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treason?lang=en'>treason</a> for his failure and imprisoned. His former service to the Athenians was forgotten in their disappointment at his overwhelming defeat. While in prison, his wound went untreated, and he died from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gangrene?lang=en'>gangrene</a>. His body was buried in a tomb at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Marathon</a>, near those of his men who had fallen in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a>. The site was held in honor for years afterwards but eventually was forgotten. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kelly_DeVries?lang=en'>Kelly DeVries</a> writes:

<br>If one visited the site of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> only a year before the modern Olympics returned to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens?lang=en'>Athens</a> in 2004, one was greeted with a broken monumental <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pedestal?lang=en'>plinth</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Graffiti?lang=en'>graffiti</a> spray-painted on all man-made surfaces, and a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Museum?lang=en'>museum</a> that was rarely visited. The battlefield, on which perhaps the greatest <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient Greece</a>'s history had been fought, was not only neglected, it was abused - all except the two <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tumulus?lang=en'>grave mounds</a> (38).
<br>
<br>The site was cleaned up and restored in preparations for the 2500th anniversary of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>battle</a> in the fall of 2010 and continues to be a popular tourist attraction. The Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Marathon</a> remains one of the most important and often studied/cited of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>ancient Greece</a>. The unlikely victory of the smaller <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greek</a> force and the determination and imagination of their leader has inspired people around the world for centuries. Although <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a>' death in prison was hardly worthy of the great hero of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Marathon</a>, later generations recognized his accomplishments and elevated his name to legendary status. Today, his statue stands near the graves of his men on the plains of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Marathon</a> where he defeated the mighty army of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persia</a> and saved his country. Ten years later, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Persians</a> would again invade <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greece</a> in 480 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Era?lang=en'>BCE</a>, with an even larger force, and would again be defeated by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Greeks</a>, who still remembered the victory at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Marathon</a>
