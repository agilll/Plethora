<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> (/θəˈmɪstəˌkliːz/; <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>: Θεμιστοκλῆς <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> pronunciation: [tʰemistoklɛ̂ːs] Themistoklẽs; "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Perth_Glory_FC?lang=en'>Perth_Glory_FC</a> of the Law";[1] c. 524–<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/459_BC?lang=en'>459_BC</a>) was an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> politician and general. He was one of a new <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog_breed?lang=en'>Dog_breed</a> of non-aristocratic politicians who rose to prominence in the early years of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athenian_democracy?lang=en'>Athenian_democracy</a>. As a politician, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> was a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Populism?lang=en'>Populism</a>, having the support of lower-class Athenians, and generally being at odds with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> nobility. Elected <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archon?lang=en'>Archon</a> in 493 BC, he convinced the polis to increase the naval power of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, a recurring theme in his political career. During the first <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> invasion of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> he fought at the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Battle_of_Marathon</a>[2] (490 BC) and was possibly one of the ten <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strategos?lang=en'>Strategos</a> (generals) in that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a>.[citation needed]
<br>
<br>In the years after <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Battle_of_Marathon</a>, and in the run-up to the second <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> invasion of 480-479 BC, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> became the most prominent politician in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>. He continued to advocate a strong <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Navy?lang=en'>Navy</a>, and in 483 BC he persuaded the Athenians to build a fleet of 200 triremes; these proved crucial in the forthcoming conflict with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>. During the second invasion, he effectively exercised command of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> allied navy at the battles of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Artemisium?lang=en'>Battle_of_Artemisium</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Battle_of_Salamis</a> in 480 BC. Due to subterfuge on the part of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a> lured the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> fleet into the Straits of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Battle_of_Salamis</a>, and the decisive <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> victory there was the turning point in the invasion, which ended the following year with the defeat of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> at the land Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plataea?lang=en'>Plataea</a>.
<br>
<br>After the conflict ended, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> continued his pre-eminence among <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> politicians. However, he aroused the hostility of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> by ordering the re-fortification of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, and his perceived arrogance began to alienate him from the Athenians. In 472 or 471 BC, he was ostracised, and went into exile in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Argos?lang=en'>Argos</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> now saw an opportunity to destroy <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>, and implicated him in the alleged treasonous plot of 478 BC of their own general <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pausanias_of_Sparta?lang=en'>Pausanias_of_Sparta</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> thus fled from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great?lang=en'>Alexander_the_Great</a> I of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Macedonia?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Macedonia</a> (reigned 498-454 BC) temporarily gave him sanctuary at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pydna?lang=en'>Pydna</a> before he traveled to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a>, where he entered the service of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> king <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia?lang=en'>Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia</a> (reigned 465-424 BC). He was made governor of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magnesia_on_the_Maeander?lang=en'>Magnesia_on_the_Maeander</a>, and lived there for the rest of his life.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> died in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/459_BC?lang=en'>459_BC</a>, probably of natural causes. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>'s reputation was posthumously rehabilitated, and he was re-established as a hero of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> (and indeed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>) cause. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> can still reasonably be thought of as "the man most instrumental in achieving the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Salvation?lang=en'>Salvation</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>" from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> threat, as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> describes him. His naval policies would have a lasting impact on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> as well, since maritime power became the cornerstone of the Athenian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire?lang=en'>Roman_Empire</a> and golden age. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> assessed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> as "a man who exhibited the most indubitable signs of genius; indeed, in this particular he has a claim on our admiration quite extraordinary and unparalleled".[citation needed]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> was born in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deme?lang=en'>Deme</a> of Phrearrhioi around 524 BC,[3] the son of Neocles, who was, in the words of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> "no very conspicuous man".[4] His mother is more obscure; according to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a>, she was either a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrace?lang=en'>Thrace</a> woman called Abrotonon, or <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Euterpe?lang=en'>Euterpe</a>, a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carians?lang=en'>Carians</a> from Halicarnassus.[4] Like many contemporaries, little is known of his early years. Some authors report that he was unruly as a child and was consequently disowned by his father.[5][6] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> considers this to be false.[7] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> indicates that, on account of his mother's background, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> was considered something of an outsider; furthermore the family appear to have lived in an immigrant district of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cynosarges?lang=en'>Cynosarges</a>, outside the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> walls.[4] However, in an early example of his cunning, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> persuaded "well-born" children to exercise with him in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cynosarges?lang=en'>Cynosarges</a>, thus breaking down the distinction between "alien and legitimate".[4] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> further reports that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> was preoccupied, even as a child, with preparing for public life.[7] His teacher is said to have told him:[7]
<br>
<br>"My boy, you will be nothing insignificant, but definitely something great, either for good or evil."
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> left three sons by Archippe, daughter to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lysander?lang=en'>Lysander</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alopece?lang=en'>Alopece</a>,[8]—Archeptolis, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polyeuctus?lang=en'>Polyeuctus</a>, and Cleophantus. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato?lang=en'>Plato</a> the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosopher?lang=en'>Philosopher</a> mentions Cleophantus as a most excellent horseman, but otherwise insignificant person. And <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> had two sons older than these three, Neocles and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diocletian?lang=en'>Diocletian</a>. Neocles died when he was young by the bite of a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry?lang=en'>Cavalry</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diocletian?lang=en'>Diocletian</a> was adopted by his grandfather, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lysander?lang=en'>Lysander</a>. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> had many daughters, of whom Mnesiptolema, whom he had by a second marriage, was wife to Archeptolis, her brother by another mother, and became priestess of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cybele?lang=en'>Cybele</a>; Italia was married to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Panthoides?lang=en'>Panthoides</a>, of the island of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chios?lang=en'>Chios</a>; <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sybaris?lang=en'>Sybaris</a> to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicomedes_IV_of_Bithynia?lang=en'>Nicomedes_IV_of_Bithynia</a> the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>. After the death of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>, his nephew, Phrasicles, went to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magnesia_on_the_Maeander?lang=en'>Magnesia_on_the_Maeander</a>, and married, with her brothers' consent, another daughter, Nicomache, and took charge of her sister <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a>, the youngest of all ten children.
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> grew up in a period of upheaval in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tyrant?lang=en'>Tyrant</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peisistratos?lang=en'>Peisistratos</a> had died in 527 BC, passing power to his sons, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hipparchus?lang=en'>Hipparchus</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hippias?lang=en'>Hippias</a>.[9] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hipparchus?lang=en'>Hipparchus</a> was murdered in 514 BC, and in response to this, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hippias?lang=en'>Hippias</a> became paranoid and started to rely increasingly on foreign <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mercenary?lang=en'>Mercenary</a> to keep a hold on power.[10] The head of the powerful, but exiled (according to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> only—the fragmentary <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archon?lang=en'>Archon</a> List for 525/4 shows a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cleisthenes?lang=en'>Cleisthenes</a>, an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alcmaeonidae?lang=en'>Alcmaeonidae</a>, holding office in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> during this period) <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alcmaeonidae?lang=en'>Alcmaeonidae</a> family, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cleisthenes?lang=en'>Cleisthenes</a>, began to scheme to overthrow <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hippias?lang=en'>Hippias</a> and return to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>.[11] In 510 BC, he persuaded the Spartan king <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cleomenes_I?lang=en'>Cleomenes_I</a> to launch a full-scale attack on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, which succeeded in overthrowing <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hippias?lang=en'>Hippias</a>.[11] However, in the aftermath, the other noble ('<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eupatridae?lang=en'>Eupatridae</a>') families of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> rejected <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cleisthenes?lang=en'>Cleisthenes</a>, electing <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isagoras?lang=en'>Isagoras</a> as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archon?lang=en'>Archon</a>, with the support of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cleomenes_I?lang=en'>Cleomenes_I</a>.[11] On a personal level, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cleisthenes?lang=en'>Cleisthenes</a> wanted to return to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>; however, he also probably wanted to prevent <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> becoming a Spartan client state. Outmaneuvering the other nobles, he proposed to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> people a radical program in which political power would be invested in the people—a "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athenian_democracy?lang=en'>Athenian_democracy</a>".[11] The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> people thus overthrew <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isagoras?lang=en'>Isagoras</a>, repelled a Spartan attack under <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cleomenes_I?lang=en'>Cleomenes_I</a>, and invited <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cleisthenes?lang=en'>Cleisthenes</a> to return to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, to put his plan into action.[12] The establishment of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athenian_democracy?lang=en'>Athenian_democracy</a> was to radically change <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>:
<br>
<br>"And so it was that the Athenians found themselves suddenly a great power...they gave <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vivid_(band)?lang=en'>Vivid_(band)</a> proof of what equality and freedom of speech might achieve"[13]
<br>
<br>The new system of government in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> opened up a wealth of opportunity for men like <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>, who previously would have had no access to power.[14] Moreover, the new institutions of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athenian_democracy?lang=en'>Athenian_democracy</a> required skills that had previously been unimportant in government. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> was to prove himself a master of the new system; "he could infight, he could network, he could <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spin_bowling?lang=en'>Spin_bowling</a>... and crucially, he knew how to make himself visible."[14] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> moved to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kerameikos?lang=en'>Kerameikos</a>, a down-market part of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>. This move marked him out as a 'man of the people', and allowed him to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Interaction?lang=en'>Interaction</a> more easily with ordinary citizens. He began building up a support base among these newly empowered citizens:
<br>
<br>"he wooed the poor; and they, not used to being courted, duly loved him back. Touring the taverns, the markets, the docks, canvassing where no politician had thought to canvas before, making sure never to forget a single voter's name, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> had set his eyes on a radical new constituency"[14]
<br>
<br>However, he took care to ensure that he did not alienate the nobility of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>.[14] He began to practice law, the first person in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> to prepare for public life in this way.[14] His ability as attorney and arbitrator, used in the service of the common people, gained him further popularity.[15]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> probably turned 30 in 494 BC, which qualified him to become an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archon?lang=en'>Archon</a>, the highest of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_magistrate?lang=en'>Roman_magistrate</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>.[14] On the back of his popularity, he evidently decided to run for this office and was elected <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archon?lang=en'>Archon</a> Eponymous, the highest government office in the following year (493 BC).[14] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>'s archonship saw the beginnings of a major theme in his career; the advancement of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> sea-power. Under his guidance, the Athenians began the building of a new port at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piraeus?lang=en'>Piraeus</a>, to replace the existing facilities at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalerum?lang=en'>Phalerum</a>.[14] Although further away from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piraeus?lang=en'>Piraeus</a> offered three natural harbours, and could be easily fortified.[16] Since <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> was to become an essentially maritime power during the 5th century BC, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>'s policies were to have huge significance for the future of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, and indeed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>. In advancing naval power, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> was probably advocating a course of action he thought essential for the long-term prospects of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>.[14] However, as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> implies, since naval power relied on the mass mobilisation of the common citizens (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solonian_Constitution?lang=en'>Solonian_Constitution</a>) as rowers, such a policy put more power into the hands of average Athenians—and thus into <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>'s own hands.[16]
<br>
<br>After <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon?lang=en'>Battle_of_Marathon</a>, probably in 489, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a>, the hero of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a>, was seriously wounded in an abortive attempt to capture <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paros?lang=en'>Paros</a>. Taking advantage of his incapacitation, the powerful <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alcmaeonidae?lang=en'>Alcmaeonidae</a> family arranged for him to be prosecuted.[17] The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> aristocracy, and indeed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> aristocrats in general, were loath to see one person pre-eminent, and such maneuvers were commonplace.[17] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a> was given a massive fine for the crime of 'deceiving the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> people', but died weeks later as a result of his wound.[17] In the wake of this prosecution, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> people chose to use a new institution of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athenian_democracy?lang=en'>Athenian_democracy</a>, which had been part of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cleisthenes?lang=en'>Cleisthenes</a>'s reforms, but remained so far unused.[17] This was '<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ostracism?lang=en'>Ostracism</a>'—each <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> citizen was required to write on a shard of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greek_art?lang=en'>Ancient_Greek_art</a> (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ostracon?lang=en'>Ostracon</a>) the name of a politician that they wished to see exiled for a period of ten years.[17] This may have been triggered by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a>'s prosecution, and used by the Athenians to try and stop such power-games among the noble families.[17] Certainly, in the years (487 BC) following, the heads of the prominent families, including the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alcmaeonidae?lang=en'>Alcmaeonidae</a>, were exiled.[17] The career of a politician in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> thus became fraught with more difficulty, since displeasing the population was likely to result in exile.[17]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>, with his power-base firmly established among the poor, moved naturally to fill the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Power_vacuum?lang=en'>Power_vacuum</a> left by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a>'s death, and in that decade became the most influential politician in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>.[17] However, the support of the nobility began to coalesce around the man who would become <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>'s great rival—Aristides.[18] Aristides cast himself as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>'s opposite—virtuous, honest and incorruptible—and his followers called him "the just".[18] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> suggests that the rivalry between the two had begun when they competed over the love of a boy: "... they were rivals for the affection of the beautiful Stesilaus of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kea_(island)?lang=en'>Kea_(island)</a>, and were passionate beyond all moderation."[19]

<br>During the decade, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> continued to advocate the expansion of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> naval power.[17] The Athenians were certainly aware throughout this period that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> interest in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> had not ended; <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I?lang=en'>Darius_I</a>'s son and successor, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a>, had continued the preparations for the invasion of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>.[20] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> seems to have realised that for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> to survive the coming <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Onslaught_(comics)?lang=en'>Onslaught_(comics)</a> required a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hellenic_Navy?lang=en'>Hellenic_Navy</a> that could hope to face up to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> navy, and he therefore attempted to persuade the Athenians to build such a fleet.[14][17] Aristides, as champion of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zeugites?lang=en'>Zeugites</a> (the upper, 'hoplite-class') vigorously opposed such a policy.[18]
<br>
<br>In 483 BC, a massive new seam of silver was found in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> mines at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Laurium?lang=en'>Laurium</a>.[21] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> proposed that the silver should be used to build a new fleet of 200 triremes, while Aristides suggested it should instead be distributed among the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> citizens.[22] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> avoided mentioning <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>, deeming that it was too distant a threat for the Athenians to act on, and instead focused their attention on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegina?lang=en'>Aegina</a>.[21] At the time, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> was embroiled in a long-running war with the Aeginetans, and building a fleet would allow the Athenians to finally defeat them at sea.[21] As a result, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>'s motion was carried easily, although only 100 warships of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trireme?lang=en'>Trireme</a> type were to be built.[21] Aristides refused to countenance this; conversely <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> was not pleased that only 100 ships would be built.[22] Tension between the two camps built over the winter, so that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ostracism?lang=en'>Ostracism</a> of 482 BC became a direct contest between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> and Aristides.[22] In what has been characterized as the first <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Referendum?lang=en'>Referendum</a>, Aristides was ostracised, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>'s policies were endorsed.[22] Indeed, becoming aware of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> preparations for the coming invasion, the Athenians voted for the construction of more ships than <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> had initially asked for.[22] In the run up to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> invasion, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> had thus become the foremost politician in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>.[15]

<br>A Roman-era bust of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>, based on a 5th-century BC <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> original, in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Museo_Archeologico_Ostiense?lang=en'>Museo_Archeologico_Ostiense</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ostia_Antica?lang=en'>Ostia_Antica</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Republic?lang=en'>Roman_Republic</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Italy?lang=en'>Roman_Italy</a>
<br>In 481 BC, a congress of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> city-states was held, during which 30 or so[citation needed] states agreed to ally themselves against the forthcoming invasion.[23] The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> and Athenians were foremost in this alliance, being sworn enemies of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>.[24] The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> claimed the command of land forces, and since the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> (hereafter referred to as "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a>") fleet would be dominated by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> tried to claim command of the naval forces.[25] However, the other naval powers, including <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegina?lang=en'>Aegina</a> refused to give command to the Athenians, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> pragmatically backed down.[25] Instead, as a compromise, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> (an insignificant naval power), in the person of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eurybiades?lang=en'>Eurybiades</a> were to command the naval forces.[26] It is clear from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, however, that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> would be the real leader of the fleet.[27]
<br>
<br>The 'congress' met again in the spring of 480 BC. A <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thessaly?lang=en'>Thessaly</a> delegation suggested that the allies could muster in the narrow Vale of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vale_of_Tempe?lang=en'>Vale_of_Tempe</a>, on the borders of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thessaly?lang=en'>Thessaly</a>, and thereby block <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a>'s advance.[28] A force of 10,000 <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a> was dispatched under the command of the Spartan <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polemarch?lang=en'>Polemarch</a> Euenetus and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> to the Vale of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vale_of_Tempe?lang=en'>Vale_of_Tempe</a>, which they believed the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> army would have to pass through. However, once there, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great?lang=en'>Alexander_the_Great</a> I of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Macedonia?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Macedonia</a> warned them that the vale could be bypassed by several other passes, and that the army of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a> was overwhelmingly large, and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> retreated.[29] Shortly afterwards, they received the news that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a> had crossed the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dardanelles?lang=en'>Dardanelles</a>.[28]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> now developed a second strategy. The route to southern <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeotia?lang=en'>Boeotia</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attica?lang=en'>Attica</a> and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnese?lang=en'>Peloponnese</a>) would require the army of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a> to travel through the very narrow pass of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a>.[30] This could easily be blocked by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoplite?lang=en'>Hoplite</a>, despite the overwhelming numbers of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>; furthermore, to prevent the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> bypassing <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> by sea, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> and allied navies could block the straits of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Artemisium?lang=en'>Battle_of_Artemisium</a>.[30] However, after the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vale_of_Tempe?lang=en'>Vale_of_Tempe</a> debacle, it was uncertain whether the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> would be willing to march out from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnese?lang=en'>Peloponnese</a> again.[31] To persuade the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> to defend <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attica?lang=en'>Attica</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> had to show them that the Athenians were willing to do everything necessary for the success of the alliance. In short, the entire <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> fleet must be dispatched to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Artemisium?lang=en'>Battle_of_Artemisium</a>.
<br>
<br>To do this, every able-bodied <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> male would be required to man the ships. This in turn meant that the Athenians must prepare to abandon <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>.[31] Persuading the Athenians to take this course was undoubtedly one of the highlights of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>'s career.[32] As <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holland?lang=en'>Holland</a> has it:
<br>
<br>"What precise heights of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rhetoric?lang=en'>Rhetoric</a> he attained, what stirring and memorable phrases he pronounced, we have no way of knowing...only by the effect it had on the assembly can we gauge what surely must have been its electric and vivifying quality—for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>' <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Audacious-class_aircraft_carrier?lang=en'>Audacious-class_aircraft_carrier</a> proposals, when put to the vote, were ratified. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> people, facing the gravest moment of peril in their history, committed themselves once and for all to the alien element of the sea, and put their faith in a man whose ambitions many had long profoundly dreaded."[31]
<br>
<br>His proposals accepted, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> issued orders for the women and children of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> to be sent to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Troezen?lang=en'>Troezen</a>, safely inside the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnese?lang=en'>Peloponnese</a>.[33] He was then able to travel to a meeting of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a>, at which he proposed his strategy; with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> fleet <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Becky_Mode?lang=en'>Becky_Mode</a> to the defence of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>, the other <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a> accepted his proposals.[30]
<br>
<br>Thus, in August 480 BC, when the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> army was approaching <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thessaly?lang=en'>Thessaly</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a> fleet sailed to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Artemisium?lang=en'>Battle_of_Artemisium</a>, and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a> army marched to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a>.[34] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> himself took command of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> contingent of the fleet, and went to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Artemisium?lang=en'>Battle_of_Artemisium</a>. When the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> fleet finally arrived at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Artemisium?lang=en'>Battle_of_Artemisium</a> after a significant delay, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eurybiades?lang=en'>Eurybiades</a>, who both <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> suggest was not the most inspiring commander, wished to sail away without fighting.[27][35] At this point <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> accepted a large bribe from the local people for the fleet to remain at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Artemisium?lang=en'>Battle_of_Artemisium</a>, and used some of it to bribe <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eurybiades?lang=en'>Eurybiades</a> to remain, while <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Body_piercing?lang=en'>Body_piercing</a> the rest.[36] From this point on, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> appears to have been more-or-less in charge of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a> effort at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Artemisium?lang=en'>Battle_of_Artemisium</a>.[35] Over three days of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a> held their own against the much larger <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> fleet, but sustained significant losses.[37] However, the loss of the simultaneous Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a> to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> made their continued presence at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Artemisium?lang=en'>Battle_of_Artemisium</a> irrelevant, and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a> thus evacuated.[38] According to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> left messages at every place where the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> fleet might stop for drinking water, asking the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionians?lang=en'>Ionians</a> in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> fleet to defect, or at least fight badly.[39] Even if this did not work, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> apparently intended that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a> would at least begin to suspect the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionians?lang=en'>Ionians</a>, thereby sowing dissension in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> ranks.[39]
<br>
<br>In the aftermath of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thermopylae?lang=en'>Thermopylae</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeotia?lang=en'>Boeotia</a> fell to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>, who then began to advance on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>.[40] The Peloponnesian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a> prepared to now defend the Isthmus of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a>, thus abandoning <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>.[41] From <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Artemisium?lang=en'>Battle_of_Artemisium</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a> fleet sailed to the island of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Battle_of_Salamis</a>, where the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> ships helped with the final evacuation of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>. The Peloponnesian contingents wanted to sail to the coast of the Isthmus to concentrate forces with the army.[42] However, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> tried to convince them to remain in the Straits of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Battle_of_Salamis</a>, invoking the lessons of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Artemisium?lang=en'>Battle_of_Artemisium</a>; "<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a> in close conditions works to our advantage".[42] After threatening to sail with the whole <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> people into exile in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily?lang=en'>Sicily</a>, he eventually persuaded the other <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a>, whose security after all relied on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> navy, to accept his plan.[43] Therefore, even after <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> had fallen to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>, and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> navy had arrived off the coast of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Battle_of_Salamis</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a> navy remained in the Straits. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> appears to have been aiming to fight a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a> that would cripple the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> navy, and thus guarantee the security of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnese?lang=en'>Peloponnese</a>.[42]
<br>
<br>To bring about this <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> used a cunning mix of subterfuge and misinformation, psychologically exploiting <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a>'s desire to finish the invasion.[44] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a>'s actions indicate that he was keen to finish the conquest of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> in 480 BC, and to do this, he needed a decisive victory over the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a> fleet.[45] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> sent a servant, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicinnus?lang=en'>Sicinnus</a>, to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a>, with a message proclaiming that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> was "on king's side and prefers that your affairs prevail, not the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>".[46] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> claimed that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a> commanders were infighting, that the Peloponnesians were planning to evacuate that very night, and that to gain victory all the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> needed to do was to block the straits.[46] In performing this subterfuge, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> seems to have been trying to lure the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> fleet into the Straits.[44] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Message_(Grandmaster_Flash_and_the_Furious_Five_song)?lang=en'>The_Message_(Grandmaster_Flash_and_the_Furious_Five_song)</a> also had a secondary purpose, namely that in the event of an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a> defeat, the Athenians would probably receive some degree of mercy from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a> (having indicated their readiness to submit).[44] At any rate, this was exactly the kind of news that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a> wanted to hear.[44] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a> evidently took the bait, and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> fleet was sent out to effect the block.[47] Perhaps overconfident and expecting no resistance, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> navy sailed into the Straits,[48] only to find that, far from disintegrating, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a> navy was ready for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a>.[49]
<br>
<br>According to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a>, after the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> navy began its maneuvers, Aristides arrived at the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a> camp from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegina?lang=en'>Aegina</a>.[50] Aristides had been recalled from exile along with the other ostracised Athenians on the order of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>, so that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> might be united against the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>.[50] Aristides told <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> fleet had encircled the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a>, which greatly pleased <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>, as he now knew that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> had walked into his trap.[51] The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a> commanders seem to have taken this news rather uncomplainingly, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holland?lang=en'>Holland</a> therefore suggests that they were party to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>'s ruse all along.[52] Either way, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a> prepared for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> delivered a speech to the marines before they embarked on the ships.[53] In the ensuing <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a>, the cramped conditions in the Straits hindered the much larger <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> navy, which became disarrayed, and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a> took advantage to win a famous victory.[54]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Battle_of_Salamis</a> was the turning point in the second <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> invasion, and indeed the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greco-Persian_Wars?lang=en'>Greco-Persian_Wars</a> in general.[55] While the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle?lang=en'>Battle</a> did not end the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> invasion, it effectively ensured that all <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> would not be conquered, and allowed the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a> to go on the offensive in 479 BC. A number of historians believe that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Battle_of_Salamis</a> is one of the most significant battles in human history.[56][57][58] Since <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>' long-standing advocacy of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> naval power enabled the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a> fleet to fight, and his stratagem brought about the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Battle_of_Salamis</a>, it is probably not an exaggeration to say, as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> does, that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>, "...is thought to have been the man most instrumental in achieving the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Salvation?lang=en'>Salvation</a> of Hellas."[21][35]
<br>
<br>The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a> victory at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Battle_of_Salamis</a> ended the immediate threat to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a> now returned to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a> with part of the army, leaving his general <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mardonius?lang=en'>Mardonius</a> to attempt to complete the conquest.[59] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mardonius?lang=en'>Mardonius</a> wintered in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeotia?lang=en'>Boeotia</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thessaly?lang=en'>Thessaly</a>, and the Athenians were thus able to return to their <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a>, which had been burnt and razed by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>, for the winter.[60] For the Athenians, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> personally, the winter would be a testing one. The Peloponnesians refused to countenance marching north of the Isthmus to fight the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> army; the Athenians tried to shame them into doing so, with no success.[61]
<br>
<br>During the winter, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a> held a meeting at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth?lang=en'>Corinth</a> to celebrate their success, and award prizes for achievement.[62] However, perhaps tired of the Athenians pointing out their role at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis?lang=en'>Battle_of_Salamis</a>, and of their demands for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a> to march north, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a> awarded the prize for civic achievement to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegina?lang=en'>Aegina</a>.[61][63] Furthermore, although the admirals all voted for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> in second place, they all voted for themselves in first place, so that no-one won the prize for individual achievement. In response, realising the importance of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> fleet to their security, and probably seeking to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Massage?lang=en'>Massage</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>'s ego, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> brought <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>.[61][63] There, he was awarded a special prize "for his wisdom and cleverness", and won high praise from all.[63][64] Furthermore, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> reports that at the next <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Olympic_Games?lang=en'>Ancient_Olympic_Games</a>:
<br>
<br>"[when] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> entered the stadium, the audience neglected the contestants all day long to gaze on him, and pointed him out with admiring applause to visiting strangers, so that he too was delighted, and confessed to his friends that he was now reaping in full measure the harvest of his toils in behalf of Hellas."[63]
<br>
<br>After returning to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> in the winter, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> reports that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> made a proposal to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> while the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> fleet was wintering at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pagasae?lang=en'>Pagasae</a>:
<br>
<br>"<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> once declared to the people [of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>] that he had devised a certain measure which could not be revealed to them, though it would be helpful and salutary for the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a>, and they ordered that Aristides alone should hear what it was and pass judgment on it. So <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> told Aristides that his purpose was to burn the naval station of the confederate <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>, for that in this way the Athenians would be greatest, and lords of all. Then Aristides came before the people and said of the deed which <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> purposed to do, that none other could be more <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Advantageous?lang=en'>Advantageous</a>, and none more unjust. On hearing this, the Athenians <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bishop?lang=en'>Bishop</a> that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> cease from his purpose."[65][66]
<br>
<br>However, as happened to many prominent individuals in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athenian_democracy?lang=en'>Athenian_democracy</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>'s fellow citizens grew jealous of his success, and possibly tired of his boasting.[61][67] It is probable that in early 479 BC, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> was stripped of his command; instead, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xanthippus?lang=en'>Xanthippus</a> was to command the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> fleet, and Aristides the land forces.[61][68] Though <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> was no doubt politically and militarily active for the rest of the campaign, no mention of his activities in 479 BC is made in the ancient sources.[69] In the summer of that year, after receiving an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> ultimatum, the Peloponnesians finally agreed to assemble an army and march to confront <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mardonius?lang=en'>Mardonius</a>, who had reoccupied <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> in June.[70] At the decisive Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plataea?lang=en'>Plataea</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a> destroyed the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> army, while apparently on the same day, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a> navy destroyed the remnants of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> fleet at the Battle of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Mycale?lang=en'>Battle_of_Mycale</a>.[71] These twin victories completed the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a> triumph, and ended the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> threat to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>.[71]
<br>
<br>Whatever the cause of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>'s unpopularity in 479 BC, it obviously did not last long. Both Diodorus and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> suggest he was quickly restored to the favour of the Athenians.[16][72] Indeed, after 479 BC, he seems to have enjoyed a relatively long period of popularity.[73]
<br>
<br>In the aftermath of the invasion, the Athenians began rebuilding their <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> under the guidance of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>.[16] They wished to restore the fortifications of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, but the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> objected on the grounds that no place north of the Isthmus should be left that the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> could use as a fortress.[72] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> urged the citizens to build the fortifications as quickly as possible, then went to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> as an ambassador to answer the charges levelled by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a>. There, he assured them that no building work was on-going, and urged them to send emissaries to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> to see for themselves.[74] By the time the ambassadors arrived, the Athenians had finished building, and then detained the Spartan ambassadors when they complained about the presence of the fortifications.[74] By delaying in this manner, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> gave the Athenians enough time to fortify the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a>, and thus ward off any Spartan attack aimed at preventing the re-fortification of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>.[74] Furthermore, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> were obliged to repatriate <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> in order to free their own ambassadors.[16][74] However, this episode may be seen as the beginning of the Spartan mistrust of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>, which would return to haunt him.[16]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> also now returned to his naval policy,[16] and more ambitious undertakings that would increase the dominant position of his native state.[75] He further extended and fortified the port complex at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piraeus?lang=en'>Piraeus</a>, and "fastened the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> [<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>] to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piraeus?lang=en'>Piraeus</a>, and the land to the sea".[16] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> probably aimed to make <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> the dominant naval power in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegean_Sea?lang=en'>Aegean_Sea</a>.[75] Indeed, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> would create the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Delian_League</a> in 478 BC, uniting the naval power of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegean_Islands?lang=en'>Aegean_Islands</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a> under <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> leadership.[76] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> introduced tax breaks for merchants and artisans, to attract both people and trade to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> to make <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> a great mercantile centre.[77] He also instructed the Athenians to build 20 triremes per year, to ensure that their dominance in naval matters continued.[77] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> reports that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> also secretly proposed to destroy the beached ships of the other <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allies_of_World_War_I?lang=en'>Allies_of_World_War_I</a> navies to ensure complete naval dominance—but was <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Objection_(law)?lang=en'>Objection_(law)</a> by Aristides and the council of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>.[78]
<br>
<br>It seems clear that, towards the end of the decade, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> had begun to accrue enemies, and had become arrogant; moreover his fellow citizens had become jealous of his prestige and power.[16][67] The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rhodes?lang=en'>Rhodes</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poetry?lang=en'>Poetry</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Timocreon?lang=en'>Timocreon</a> was among his most eloquent enemies, composing slanderous drinking songs.[79] Meanwhile, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> actively worked against him, trying to promote <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cimon?lang=en'>Cimon</a> (son of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miltiades?lang=en'>Miltiades</a>) as a rival to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>. Furthermore, after the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treason?lang=en'>Treason</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Disgrace?lang=en'>Disgrace</a> of the Spartan general <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pausanias_of_Sparta?lang=en'>Pausanias_of_Sparta</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> tried to implicate <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> in the plot; he was, however, acquitted of these charges.[73] In <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> itself, he lost favour by building a sanctuary of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artemis?lang=en'>Artemis</a>, with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epithet?lang=en'>Epithet</a> Aristoboulẽ ("of good counsel") near his home, a blatant reference to his own role in delivering <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> invasion.[67] Eventually, in either 472 or 471 BC, he was ostracised.[67][80] In itself, this did not mean that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> had done anything wrong; <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ostracism?lang=en'>Ostracism</a>, in the words of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a>,
<br>
<br>"was not a penalty, but a way of pacifying and alleviating that jealousy which delights to humble the eminent, breathing out its malice into this <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Disfranchisement?lang=en'>Disfranchisement</a>."
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> first went to live in exile in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Argos?lang=en'>Argos</a>.[80][81] However, perceiving that they now had a prime opportunity to bring <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> down for good, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> again levelled accusations of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>'s complicity in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pausanias_of_Sparta?lang=en'>Pausanias_of_Sparta</a>'s <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treason?lang=en'>Treason</a>.[80] They demanded that he be tried by the '<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Congress?lang=en'>United_States_Congress</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>', rather than in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, although it seems that in the end he was actually summoned to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> to stand trial.[80][81] Perhaps realising he had little hope of surviving this trial, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> fled, first to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corfu?lang=en'>Corfu</a>, and thence to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Admetus_of_Epirus?lang=en'>Admetus_of_Epirus</a>, king of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Molossians?lang=en'>Molossians</a>.[82][83] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>'s flight probably only served to convince his accusers of his guilt, and he was declared a traitor in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, his property to be confiscated.[84] It should be noted that both Diodorus and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> considered that the charges were false, and made solely for the purposes of destroying <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>.[80][81] The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a> sent ambassadors to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Admetus_of_Epirus?lang=en'>Admetus_of_Epirus</a>, threatening that the whole of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> would go to war with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Molossians?lang=en'>Molossians</a> unless they surrendered <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>.[83] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Admetus_of_Epirus?lang=en'>Admetus_of_Epirus</a>, however, allowed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> to escape, giving him a large sum of gold to aid him on his way.[83] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> then fled from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>, apparently never to return, thus effectively bringing his political career to an end.[83][85]

<br>From <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Molossians?lang=en'>Molossians</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> apparently fled to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pydna?lang=en'>Pydna</a>, from where he took a ship for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a>.[84][85] This ship was blown off course by a storm, and ended up at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naxos?lang=en'>Naxos</a>, which an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> fleet was in the process of besieging.[84][85] Desperate to avoid identification, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> pestered the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain?lang=en'>Sea_captain</a> of the ship to continue the journey immediately.[84][85] According to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>, who wrote within living <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memory?lang=en'>Memory</a> of the events, the ship eventually landed safely at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephesus?lang=en'>Ephesus</a>, where <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> disembarked.[85] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> has the ship docking at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cumae?lang=en'>Cumae</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thessaly?lang=en'>Thessaly</a>,[86] and Diodorus has <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> making his way to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a> in an undefined manner.[83] Diodorus and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> next recount a similar tale, namely that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> stayed briefly with an acquaintance (Lysitheides or Nicogenes) who was also acquainted with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> king, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia?lang=en'>Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia</a>.[83][86] Since there was a bounty on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>'s head, this acquaintance devised a plan to safely convey <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> king in the type of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Covered_wagon?lang=en'>Covered_wagon</a> that the King's concubines travelled in.[83][86] All three chroniclers agree that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>'s next move was to contact the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> king; in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>, this is by letter,[85] while <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> and Diodorus have a face-to-face meeting with the king.[83][86] The spirit is, however, the same in all three: <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> introduces himself to the king and seeks to enter his service:[85][87]
<br>
<br>"I, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>, am come to you, who did your house more harm than any of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>, when I was compelled to defend myself against your father's invasion—harm, however, far surpassed by the good that I did him during his retreat, which brought no danger for me but much for him." (<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>)
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> say that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> asked for a year's grace to learn the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persian_language?lang=en'>Persian_language</a> and customs, after which he would serve the king, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia?lang=en'>Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia</a> granted this.[85][88] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> reports that, as might be imagined, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia?lang=en'>Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia</a> was elated that such a dangerous and illustrious foe had come to serve him.<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Effects_of_Hurricane_Sandy_in_New_York?lang=en'>Effects_of_Hurricane_Sandy_in_New_York</a>]
<br>
<br>At some point in his travels, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>'s wife and children were extricated from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> by a friend, and joined him in exile.[82] His friends also managed to send him many of his belongings, although up to 100 talents worth of his goods were confiscated by the Athenians.[84] When, after a year, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> returned to the king's court, he appears to have made an immediate impact, and "he attained...very high consideration there, such as no Hellene has ever possessed before or since".[90] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> recounts that "honors he enjoyed were far beyond those paid to other foreigners; nay, he actually took part in the King's hunts and in his household diversions".[88] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> advised the king on his dealings with the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>, although it seems that for a long period, the king was distracted by events elsewhere in the empire, and thus <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> "lived on for a long time without concern".[90][91] He was made governor of the district of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magnesia_on_the_Maeander?lang=en'>Magnesia_on_the_Maeander</a> on the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Büyük_Menderes_River?lang=en'>Büyük_Menderes_River</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a>, and assigned the revenues of three cities: <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magnesia_on_the_Maeander?lang=en'>Magnesia_on_the_Maeander</a> (about 50 talents per year—"for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sacramental_bread?lang=en'>Sacramental_bread</a>"); <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Myus?lang=en'>Myus</a> ("for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opson?lang=en'>Opson</a>"); and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lampsacus?lang=en'>Lampsacus</a> ("for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wine?lang=en'>Wine</a>").[88][90][92] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neanthes_of_Cyzicus?lang=en'>Neanthes_of_Cyzicus</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyzicus?lang=en'>Cyzicus</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phaenias_of_Eresus?lang=en'>Phaenias_of_Eresus</a> add two more, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Skepsis?lang=en'>Skepsis</a> ("for clothes") and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Percote?lang=en'>Percote</a> with bedding and furniture for his house.[citation needed]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> died at <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magnesia_on_the_Maeander?lang=en'>Magnesia_on_the_Maeander</a> in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/459_BC?lang=en'>459_BC</a>, at the age of 65, according to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a>, from natural causes.[90] However, perhaps inevitably, there were also rumours surrounding his death; that finding that he could not keep the promises that he had made to the king, he committed <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suicide?lang=en'>Suicide</a> by taking <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poison?lang=en'>Poison</a>, or drinking bull's <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blood?lang=en'>Blood</a>.[90][91][93] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> provides the most evocative version of this story:
<br>
<br>"But when <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ptolemaic_Kingdom?lang=en'>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</a> revolted with <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> aid...and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cimon?lang=en'>Cimon</a>'s mastery of the sea forced the King to resist the efforts of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> and to hinder their hostile growth...messages came down to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> saying that the King commanded him to make good his promises by applying himself to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> problem; then, neither embittered by anything like anger against his former fellow-citizens, nor lifted up by the great honor and power he was to have in the war, but possibly thinking his task not even approachable, both because Hellas had other great generals at the time, and especially because <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cimon?lang=en'>Cimon</a> was so marvelously successful in his campaigns; yet most of all out of regard for the reputation of his own achievements and the trophies of those early days; having decided that his best course was to put a fitting end to his life, he made a sacrifice to the gods, then called his friends together, gave them a farewell clasp of his hand, and, as the current story goes, drank bull's <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blood?lang=en'>Blood</a>, or as some say, took a quick <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poison?lang=en'>Poison</a>, and so died in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magnesia_on_the_Maeander?lang=en'>Magnesia_on_the_Maeander</a>, in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/65th_United_States_Congress?lang=en'>65th_United_States_Congress</a> year of his life...They say that the King, on learning the cause and the manner of his death, admired the man yet more, and continued to treat his friends and kindred with kindness."[91]
<br>
<br>It was rumored that after his death, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>'s bones were transported to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attica?lang=en'>Attica</a> in accordance with his wishes, and buried in his native soil in secret, it being illegal to bury an <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> traitor in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attica?lang=en'>Attica</a>.[90] The Magnesians built a "splendid tomb" in their market place for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>, which still stood during the time of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a>, and continued to dedicate part of their revenues to the family of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>.[94] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> indicates that he met in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> a <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_lineal_boxing_world_champions?lang=en'>List_of_lineal_boxing_world_champions</a> descendant of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> (also called <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>) who was still being paid these revenues, 600 years after the events in question.[94]
<br>
<br>It is possible to draw some conclusions about <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>'s character. Perhaps his most evident trait was his massive ambition; "In his ambition he surpassed all men";[15] "he hankered after public office rather as a man in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delirium?lang=en'>Delirium</a> might crave a cure".[14] He was proud and vain,[25] and anxious for recognition of his deeds.[95] His relationship with power was of a particularly personal nature; while he undoubtedly desired the best for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, many of his actions also seem to have been made in self-interest.[14] He also appears to have been corrupt (at least by modern standards), and was known for his fondness of bribes.[18]
<br>
<br>Yet, set against these negative traits, was an apparently natural brilliance and talent for leadership:[14]
<br>
<br>"<a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> was a man who exhibited the most indubitable signs of genius; indeed, in this particular he has a claim on our admiration quite extraordinary and unparalleled. By his own <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Native_capacity?lang=en'>Native_capacity</a>, alike unformed and unsupplemented by study, he was at once the best judge in those sudden crises which admit of little or of no deliberation, and the best <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Muhammad?lang=en'>Muhammad</a> of the future, even to its most distant possibilities. An able theoretical expositor of all that came within the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Celestial_spheres?lang=en'>Celestial_spheres</a> of his practice, he was not without the power of passing an adequate judgment in matters in which he had no experience. He could also excellently divine the good and evil which lay hid in the unseen future. In fine, whether we consider the extent of his natural powers, or the slightness of his application, this extraordinary man must be allowed to have surpassed all others in the faculty of intuitively meeting an emergency."[90]
<br>Both <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato?lang=en'>Plato</a> record variations of an anecdote in which <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> responded with subtle sarcasm to an undistinguished man who complained that the great politician owed his fame merely to the fact that he came from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>. As <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> tells it:
<br>
<br>"Timodemus of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Afidnes?lang=en'>Afidnes</a>, who was one of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>' enemies but not a man of note, was crazed with envy and spoke bitterly to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> of his visit to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>, saying that the honors he had from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> were paid him for <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>' sake and not for his own. This he kept saying until <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> replied, 'This is the truth of the matter: if I had been a man of Belbina I would not have been honored in this way by the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a>, nor would you, sir, for all you are a man of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>.' Such was the end of that business."[96]
<br>As <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato?lang=en'>Plato</a> tells it, the heckler hails from the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Small_Island_(TV_film)?lang=en'>Small_Island_(TV_film)</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Serifos?lang=en'>Serifos</a>; <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> retorts that it is true that he would not have been famous if he had come from that <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Small_Island_(TV_film)?lang=en'>Small_Island_(TV_film)</a>, but that the heckler would not have been famous either if he had been born in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>.[97]
<br>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> was undoubtedly intelligent, but also possessed natural cunning; "the workings of his mind [were] infinitely mobile and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Snake?lang=en'>Snake</a>".[14] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> was evidently sociable and appears to have enjoyed strong personal loyalty from his friends.[14][82] At any rate, it seems to have been <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>'s particular mix of virtues and vices that made him such an effective politician.[14]
<br>
<br>Ruins of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistoclean_Wall?lang=en'>Themistoclean_Wall</a> in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kerameikos?lang=en'>Kerameikos</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a>, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>, named after <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>
<br><a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> died with his reputation in tatters, a traitor to the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> people; the "saviour of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>" had turned into the enemy of liberty.[98] However, his reputation in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> was rehabilitated by <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pericles?lang=en'>Pericles</a> in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/450s_BC?lang=en'>450s_BC</a>, and by the time <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus?lang=en'>Herodotus</a> wrote his history, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> was once again seen as a hero.[99] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides?lang=en'>Thucydides</a> evidently held <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> in some esteem, and is uncharacteristically flattering in his praise for him (see above).[90] Diodorus also extensively praises <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>, going as far as to offer a rationale for the length at which he discusses him: "Now on the subject of the high merits of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>, even if we have dwelt over-long on the subject in this digression, we believed it not seemly that we should leave his great ability unrecorded."[100] Indeed, Diodorus goes so far as to say that
<br>
<br>"But if any man, putting envy aside, will estimate closely not only the man's natural gifts but also his achievements, he will find that on both counts <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> holds first place among all of whom we have record. Therefore one may well be <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amazed?lang=en'>Amazed</a> that the Athenians were willing to rid themselves of a man of such genius."[93]
<br>
<br>Since Diodorus's history includes such luminaries as <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great?lang=en'>Alexander_the_Great</a> I the Great and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hannibal?lang=en'>Hannibal</a>, this is high praise indeed. <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch?lang=en'>Plutarch</a> offers a more nuanced view of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>, with more of a critique of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>'s character. He does not detract from <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>'s achievements, but also highlights his failings.[19]
<br>
<br>Undoubtedly the greatest achievement of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>'s career was his role in the defeat of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a>'s invasion of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>. Against overwhelming odds, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> survived, and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_antiquity?lang=en'>Classical_antiquity</a> <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>, so influential in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Western_world?lang=en'>Western_world</a>, was able to develop unabated.[101] Moreover, <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>'s doctrine of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> naval power, and the establishment of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> as a major power in the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> world were of enormous consequence during the 5th century BC. In 478 BC, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> alliance was reconstituted without the Peloponnesian states, into the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Delian_League</a>, in which <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> was the dominant power.[102] This was essentially a maritime alliance of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> and her colonies, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegean_Sea?lang=en'>Aegean_Sea</a>, and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ionia?lang=en'>Ionia</a> cities. The <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Delian_League</a> took the war to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a>, eventually invading <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire?lang=en'>Achaemenid_Empire</a> territory and dominating the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegean_Sea?lang=en'>Aegean_Sea</a>.[102] Under the guidance of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pericles?lang=en'>Pericles</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delian_League?lang=en'>Delian_League</a> gradually evolved into the Athenian <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire?lang=en'>Roman_Empire</a>, the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zenith?lang=en'>Zenith</a> of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> power and influence.[103] <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a> seems to have deliberately set <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> up as a rival to <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> in the aftermath of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I?lang=en'>Xerxes_I</a>'s invasion, basing this strategy on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> naval power (contrasted with the power of the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spartan_army?lang=en'>Spartan_army</a>).[16] Tension grew throughout the century between <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_Athens?lang=en'>Classical_Athens</a> and <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a>, as they competed to be the leading state in <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a>.[104] Finally, in 431 BC, this tension erupted into the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesian_War?lang=en'>Peloponnesian_War</a>, the first of a series of conflicts that tore <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> apart for the next century; an unforeseen, if indirect, legacy of <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>'s.[104]

<br>Diodorus provides a rhetorical summary that reflects on <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themistocles?lang=en'>Themistocles</a>'s achievements:
<br>
<br>"What other man, while <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> still had the superior strength and the Spartan <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eurybiades?lang=en'>Eurybiades</a> held the supreme command of the fleet, could by his <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Single-handed_sailing?lang=en'>Single-handed_sailing</a> efforts have deprived <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta?lang=en'>Sparta</a> of that glory? Of what other man have we learned from history that by a single act he caused himself to surpass all the commanders, his <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a> all the other <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> states, and the <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece?lang=en'>Ancient_Greece</a> the barbarians? In whose term as general have the resources been more inferior and the dangers they faced greater? Who, facing the united might of all <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia?lang=en'>Anatolia</a>, has found himself at the side of his <a href='http://dbpedia.org/resource/City?lang=en'>City</a>
