The Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span> (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ancient Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>: Μάχη τῆς Μυκάλης; Machē tēs Mykalēs) was one of the two major battles that ended the second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> during the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>. It took place on or about August 27, 479 BC on the slopes of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mount Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mycale</b></span>, on the coast of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>, opposite the island of <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> was fought between an alliance of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states, including <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span>, and the Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The previous year, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion force, led by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> himself, had scored victories at the battles of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span>, and conquered <span style='color: blue'><b>Thessaly</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>; however, at the ensuing Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>, the allied <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> navies had won an unlikely victory, and therefore prevented the conquest of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> then retreated, leaving his general <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> with a substantial army to finish off the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> the following year.
<br>
<br>In the summer of 479 BC, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> assembled a huge army (by contemporary standards), and marched to confront <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> at the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>. At the same time, the allied fleet sailed to <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span>, where the demoralised remnants of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> navy were based. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span>, seeking to avoid a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, beached their fleet below the slopes of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>, and, with the support of a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>army group</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Army_group</b></span>, built a palisaded camp. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> commander <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leotychides</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leotychidas</b></span> decided to attack the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> anyway, landing the fleet's complement of marines to do so.
<br>
<br>Although the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> forces put up <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>stout</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Stout</b></span> resistance, the heavily armoured <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> again proved themselves superior in combat, and eventually routed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> troops, who fled to their camp. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> contingents in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army defected, and the camp was assailed and a large number of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> slaughtered. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> ships were then captured and burned. The complete destruction of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> navy, along with the destruction of <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>'s army at <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> (allegedly on the same day as the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>), decisively ended the invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. After <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>, the allied <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> would take the offensive against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, marking a new phase of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>. Although <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span> was in every sense a decisive victory, it does not seem to have been attributed the same significance (even at the time) as, for example the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> victory at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> or even the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> defeat at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span>.

<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>main source</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Main_Source</b></span> for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> is the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, who has been called the 'Father of History',[3] was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> (then under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> overlordship). He wrote his 'Enquiries' (Greek—Historia; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>English</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kingdom_of_England</b></span>—(The) <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span>) around 440–430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ending in 450 BC).[4] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented 'history' as we know it.[4] As <span style='color: blue'><b>Holland</b></span> has it: "For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>manifest destiny</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Manifest_destiny</b></span>, but rather explanations he could verify personally."[4]
<br>
<br>Some subsequent ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, starting with <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>.[5][6] Nevertheless, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> chose to begin his history where <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> left off (at the Siege of Sestos), and therefore evidently felt that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting.[6] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> criticised <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> in his essay "On The Malignity of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>", describing <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> as "Philobarbaros" (barbarian-lover), for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed.[7] A negative view of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> was passed on to <span style='color: blue'><b>Renaissance</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>, though he remained well read.[8] However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaeological finds which have repeatedly confirmed his version of events.[9] The prevailing modern view is that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> generally did a remarkable job in his Historia, but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>skepticism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Skepticism</b></span>.[9] Nevertheless, there are still some historians who believe <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> made up much of his story.[10]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Sicilian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Sicilian</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Diodorus Siculus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Diodorus_Siculus</b></span>, writing in the 1st century BC in his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bibliotheca Historica</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bibliotheca_historica</b></span>, also provides an account of the Battle of Mykale, derived directly from the earlier <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephorus</b></span>. This account is fairly consistent with <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s.[11] Archaeological evidence, such as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Serpent Column</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Serpent_Column</b></span>, also supports some of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s specific claims.[12]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> had supported the unsuccessful <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> against the Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> in 499-494 BC. The Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> was still relatively young, and prone to revolts amongst its subject peoples.[13][14] Moreover, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> was a usurper, and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule.[13] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> threatened the integrity of his empire, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> thus vowed to punish those involved (especially those not already part of the empire).[15][16] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> also saw the opportunity to expand his empire into the fractious world of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ancient Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[16] A preliminary expedition under <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>, in 492 BC, to secure the land approaches to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> ended with the re-conquest of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span> and forced <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span> to become a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>client kingdom</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Client_state</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[17] An amphibious task force was then sent out under Datis and <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> in 490 BC, successfully sacking <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>,[18] before moving to attack <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>. However, at the ensuing Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, the Athenians won a remarkable victory, which resulted in the withdrawal of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>.[19]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> therefore began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. However, he died before the invasion could begin.[20] The throne of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> passed to his son <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>, who quickly resumed the preparations for the invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, including building two pontoon bridges across the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span>.[21] In 481 BC, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> sent ambassadors around <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> asking for earth and water as a gesture of their submission, but making the very deliberate omission of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> (both of whom were at open war with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>).[22] Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states. A congress of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> states met at <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>late autumn</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Late_Autumn_(1960_film)</b></span> of 481 BC, and a confederate alliance of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states was formed (hereafter referred to as 'the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span>').[23] This was remarkable for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>disjointed</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Disjointed</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> world, especially since many of the city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.[24]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> initially adopted a strategy of blocking the land and sea approaches to southern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[25] Thus, in August 480 BC, after hearing of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>'s approach, a small <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> army led by the Spartan king <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> blocked the Pass of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span>, whilst an Athenian-dominated navy sailed to the Straits of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span>. Famously, the vastly outnumbered <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army held <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span> against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army for six days in total, before being outflanked by a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mountain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mountain_warfare</b></span> path. Although much of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army retreated, the rearguard, formed of the Spartan and Thespian contingents, was surrounded and annihilated.[26] The simultaneous Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span>, consisting of a series of naval encounters, was up to that point a stalemate;[27] however, when news of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span> reached them, they also retreated, since holding the straits of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span> was now a moot point.[28]
<br>
<br>Following <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army had proceeded to burn and sack the Boeotian cities which had not surrendered, <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Thespiae</b></span>, before taking possession of the now-evacuated <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>. The allied army, meanwhile, prepared to defend the Isthmus of <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span>.[29] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> wished for a final crushing defeat of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> to finish the conquest of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> in that campaigning season; conversely the allies sought a decisive victory over the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> navy that would guarantee the security of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>.[30] The ensuing naval Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> ended in a decisive victory for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span>, marking a turning point in the conflict.[31]
<br>
<br>Following the defeat of his navy at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> retreated to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> with, according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> at least, the majority of the army. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> suggests that this was because he feared the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> would sail to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> and destroy the pontoon bridges, thereby trapping his army in <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>.[32] He thus left <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>, with handpicked troops, to complete the conquest of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> the following year.[33] <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> evacuated <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>, and wintered in <span style='color: blue'><b>Thessaly</b></span>;[34] the Athenians then reoccupied their destroyed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>.[31] Over the winter, there seems to have been some tension among the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span>. In particular, the Athenians, who were not protected by the Isthmus, but whose fleet were the key to the security of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>, felt hard done by, and demanded an allied army march north the following year.[31] When the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> failed to commit to this, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> fleet refused to join the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> navy in spring. The navy, now under the command of the Spartan king <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leotychides</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leotychidas</b></span>, thus skulked off <span style='color: blue'><b>Delos</b></span>, whilst the remnants of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet skulked off <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span>, both sides unwilling to risk <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>.[35] Similarly, <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> remained in <span style='color: blue'><b>Thessaly</b></span>, knowing an attack on the Isthmus was pointless, whilst the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> refused to send an army outside the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>.[31]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> moved to break the stalemate by trying to win over the Athenians and their fleet through the mediation of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> I of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span>, offering peace, self-government and territorial expansion.[35] The Athenians made sure that a Spartan delegation was also on hand to hear the offer, and rejected it:
<br>
<br>The degree to which we are put in the shadow by the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>' strength is hardly something you need to bring to our attention. We are already well aware of it. But even so, such is our love of liberty, that we will never surrender.[35]
<br>
<br>Upon this refusal, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> marched south again. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> was again evacuated and left to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> now repeated his offer of peace to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> refugees on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, along with <span style='color: blue'><b>Megara</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>, sent emissaries to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> demanding assistance, and threatening to accept the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> terms if not.[36] According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, who were at that time celebrating the festival of Hyacinthus, delayed making a decision until they were persuaded by a guest, Chileos of <span style='color: blue'><b>Tegea</b></span>, who pointed out the danger to all of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> if the Athenians surrendered.[37] When the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> emissaries delivered an ultimatum to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> the next day, they were <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>amazed</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Amazed</b></span> to hear that a task force was in fact already en route; the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartan army</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> was marching to meet the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[38]
<br>
<br>In response, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> navy under <span style='color: blue'><b>Xanthippus</b></span> joined with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet off <span style='color: blue'><b>Delos</b></span>. They were then approached by a delegation from <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span>, who suggested that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> cities would revolt if the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet successfully engaged the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet.[39] They furthermore pointed out the poor morale and reduced seaworthiness of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet.[39] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leotychides</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leotychidas</b></span> decided to attempt this, and sailed for <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span>.[40]

<br>When the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> heard that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet was approaching, they set sail from <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span> towards the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> mainland.[41] According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, this was because they had decided in council that they could not beat the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> in a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>naval battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naval_warfare</b></span>.[41] They sent the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenician</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span> ships away (<span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> does not explain why), and then sailed to the shore near <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mount Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mycale</b></span>.[41] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> had left an army there, under the command of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tigranes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tigranes_the_Great</b></span>, to guard <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>.[41] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> beached their ships, built a palisade around them, and prepared to guard the makeshift fort.[42]
<br>
<br>Finding the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet gone from <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> were thrown into uncertainty. Eventually they resolved that they would sail to the mainland, and equipped themselves for a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>naval battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naval_warfare</b></span>.[43] However, when the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> approached <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> did not attempt to engage them, and remained guarding their camp. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leotychides</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leotychidas</b></span> therefore sailed as close to the camp as possible, and had a herald make an appeal to the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span>:
<br>
<br>"Men of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>, you who hear us, understand what I say, for by no means will the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> understand anything I charge you with when we join <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>; first of all it is right for each man to remember his freedom and next the battle-cry <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hebe</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hebe_Tien</b></span>: and let him who hears me tell him who has not heard it."[43]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> suggests that the purpose of this message was twofold; firstly to encourage the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span>, unbeknownst to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, to fight for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> (or at least not to fight against them); or, if the message became known to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, to make the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> mistrust the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span>.[43]
<br>
<br>Following this appeal, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> also beached their ships, and began to prepare to assault the camp.[44] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span>, guessing that their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Samian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Samos</b></span> contingent would support the allies, took away their armour.[44] Furthermore, they sent the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> to guard the passes over <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>, suspecting that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> might also defect.[44] Thus rid of two potential internal threats, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> left their camp, and prepared for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>.[43][44] It is probable that the relatively small number of marines that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> had disembarked for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> made them overconfident, encouraging the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> to leave the safety of their camp.[45]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> reports that as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> approached the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> camp, rumour spread amongst them of an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> victory at <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>;[46] Diodorus also claims that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leotychides</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leotychidas</b></span> informed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> of victory at <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> before the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> began.[47] Their morale boosted by this <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>omen</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Omen</b></span>, they set forth to win their own victory.[46] Various explanations have been attempted to explain this occurrence, and also the alleged fact that <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span> took place on the same day. Green suggests that following the victory at <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> commander <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span> took control of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>beacon system</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Byzantine_beacon_system</b></span> that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> had used to communicate with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>, and used it to send tidings of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet.[48] This would explain the rumour of victory and near simultaneous attack, but is only one possible theory.[45]

Ancient <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>kylix</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kylix</b></span>, 5th century BC.
<br>The number of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> ships and men involved with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> are, as so often in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, somewhat problematic. It is clear that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet did not dare conduct operations against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, and thus must have been approximately equal to, or smaller than the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet.[49][50] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> gives the size of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet at 300 ships;[50] the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> had 378 at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>, but must have suffered significant losses, and so they probably also had around 300 in total (though not necessarily all these ships formed part of the allied fleet for 479 BC).[49] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenician</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span> ships were dismissed from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet before the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, which reduced its strength further.[41]
<br>
<br>Diodorus tells us that to guard the camp and the ships the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> gathered 100,000 men in total,[51] while <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> suggests that there were 60,000 men in the army under the command of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tigranes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tigranes_the_Great</b></span>.[41] Squaring these two accounts, might suggest that there were c. 40,000 men with the fleet. Given that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet appears to have been undermanned in the aftermath of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>, 200-300 ships would indeed give this number of naval personnel (using <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s standard complement of 200 men per ship).[39] However, this total of 100,000 is probably too high; to accommodate 100,000 men and 200+ ships, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> camp would have to have been enormous. Estimates made of <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>'s huge camp at <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>, which was planned and built with plenty of time, suggest it might have accommodated 70,000-120,000 men;[52][53][54] it is improbable that such a large camp could have been built at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span> in the time-frame that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> suggests. It is therefore possible that the 60,000 quoted by <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> is actually the total number of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> present at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>; the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> certainly outnumbered the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span>, emerging from the palisade in confidence after seeing the smaller number of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> troops.[45][55]
<br>
<br>Numbers of ships and men for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> are also somewhat problematic. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> claims that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leotychides</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leotychidas</b></span> had 110 triremes under his command.[56] However, the previous year, the allies had fielded 271 triremes at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span>, and then 378 at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>.[57][58] We are also told that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> had "command of the sea" after <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>, which implies that they could at least equal the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet.[49] Diodorus, on the other hand, tells us the allies had 250 ships, which is more consistent with their force levels of the previous year.[51] These two numbers can be reconciled by assuming that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leotychides</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leotychidas</b></span> had 110 triremes under his command before being joined by <span style='color: blue'><b>Xanthippus</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> ships, after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> army had marched out from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>. This is the approach taken by <span style='color: blue'><b>Holland</b></span>, and gives a naval force which might well match the remnants of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet.[45]

<br>Although the Athenians had sent 8,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> to <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>,[59] they would still have had ample manpower to man a large fleet of triremes, especially since rowers tended to be of the lower classes (the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>thetes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Solonian_Constitution</b></span>) who could not afford the equipment to fight as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>.[60] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The standard</span> <span style='color: green'><b>London_Evening_Standard</b></span> complement of a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>trireme</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Trireme</b></span> was 200 men, including 14 marines.[61] In the second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, each <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> ship had carried thirty extra marines,[62] and this was probably also true in the first invasion when the whole invasion force was apparently carried in triremes.[61] Furthermore, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chios</b></span> ships at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> also carried 40 marines each. This suggests that a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>trireme</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Trireme</b></span> could probably carry a maximum of 40–45 soldiers—triremes seem to have been easily destabilised by extra weight.[63] Combining these numbers yields a range of 22,000–58,000 men for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span>, with 3,300–11,250 more heavily armoured marines.[62] Estimates of around 40,000 men are given in some sources, which is approximately the median of the possible range, and seems as likely a number as any.[64] However, since only the marines were expected to fight hand to hand, the rowers in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet were probably not equipped to fight in a land <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>; it is likely therefore that it was only the marines who contested the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>.[45]
<br>
<br>From a strategic point of view, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> was not necessary for either side; the main strategic theatre was mainland <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> itself. Although destroying the enemy navy would result in a clear strategic advantage for both sides, attempting this risked the loss of their own navy. The actions of the two sides thus reflect more upon their morale and confidence than on any strategic considerations. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span>, seeing little to gain in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, demoralised and riven with dissent, thus sought to avoid a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>naval battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naval_warfare</b></span>.[41][49][50][51] Conversely, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span>, who had initially been as nervous of a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>,[65] sought to press home their morale advantage once they were informed of the state of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet.[40]
<br>
<br>Tactically, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet should have held the advantage at sea, since the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> part of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet was, despite their efforts at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>, still raw in seamanship.[66] However, whether because of their low morale, or because they were in fact outnumbered, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> sought instead the tactical advantage of joining up with the army under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tigranes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tigranes_the_Great</b></span>, and fortifying a position.[40][41] However, when the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> chose to fight on land, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> then threw away the advantage of their fortifications by emerging to fight the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> in the open field.[51] Furthermore, as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span> had shown, large numbers conferred little advantage against the more heavily armoured <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>; thus, as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> began, it was the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> who had the tactical upper hand.[67]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> seem to have formed into two wings; on the right were the Athenians, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Corinth</b></span>, Sicyonians and Troezenians, and on the left were the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> with other contingents.[68] The right wing marched across level ground straight towards the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> camp, whilst the left wing attempted to outflank the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> by passing through more broken ground.[68] The right wing thus began fighting with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> while the left wing was still approaching.[68] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> reports that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fought well at first, but that the Athenians and the contingents with them wished to win the victory before the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> arrived, and thus attacked ever more zealously.[68]
<br>
<br>Although the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> stood their ground for a while, they eventually broke and fled to the palisade.[68] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The soldiers</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Soldiers</b></span> of the right wing followed them into the camp, at which point many of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army fled from the camp, except the ethnic <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> troops, who grouped together and fought the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> soldiers who entered the camp.[68] Finally, the left wing arrived, outflanking the camp and falling on the rear of the remaining <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> forces, thereby completing the rout.[45][69]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> tells us that, on seeing the outcome of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> hung in the balance, the disarmed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Samians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Samos</b></span> had joined in on the side of the allies, doing what they could.[69] This inspired the other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> contingents to turn on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> as well.[69] At which stage in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> this happened is not clear; the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Samians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Samos</b></span> were presumably not in the main <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> line (being disarmed), so it may have been after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> retreated to the camp. Meanwhile, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> who were guarding the passes of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span> also turned on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. At first they misdirected the fleeing <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> contingents so that they ended up back amongst the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> troops; then, perhaps seeing the outcome of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> was certain, they began killing the fleeing <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[70]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> does not mention specific figures for casualties, merely saying that losses were heavy on both sides.[69] The Sicyonians in particular suffered, also losing their general <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Perilaus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Perileos</b></span>.[69] On the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> side, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>admiral</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Admiral</b></span> Mardontes and the general <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tigranes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tigranes_the_Great</b></span> were both killed, though Artayntes escaped.[69] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> says that a few <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> troops escaped the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> and made their way to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>.[71] Diodorus claims that there were 40,000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> casualties, and also suggests that the survivors made their way to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>.[55]
<br>
<br>When the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> arrived, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> camp was looted and their beached ships destroyed.[72] Returning to <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span> they then discussed their next moves.[72] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leotychides</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leotychidas</b></span> proposed that they evacuate the cities of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> and bring the population to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> mainland, since it would be difficult to defend <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> against further <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> attacks.[72] <span style='color: blue'><b>Xanthippus</b></span> however vehemently objected to this, since the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> cities were originally <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek colonies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Colonies_in_antiquity</b></span>.[72] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> later joined the Athenians in the "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>" against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[72]
<br>
<br>With the twin victories of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>, the second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> was over. Moreover, the threat of a future invasion was abated; although the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> remained worried that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> would try again, over time it became apparent that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> desire to conquer <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> was much diminished.[73]
<br>
<br>After the victory at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet sailed to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> to break down the pontoon bridges, but found that this was already done.[74] The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians remained to attack the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chersonesos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gallipoli</b></span>, still held by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[74] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> in the region, and their allies, made for Sestos, the strongest town in the region, and the Athenians laid <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span> to them there. After a protracted <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span>, Sestos fell to the Athenians, marking the beginning of a new phase in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek counterattack</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>.[75] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> ended his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span> after the Siege of Sestos. Over the next 30 years, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, primarily the Athenian-dominated <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>, would expel (or help expel) the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean islands</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>.[75] Peace with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> finally came in 449 BC with the Peace of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Callias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Callias_II</b></span>, finally ending the half-century of warfare.[75]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Xenophon</b></span> (431-355 BC), a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mercenary</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mercenary</b></span> commander in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> service, who later became a historian
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> have great significance in ancient history as the battles which decisively ended the second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, thereby swinging the balance of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> in favour of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[75] The Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> saved <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> from immediate conquest, but it was <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> which effectively ended that threat.[75] However, neither of these battles are as well known as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>. The reason for this discrepancy is not entirely clear; it might however be a result of the circumstances in which the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> was fought. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The fame</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Fame</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span> certainly lies in the doomed heroism of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> in the face of overwhelming numbers;[76] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> perhaps because they were both fought against the odds, and in dire strategic situations. Conversely, the Battles of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span> were both fought from a relative position of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> strength, and against lesser odds; perhaps the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> were even expecting to win and had certainly seen the opportunity to deal the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>final blow</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Final_Blow</b></span>.[75][77]
<br>
<br>Militarily, the major lesson of both <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> (since both were fought on land) was the repeated confirmation of the superiority of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> over the more lightly armed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> infantry, as had first been demonstrated at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>.[78] Taking on this lesson, after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> empire started recruiting and relying on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mercenaries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mercenary</b></span>.[79] This was amply illustrated later on by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ten Thousand</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ten_Thousand_(Greek_mercenaries)</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Xenophon</b></span>
