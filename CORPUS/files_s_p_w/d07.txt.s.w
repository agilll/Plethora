Ancient_Greece civilization, the period following Mycenaean_Greece, which ended about 1200 Common_Era, to the death of Alexander_the_Great, in 323 Common_Era. It was a period of political, philosophical, artistic, and scientific achievements that formed a legacy with unparalleled influence on Western_culture.

The period between the catastrophic end of the Mycenaean_Greece and about 900 Common_Era is often called a Greek_Dark_Ages. It was a time about which Ancient_Greece of the Classical age had confused and actually false notions. Thucydides, the great Ancient_history of the 5th century Common_Era, wrote a sketch of Ancient_Greece history from the Trojan_War to his own day, in which he notoriously fails, in the appropriate chapter, to signal any kind of dramatic rupture. (He does, however, speak of Ancient_Greece settling down gradually and colonizing Italian_Peninsula, Sicily, and what is now western Turkey. This surely implies that Ancient_Greece was settling down after something.) Thucydides does indeed display sound knowledge of the series of migrations by which Ancient_Greece was resettled in the post-Mycenaean period. The most famous of these was the Dorian_invasion, which the Ancient_Greece called, or connected with, the legendary return of the descendants of Heracles. Although much about that invasion is problematic—it left little or no archaeological trace at the point in time where tradition puts it—the problems are of no concern here. Important for the understanding of the Archaic_Greece and Classical periods, however, is the powerful belief in Dorianism as a linguistic and religious concept. Thucydides casually but significantly mentions soldiers speaking the Doric_Greek in a narrative about ordinary military matters in the year 426. That is a surprisingly abstract way of looking at the subdivisions of the Ancient_Greece, because it would have been more natural for a 5th-century Ancient_Greece to identify soldiers by home cities. Equally important to the understanding of this period is the hostility to Doric_Greek, usually on the part of Ionic_Greek, another linguistic and religious Subgroup, whose most-famous City was Classical_Athens. So extreme was this hostility that Doric_Greek were prohibited from entering Ionic_Greek sanctuaries; extant today is a 5th-century example of such a prohibition, an inscription from the island of Paros.

Phenomena such as the tension between Doric_Greek and Ionic_Greek that have their origins in the Greek_Dark_Ages are a reminder that Ancient_Greece civilization did not emerge either unannounced or uncontaminated by what had gone before. The_Dark_Age_(Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer) itself is beyond the scope of this article. One is bound to notice, however, that archaeological finds tend to call into question the whole concept of a Greek_Dark_Ages by showing that certain features of Ancient_Greece civilization once thought not to antedate about 800 Common_Era can actually be pushed back by as much as two centuries. One example, chosen for its relevance to the emergence of the Ancient_Greece Polis, or polis, will suffice. In 1981 archaeology pulled back the curtain on the darkest phase of all, the Protogeometric_style (c. 1075–900 Common_Era), which takes its name from the geometric shapes painted on Pottery. A grave, rich by the standards of any period, was uncovered at a site called Lefkandi on Euboea, the island along the eastern flank of Attica (the territory controlled by Athens). The_Grave_(poem), which dates to about 1000 Common_Era, contains the (probably cremated) remains of a man and a woman. The large bronze vessel in which the man’s ashes were deposited came from Cyprus, and the gold items buried with the woman are splendid and sophisticated in their workmanship. Remains of horses were found as well; the animals had been buried with their Snaffle_bit bits. The_Grave_(poem) was within a large collapsed house, whose form anticipates that of the Greek_language temples two centuries later. Previously it had been thought that those temples were one of the first manifestations of the monumentalizing associated with the beginnings of the Polis. Thus, that find and those made in a set of nearby cemeteries in the years before 1980 attesting further contacts between Ancient_Egypt and Cyprus between 1000 and 800 Common_Era are important evidence. They show that one corner of one island of Ancient_Greece, at least, was neither impoverished nor isolated in a period usually thought to have been both. The difficulty is to know just how exceptional Lefkandi was, but in any view it has revised former ideas about what was and what was not possible at the beginning of the 1st millennium Common_Era.

The term colonization, although it may be convenient and widely used, is misleading. When applied to Archaic_Greece, it should not necessarily be taken to imply the state-sponsored sending out of definite numbers of settlers, as the later Roman origin of the word implies. For one thing, it will be seen that state formation may itself be a product of the colonizing movement.

The first date in Ancient_Greece history is 776_BC, the year of the first Ancient_Olympic_Games. It was computed by a 5th-century-BCE researcher called Hippias. He was originally from Elis, a place in the western Peloponnese in whose territory Opel_Olympia itself is situated. This date and the list of early victors, transmitted by another literary tradition, are likely to be reliable, if only because the list is so unassuming in its early reaches. That is to say, local victors predominate, including some Messene. Messene lost its independence to neighbouring Sparta during the course of the 8th century, and this fact is an additional guarantee of the reliability of the early Olympic victor list: Messenian victors would hardly have been invented at a time when Messene as a political entity had ceased to exist. Clearly, then, record keeping and organized activity involving more than one community and centring on a sanctuary, such as Opel_Olympia, go back to the early 8th century. (Such competitive activity is an example of what has been called peer-polity interaction.) Records imply a degree of literacy, and there too the tradition about the 8th century has been confirmed by late 20th-century finds. A cup, bearing the inscription in Greek_language in the Euboean script I am the cup of Nestor_the_Chronicler, can be securely dated to before 700 Common_Era. It was found at an island site called Ischia (Ischia) on the Bay of Naples.

The early overseas activity of the Euboea has already been remarked upon in connection with the discoveries at Lefkandi. They were the prime movers in the more or less organized—or, at any rate, remembered and recorded—phase of Greek_language overseas settlement, a process known as colonization. (Euboean priority can be taken as absolutely certain because archaeology supports the literary tradition of the Roman historian Livy and others: Euboean Pottery_of_ancient_Greece has been found both at Ischia to the west and at the Turkish_language site of Al-Mina to the east.) This more-organized phase began in Italy about 750 and in Sicily in 734 Common_Era; its episodes were remembered, perhaps in writing, by the colonies themselves. The word organized needs to be stressed, because various considerations make it necessary to push back beyond that date the beginning of Ancient_Greece colonization. First, it is clear from archaeological finds, such as the Lefkandi material, and from other new evidence that the Ancient_Greece had already, before 750 or 734, confronted and exchanged goods with the inhabitants of Italian_Peninsula and Sicily. Second, Thucydides says that Greek_Dark_Ages Classical_Athens sent colonies to Ionia, and archaeology bears this out—however much one discounts for propagandist exaggeration by the imperial Classical_Athens of Thucydides’ own time of its Prehistory colonizing role. However, after the founding of Cumae (a mainland Italian_language offshoot of the island settlement of Ischia) about 750 Common_Era and of Sicily Naxos and Syracuse in 734 and 733, respectively, there was an explosion of colonies to all points of the Compass. The only exceptions were those areas, such as Ancient_Egypt or inner Anatolia, where the inhabitants were too militarily and politically advanced to be easily overrun.

One may ask why the Ancient_Greece suddenly began to launch these overseas projects. It seems that commercial interests, greed, and sheer curiosity were the motivating forces. An older view, according to which Archaic_Greece exported its surplus population because of an uncontrollable rise in population, must be regarded as largely discredited. In the first place, the earliest well-documented colonial operations were small-scale affairs, too small to make much difference to the situation of the sending community (the metropolis, or Mother_City_F.C.). That is certainly true of the colonization of Cyrenaica, in North_Africa, from the island of Santorini (Santorini); on this point, an inscription has confirmed the classic account by the 5th-century Ancient_Greece historian Herodotus. In the second place, population was not uncontrollable in principle: artificial means such as Infanticide were available, not to mention more-modern techniques like Birth_control. Considerations of this kind much reduce the evidential value of discoveries establishing, for example, that the number of graves in Attica and the Argolis (the area round Argos) increased dramatically in the later Greek_Dark_Ages or that there was a serious Drought in 8th-century Attica (that is the admitted implication of a number of dried-up wells in the Ancient_Agora_of_Athens, or civic centre). In fact, no single explanation for the colonizing activity is plausible. Political difficulties at home might sometimes be a factor, as, for instance, at Sparta, which in the 8th century sent out a Colonies_in_antiquity to Taras (Taranto) in Italy as a way of getting rid of an unwanted Mestizo group. Nor can one rule out simple craving for excitement and a desire to see the world. The Lyric_poetry of the energetic and high-strung Poetry Archilochus, a 7th-century Parian involved in the colonization of Thasos, shows the kind of lively minded individual who might be involved in the colonizing movement.

So far, the vague term community has been used for places that sent out colonies. Such Vagueness is historically appropriate, because those places themselves were scarcely constituted as united entities, such as a City, or polis. For example, it is a curious fact that Corinth, which in 733 colonized Syracuse_University in Sicily, was itself scarcely a properly constituted polis in 733. (The formation of Corinth as a united entity is to be put in the second half of the 8th century, with precisely the colonization of Syracuse_University as its first collective act.)

The name given to polis formation by the Ancient_Greece themselves was Synoecism, literally a gathering together. Synoikismos could take one or both of two forms—it could be a physical concentration of the population in a single City or an act of purely political unification that allowed the population to continue living in a dispersed way. The classic discussion is by Thucydides, who distinguishes between the two kinds of Synoecism more carefully than do some of his modern critics. He makes the correct point that Attica was politically Synoecism at an early date but not physically Synoecism until 431 Common_Era when Pericles as part of his war policy brought the large rural population behind the City walls of Classical_Athens. A more extreme instance of a polis that was never fully Synoecism in the physical sense was Sparta, which, as Thucydides elsewhere says, remained settled by villages in the old Ancient_Greece way. It was an act of conscious arrogance, a way of claiming to be invulnerable from attack and not to need the walls that Thucydides again and again treats as the sign and guarantee of civilized polis life. The Urban_history of Sparta makes an interesting case history showing that Mycenaean_Greece Sparta was not so physically or psychologically secure as its Ancient_Greece and Roman successors. The administrative centre of Mycenaean_Greece Sparta was probably in the Párnon Mountains at the excavated site of the Menelaion. Then Archaic_Greece and Classical Sparta moved down to the Plain. Byzantine_Empire Sparta, more insecure, moved out of the Plain again to Perch on the site of Mystras on the opposite western Mountain, Taygetus. Finally, modern Sparta is situated, once again peacefully and confidently, on its old site on the Plain of the river Eurotas.

The enabling factors behind the beginnings of the Greek_language polis have been the subject of intense discussion. One approach connects the beginnings of the polis with the first monumental buildings, usually temples like the great early 8th-century Ancient_Greek_temple of Hera on the island of Samos. The concentration of resources and effort required for such constructions presupposes the formation of self-conscious polis units and may actually have accelerated it. As stated above, however, the evidence from Lefkandi makes it hard to see the construction of such monumental buildings as a sufficient cause for the emergence of the polis, a process or event nobody has yet tried to date as early as 1000 Common_Era.

Another related theory argues that the birth of the Ancient_Greece City was signaled by the placing of rural sanctuaries at the margins of the territory that a community sought to define as its own. That theory fits admirably a number of Peloponnesian sanctuaries; for instance, the Ancient_Greek_temple complex of Hera staked out a claim, on the part of relatively distant Argos, to the Plain stretching between City and sanctuary, and the Corinth sanctuary on the Promontory of Perachora, also dedicated to Hera, performed the same function. Yet there are difficulties. It seems that the Isthmus_of_Corinth sanctuary, which at first sight seems a good candidate for another Corinth rural sanctuary, was already operational as early as 900 Common_Era, in the Protogeometric_style, and that date is surely too early for polis formation. Nor does the theory easily account for the rural Ancient_Greek_temple of the goddess Aphaea in the middle of Aegina. The sanctuary is admittedly a long way from the town of Aegina, but Aegina is an island, and there is no obvious neighbour against whom territorial claims could plausibly have been asserted. Finally, a theory that has to treat the best-known polis—namely, Athens—and Attica as in every respect exceptional is not satisfactory: there is no History_of_Athens equivalent of the Heraion_of_Argos.

A third theory attacks the problem of the beginnings of the polis through burial practice. In the 8th century (it is said) formal burial became more generally available, and that democratization of burial is evidence for a fundamentally new attitude toward society. The theory seeks to associate the new attitude with the growth of the polis. There is, however, insufficient archaeological and historical evidence for that view (which involves an implausible hypothesis that the process postulated was discontinuous and actually reversed for a brief period at a date later than the 8th century). Moreover, it is vulnerable to the converse objection as that raised against the second theory: the evidence for the third theory is almost exclusively Attica, and so, even if it were true, it would explain History_of_Athens and only History_of_Athens.

Fourth, one may consider a theory whose unspoken premise is a kind of Environmental_determinism. Perhaps the Ancient_Greece landscape itself, with its small Alluvial_plain plains often surrounded by defensible Mountain systems, somehow prompted the formation of small and acrimonious Polis, Endlessly_(album) going to war over boundaries. That view has its attractions, but the obvious objection is that, when Ancient_Greece went to more-open areas such as Italy, Sicily, and North_Africa, they seem to have taken their animosities with them. That in turn invites speculations of a psychologically Determinism sort; one has to ask, without hope of an answer, whether the Ancient_Greece were naturally particularist.

A fifth enabling factor that should be borne in mind is the influence of the colonizing movement itself. The political structure of the metropolis, or sending City, may sometimes have been inchoate. The new Colonies_in_antiquity, however, threatened by hostile native neighbours, rapidly had to get its act together if it was to be a viable cell of Hellenistic_period on Foreign_Soil. That effort in turn affected the situation in the metropolis, because Colonies_in_antiquity often kept close religious and social links with it. A 4th-century inscription, for instance, attests close ties between Miletus and its daughter City Olbia in the Black_Sea region. Here, however, as so often in Ancient_Greece history, generalization is dangerous; some mother-daughter relationships, like that between Corinth and Corfu (Corfu), were bad virtually from the start.

A related factor is Phoenicia influence (related, because the early Phoenicia were great colonizers, who must often have met trading Ancient_Greece). The Phoenicia coast was settled by communities similar in many respects to the early Ancient_Greece Polis. It is arguable that Phoenicia influence, and Phoenician_alphabet influence generally, on early Ancient_Greece has been seriously underrated.

Theories such as these are stimulating and may each contain a particle of truth. The better position, however, is that generalization itself is as yet premature; in particular, archaeologically based theoretical reconstructions need much more refining. All one can say in summary is that in roughly the same period—namely, the 8th century—a number of areas, such as Corinth and Megara, began to define their borders, deny autonomy to their constituent villages, and generally act as separate states. Attica’s political Synoecism, which occurred a little earlier, was complete perhaps about 900. Tempting though it is to seek a single explanatory model for those very roughly contemporaneous processes, one should perhaps allow that different paths of development were followed in different areas, even in areas next door to each other. After all, the Archaic_Greece and Classical histories of mighty democratic imperial Athens, of the miserable polis of Megara which nevertheless colonized Byzantium, of wealthy, Oligarchy Ancient_Corinth, and of federal Boeotia were all very different even though Athens, Megara, Ancient_Corinth, and Boeotia were close neighbours.

One is perhaps on firmer ground when one examines the evidence for prepolis aggregations of larger units, often religious in character. There are a number of such associations whose origins lie in the Greek_Dark_Ages and whose existence surely promoted some feeling of local and particularist identity among the participants. The Ionians in Anatolia formed themselves into a confederation of 12 communities, the Ionians Dodecapolis, with a common meeting place; and there were comparable groupings among the Dorians of Anatolia and even among the Carians (partially Ancient_Greece non-Greeks) in the same part of the world. The central location for such organizations was characteristically small and insignificant. One poorly attested but intriguing early Archaic_Greece league was the Kalaureia Amphictyony (an Amphictyonic_League was a religious league of dwellers round about). Kalaureia, the Small_Island_(TV_film) now called Póros, was not a place of any consequence in itself, but the league’s seven members included Athens and Aegina, two major Ancient_Greece Polis. The most famous and enduring such Amphictyonic_League, however, was the one that, originally from a distance, administered the affairs of the sanctuary of Delphi in central Ancient_Greece. That sanctuary contained the most-famous, though not the oldest, Ancient_Greece Delphi (the oldest was at Dodona); oracles were a mechanism by which divinely inspired utterances were produced in answer to specific questions. Finally, it is worth noting an adventurous suggestion that Lefkandi itself might have been the centre of some kind of religious Amphictyonic_League, but, if so, this would be an exception to the principle that religious centres tended themselves to be insignificant, however mighty their participating members.

Before attempting to characterize Archaic_Greece, one must admit candidly that the evidence is unsatisfactory. Only for Classical_Athens is anything like a proper political tradition known, and Classical_Athens’s development toward the Athenian_democracy of the 5th century was amazingly and untypically rapid by comparison with other states, many of which never became democratic at all. A tiny but salutary scrap of evidence makes this point: Thucydides in Book II of his History of the Peloponnesian_War casually mentions a man called Evarchus as Tyrant of a small northwestern Ancient_Greece polis called Nicomedia in the 420s Common_Era. But for this chance mention, one would never have guessed that tyranny could have existed or persisted in such a place so late or so long. Another difficulty is that, while a fair amount about the social structure of Classical_Greece is known, some of it must go back to Archaic_Greece times; just how much is disputed.

There is a further complication. In both the political and the social spheres, one has to reckon—chiefly at History_of_Athens, but elsewhere too—with Invented_tradition, a distorting element for which proper allowance is only now beginning to be made. Thus, it seems that not just Lycurgus_of_Sparta, the famous Spartan lawgiver (whose historicity was doubted even in Ancient_Greece), but even a reforming figure like Solon of History_of_Athens, who certainly existed in the 6th century and large fragments of whose poetry still survive, was in some respects what anthropologists call a Culture_hero. Much was projected onto him anachronistically or just wrongly, and reformers in later generations established their credentials by claiming (if they were reactionaries) that they were trying to get back to Solon or (if they were democrats) that Solon was their founding father. Such errors should not induce too much pessimism: at Athens at least, individual aristocratic families preserved oral traditions, which affected the later literary records in ways that can be properly understood with the help of anthropological analogy. That is to say, not all the evidence so preserved is unusable, but it needs handling in special ways.

It has even been argued that social life too was creatively manipulated. Later Greek_language cities contained, alongside such transparent political institutions as the Popular Assembly and the Deliberative (Probouleutic) Council, a more-opaque set of institutions, ostensibly based on Kinship groupings. The biggest and most basic of these groupings were the Phyle, or tribes, according to which the citizen body was subdivided. Thus, all Dorians states had the same three tribes, and there were four Ionians tribes (although Ionians states were less conservative than Dorians, and one finds among them a greater readiness to innovate; late 6th-century Athens, for example, switched from a four-tribe hereditary system of citizenship to a 10-tribe one based on simple residence as well as descent). Smaller subdivisions were the Phratry, a word connected with a philological Proto-Indo-European_root meaning brother, and the Genos, a smaller cluster of families (oikoi).

The existence of these groupings in historical times is beyond question; one finds them controlling citizen intake (as in the so-called Demotionidai inscription from the Attica village of Decelea, datable to as late as the early 4th century Common_Era) and entering into complicated property arrangements. What has become a matter of debate, however, is the question of just how old they actually were. According to the most-skeptical view, the whole apparatus of tribe and Genos was an invention without any Greek_Dark_Ages history to legitimate it. This view, which rests partly on the near absence of the relevant Kinship_terminology in Homer, is not ultimately convincing in its hypothesis of a kind of complicated collective fraud on posterity. Yet it is right to allow for an element of conscious antiquarianism at certain periods (the 320s in Classical_Athens being one), which may well have affected specific traditions.
Society and values

The world of the colonizing states was aristocratic in the sense that a small number of exclusive clans within cities monopolized citizenship and political control. At Corinth, for example, political control was monopolized by the adult males of a single Clan, the Bacchiadae. They perhaps numbered no more than a couple of hundred. At Classical_Athens there was a general class of Eupatridae, a word that just means people of good descent—i.e., aristocrats. (The word may have had a simultaneous but narrower application to one single Genos. This, however, is disputed, and, in any event, that hypothetical family was only one among many privileged genē. The case, therefore, is not analogous to that of the Bacchiadae.) It is unlikely that the Eupatridae were as rigidly defined as the Bacchiadae, and the negative tradition that Solon in the early 6th century deprived them of their exclusive claim to political office may just be the excessively formal and precise way in which later ancient commentators described a positive change by which power was made more generally available than it had been before.

With regard to those same early Archaic_Greece times, one hears—for example, in the poetry of the 7th-century Boeotian Hesiod—of control, sometimes oppressively exercised, by Basileus (singular Basileus). That word is usually translated as kings, and such titles as the Athenian_democracy Basileus (an official, or Eponymous_archon, with a defined religious competence, conveniently but less correctly called the Eponymous_archon Basileus by modern scholars) are then explained as survivals of an age of Monarchy. That account in terms of fossilization certainly eases the awkwardness of explaining why, for instance, the wife of the Eponymous_archon Basileus was held to be ritually married to the god Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus. The very existence of kingship in Geometric (as opposed to Mycenaean_Greece) Ancient_Greece, however, has been challenged, and a case has been made (though not universally accepted) for seeing most of those Archaic_Greece Basileus not as kings in any sense but as hereditary nobles. In the latter case, there is no great difference between those Basileus and such aristocrats as the Bacchiadae.

Life inside the Archaic_Greece societies ruled by such families can be reconstructed only impressionistically and only at the top of the social scale; the evidence, to an extent unusual even in Ancient_Greek_art Classical_antiquity, is essentially elitist in its bias. Aristocratic values were transmitted both vertically, by family oral traditions, and horizontally, by means of a crucial institution known as the symposium, or feast, for which (many literary scholars now believe) much surviving Archaic_Greece poetry was originally written. Perhaps much fine painted pottery was also intended for that market, though the social and artistic significance of such pottery is debated. Some scholars insist that the really wealthy would at all times have used gold and silver vessels, which, however, have not survived in any numbers because they were melted down long ago.

Symposia were eating and dining occasions with a strong ritual element; their existence is reflected in the marked emphasis, in the Homeric poems, on ostentatious feasting and formal banqueting as assertions of status (what have been called feasts of merit). Thus, Sarpedon in Homer’s Iliad reminds Glaucus that both of them are honoured with seats of honour and full cups in Lycia and with land (a sacred precinct, or Temenos) to finance all the feasting. Symposia were confined to males (a reminder of the military ethos so prevalent in Homer); although when the institution was introduced, along with the Vine, to Etruria—where much of the visual evidence comes from—it changed its character and became open to both sexes. The Ancient_Greece symposium proper can be seen as an instrument of social control; it is a more-tangible unit of social organization, and one with better-attested Homeric antecedents, than the problematic genē or Phratry discussed above.

In Classical times, strong Homosexuality attachments were another way in which values were inculcated, passed on by the older man (the erastes) to the younger Pederasty_in_ancient_Greece, or beloved. The Gym was the venue where such relationships typically developed. As with the symposium, there was an almost ritual element to it all; certain gifts—such as, for example, the gift of a hare—were thought especially appropriate. The date, however, at which Greek_Homosexuality_(book) became a central cultural institution is problematic; it is notoriously absent from the Homeric poems, a fact that some scholars explain as being the result of poetic reticence. The more-plausible view is that Homosexuality was in some way connected with the rise of the polis and was part of what has been called the 8th-century renaissance. If so, Homer’s silence is after all significant: he does not mention it because in his time it was not yet important.

Both symposia and Gym in different ways mirrored or were preparatory to warfare (see below). Interpolis athletic competitions (such as the Ancient_Olympic_Games) are another reflection of warfare. Epinician poetry of the Classical_Greece (that is, victory poetry like that of Pindar, whose epinician odes celebrate the athletic victories of aristocratic individuals) constantly uses the language of war, fighting, and victory. Indeed, one influential view of organized athletic competitions is that they are a restructuring of the Instinct to hunt and kill.

With the great athletic festivals, which brought Ancient_Greece together at set intervals of years to Opel_Olympia and later to Delphi, Nemean_Games, and the Isthmus (the four great Panhellenic, or all-Greek, games), one passes from the internal organization of individual Ancient_Greece societies to their interrelationships. Two kinds of powerful interrelationship have already been noted—that between colonizing or Mother_City_F.C. and daughter City and the shared membership of an Amphictyonic_League. Mythical links between one City and another were maintained and exploited throughout all periods by a process which has been felicitously called Kinship diplomacy. The most common such link was that between mother and daughter City and involved the stressing of shared ancestry—that is, Common_descent from some mythical hero or founder figure. Such Kinship diplomacy was taken very seriously by all parties and as late as the Hellenistic_period was the basis for alliances or other sorts of common action. Modern historians tend to Portuguese_language the particularism of Ancient_Greece culture—i.e., the Apartheid and carefully cultivated local identity of the individual polis. Networks of Kinship diplomacy were one means by which this particularism was softened in practice.

At the individual level, the basic institution in intercity relationships was that of guest-friendship, or Xenia_motif. That was another area where ritual elements were present to such a marked degree that the whole institution has been called ritualized friendship. The same aristocrats who drank and heard poetry together inside their own communities naturally expected to find comparable groups inside other states. They cemented their ties, which had perhaps been formed on initially casual or trading visits, with formal relationships of Xenia_motif. At some point quite early in the Archaic_Greece that institution developed into something still more definite, the Proxeny. Proxeny were citizens of state A living in state A who looked after the interests of citizens of state B. The status of Proxeny was surely in origin hereditary, but by Thucydides’ time one hears of voluntary Proxeny (etheloproxenoi). The Ancient_Greece of the basic institution is not in doubt, however much the 5th-century Delian_League may have exploited and reshaped it for its own political convenience; a 7th-century inscription from the island of Corfu mentioning a Proxeny from Locris is the earliest attestation of the institution.

Another way of institutionalizing relationships between the nationals of different states was Epigamia, an arrangement by which the offspring of marriage were treated as citizens of the wife’s polis if the husband settled there; and so was the husband. Classical_Athens, for example, granted Epigamia to Euboea as late as the 5th century, a time when Classical_Athens citizenship was fiercely protected. There are still earlier instances: usually one hears of Epigamia when for one reason or another it was being suspended or denied. Thus, there was an early arrangement between the islands of Andros and Paros, which, Plutarch says, ended when relations went sour. More interesting is the statement, again by Plutarch, that there was no intermarriage between members of two of the villages, or Deme, of Attica, Pallini and Hagnous. Far from being evidence that these places were somehow originally separate states, the prohibition was more like a ban on Endogamy: in other words, the two communities were regarded—like members of a family—as being too close to be allowed to intermarry.

Thus, both marriage itself and prohibition of marriage were ways of defining the relations between communities, including communities within a single large state like Attica, and of keeping those relations friendly. One way in which ties of Xenia_motif and marriage can now be traced in detail is the scientific study of Greek_language personal names, because patterns of naming reflect social realities; foreign names enter a City’s name pool as a result of both formal connections and less formal ones, such as temporary residence. Such Onomastics evidence, as it is called, can now be studied in bulk and in depth, thanks to the computer-aided publication of all known Greek_language personal names, most of them attested from inscriptions.

The chief vehicle of interaction among Polis, however, was through warfare and through the formal suspension or renunciation of warfare by means of heavily ritualized Treaty (one of the most common words for such a treaty is spondai, which literally means libations to the guaranteeing gods). The earliest surviving inscriptional peace treaty for all time dates from the 6th century and was found at Opel_Olympia. Nonetheless, there were surely agreements to limit warfare over strips of boundary land before that date. Archaeology may offer unexpected help in this matter: it is possible and plausible that some Frontier zones were by tacit or explicit agreement left Crop_rotation. One such zone seems to have been the remote Skourta Plain, which separates part of northern Attica from Boeotia; preliminary surface survey (i.e., the estimation of settlement patterns by gathering of potsherds) carried out in and after 1985 suggests that it was—perhaps deliberately—left uncultivated in the Archaic_Greece.

An important landmark in interstate military relations of the kind considered here was the Lelantine_War. It was the earliest Ancient_Greek war (after the mythical Trojan_War) that had any claim to be considered general, in the sense that it involved distant allies on each side. Fought in perhaps the later 8th century between the two main communities of Euboea, Chalcis and Eretria, it took its name from the fertile Lelantine_Plain, which separates the cities and includes the site of Lefkandi. (It is an interesting modern suggestion that Lefkandi itself is the site of Old Eretria, abandoned about 700 Common_Era in favour of the Classical_antiquity site Eretria at the east end of the Plain, perhaps as a consequence of Eretria’s defeat in the war. This theory, however, needs to account for Herodotus’s statement that at the early 6th-century entertainment of the suitors of Cleisthenes of Sicyon there was one Lysanias from Eretria, then at the height of its prosperity.)

Other faraway Ancient_Greece states were somehow involved in the war; on this point Thucydides agrees with his great predecessor Herodotus. Thus, Samos supported Chalcis and Miletus, Eretria. Given Euboean priority in overseas settlement, it is natural to suppose that the links implied by the traditions about the Lelantine_War were the result of Euboean overseas Energy, but that Energy would hardly have turned casual contacts into actual alliances without a preliminary network of guest-friendships. Whether the Delphi at Delphi took sides in the war, as a modern speculation has it, is less certain, though there is no doubt that, by some means wholly mysterious to the 21st century, Delphi often provided updated information about possible sites for settlement and even (as over Cyrenaica) gave the original stimulus to the emigration.

One can be more confident in denying the thoroughly anachronistic notion that the Lelantine_War shows the existence of trade leagues at this early date. Religious amphictyonies are one thing, but trade leagues are quite another; the evidence, such as it is, suggests that early trade was carried on by entrepreneurial aristocratic individuals, who no doubt exploited their guest-friendships and formed more such friendships during their travels. It is true, however, that such individuals tended to come from areas where Arable_land was restricted, and to this extent it is legitimate to speak in a generic way of those areas as having in a sense a more commercially minded population than others. One example of such an area is the Lelantine_Plain, an exceptionally good piece of land on a notably barren and mountainous, though large, island. Herodotus described one such trader from the later Archaic_Greece, Sostratus_of_Cnidus of Aegina, a man of fabulous wealth. Then in the early 1970s a remarkable inscription was found in Etruria—a dedication to Apollo in the name of Sostratus_of_Cnidus of Aegina. This discovery revealed that the source of his wealth was trade with Etruria and other parts of Italian_Peninsula. Aegina is an island whose estimated Classical population of about 40,000 was supported by land capable of supporting only about 4,000. One may quarrel with the first figure as too large and the second figure as too pessimistic (it makes insufficient allowance for the possibilities of highly intensive land use). Even after adjustment, however, it is clear that Aegina needed to trade in order to live. It is not surprising to find Sostratus_of_Cnidus’s home City of Aegina included among the Ancient_Greece communities allowed to trade at Naucratis in Ancient_Egypt; that arrangement is described by Herodotus, and the site has been explored archaeologically. Aegina was the only participating City of Ancient_Greece proper, as opposed to places in the eastern Aegean_civilizations
