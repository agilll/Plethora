The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>, founded in 478 BC,[1] was an association of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states, with the amount of members numbering between 150 to 330[2][3][4]under the leadership of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, whose purpose was to continue fighting the Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> victory in the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Plataea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Plataea</b></span> at the end of the Second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. The League's modern[5] name derives from its official meeting place, the island of <span style='color: blue'><b>Delos</b></span>, where congresses were held in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_temple</b></span> and where the treasury stood until, in a symbolic gesture,[6] <span style='color: blue'><b>Pericles</b></span> moved it to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> in 454 BC.[7]
<br>
<br>Shortly after its inception, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> began to use the League's navy for its own purposes â€“ which led to its naming by historians as the Athenian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span>. This behavior frequently led to conflict between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and the less powerful members of the League. By 431 BC, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>' heavy-handed control of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> prompted the outbreak of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span>; the League was dissolved upon the war's conclusion in 404 BC under the direction of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lysander</b></span>, the Spartan commander.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> had their roots in the conquest of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>, and particularly <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>, by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> shortly after 550 BC. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> found the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> difficult to rule, eventually settling for sponsoring a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> in each <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>.[8] While <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> states had in the past often been ruled by tyrants, this was a form of arbitrary government that was on the decline.[9] By 500 BC, <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> appears to have been ripe for rebellion against these <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> clients. The simmering tension finally broke into open revolt due to the actions of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>. Attempting to save himself after a disastrous Persian-sponsored expedition in 499 BC, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> chose to declare <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span>.[10] This triggered similar revolutions across <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>, extending to Doris and <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeolis</b></span>, beginning the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>.[11]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> states of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> allowed themselves to be drawn into this conflict by <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>, and during their only campaigning season (498 BC) they contributed to the capture and burning of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> regional capital of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>.[12] After this, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> carried on (without further outside aid) for a further five years, until it was finally completely crushed by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. However, in a decision of great historic significance, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> king <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> the Great decided that, despite having subdued the revolt, there remained the unfinished business of exacting punishment on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> for supporting the revolt.[13] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> had severely threatened the stability of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>'s empire, and the states of mainland <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> would continue to threaten that stability unless dealt with. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> thus began to contemplate the complete conquest of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, beginning with the destruction of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>.[13]
<br>
<br>In the next two decades there would be two <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasions of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, occasioning, thanks to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historians, some of the most famous battles in history. During the first invasion, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean Islands</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Islands</b></span> were added to the Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> was duly destroyed.[14] However, the invasion ended in 490 BC with the decisive <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> victory at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>.[15] Between the two invasions, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> died, and responsibility for the war passed to his son <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>.[16]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> then personally led a second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> in 480 BC, taking an enormous (although oft-exaggerated) army and navy to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[17] Those <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> who chose to resist (the '<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span>') were defeated in the twin simultaneous battles of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span> on land and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span> at sea.[18] All of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> except the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnese</b></span> thus having fallen into <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> hands, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> then seeking to destroy the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> navy once and for all, suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>.[19] The following year, 479 BC, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> assembled the largest <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army yet seen and defeated the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion force at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Plataea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Plataea</b></span>, ending the invasion and the threat to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[20]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> fleet defeated the remnants of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet in the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span> near the islands of Salamisâ€”on the same day as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Plataea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Plataea</b></span>, according to tradition.[21] This action marks the end of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion, and the beginning of the next phase in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek counterattack</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>.[22] After <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> again revolted, with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> now <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>powerless</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Powerless_(TV_series)</b></span> to stop them.[23] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> fleet then sailed to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thracian Chersonese</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gallipoli</b></span>, still held by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, and besieged and captured the town of Sestos.[24] The following year, 478 BC, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span> sent a force to capture the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Byzantion</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Byzantium</b></span> (modern day <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Istanbul</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Constantinople</b></span>). The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span> was successful, but the behaviour of the Spartan general <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span> alienated many of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_I</b></span>, and resulted in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pausanias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pausanias_of_Sparta</b></span>'s recall.[25]
<br>
<br>After <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Byzantion</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Byzantium</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> was eager to end its involvement in the war. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> were of the view that, with the liberation of mainland <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>, the war's purpose had already been reached. There was also perhaps a feeling that establishing long-term security for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Asia</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> would prove impossible.[26] In the aftermath of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>, the Spartan king <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leotychides</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leotychidas</b></span> had proposed transplanting all the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> to <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span> as the only method of permanently freeing them from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> dominion.[26]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Xanthippus</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> commander at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>, had furiously rejected this; the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> cities had been <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> colonies, and the Athenians, if no-one else, would protect the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span>.[26] This marked the point at which the leadership of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> alliance effectively passed to the Athenians.[26] With the Spartan withdrawal after <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Byzantion</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Byzantium</b></span>, the leadership of the Athenians became explicit.
<br>
<br>The loose alliance of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> states which had fought against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>'s invasion had been dominated by <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian league</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_League</b></span>. With the withdrawal of these states, a congress was called on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>holy island</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lindisfarne</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Delos</b></span> to institute a new alliance to continue the fight against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>; hence the modern designation "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>". According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>, the official aim of the League was to "avenge the wrongs they suffered by ravaging the territory of the king."[27]
<br>
<br>In reality, this goal was divided into three main effortsâ€”to prepare for future invasion, to seek revenge against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, and to organize a means of dividing spoils of war. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The members</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Members</b></span> were given a choice of either offering armed forces or paying a tax to the joint treasury; most states chose the tax.[27] League members swore to have the same friends and enemies, and dropped ingots of iron into the sea to symbolize the permanence of their alliance. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> politician Aristides would spend the rest of his life occupied in the affairs of the alliance, dying (according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>) a few years later in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pontus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kingdom_of_Pontus</b></span>, whilst determining what the tax of new members was to be.[28]
<br>
<br>In the first ten years of the league's existence, <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span>/Kimon forced <span style='color: blue'><b>Karystos</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span> to join the league, conquered the island of <span style='color: blue'><b>Skyros</b></span> and sent <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> colonists there.[29]
<br>
<br>Over time, especially with the suppression of rebellions, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> exercised <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hegemony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hegemony</b></span> over the rest of the league. <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> describes how <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>'s control over the League grew:
<br>
<br>Of all the causes of defection, that connected with arrears of tribute and vessels, and with failure of service, was the chief; for the Athenians were very severe and exacting, and made themselves offensive by applying the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>screw</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Screw</b></span> of necessity to men who were not used to and in fact not disposed for any continuous labor. In some other respects the Athenians were not the old popular rulers they had been at first; and if they had more than their fair share of service, it was correspondingly easy for them to reduce any that tried to leave the confederacy. The Athenians also arranged for the other members of the league to pay its share of the expense in money instead of in ships and men, and for this the subject city-states had themselves to blame, their wish to get out of giving service making most leave their homes. Thus while <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> was increasing her navy with the funds they contributed, a revolt always found itself without enough resources or experienced leaders for war.[30]
<br>
<br>The first member of the league to attempt to secede was the island of <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span> in c. 471 BC.[31] After being defeated, <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span> is believed (based on similar, later revolts) to have been forced to tear down its walls along with losing its fleet and vote in the League.
<br>
<br>In 465 BC, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> founded the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>colony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Colonies_in_antiquity</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Amphipolis</b></span> on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Strymon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Struma_(river)</b></span> river. <span style='color: blue'><b>Thasos</b></span>, a member of the League, saw her interests in the mines of Mt. Pangaion threatened and defected from the League to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. She called to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> for assistance but was denied, as <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> was facing the largest <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>helot</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Helots</b></span> revolution in its history.[32]
<br>
<br>After more than two years of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thasos</b></span> surrendered to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> leader <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span> and was forced back into the league. As a result, the fortification walls of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thasos</b></span> were torn down, and they had to pay yearly tribute and fines. Additionally, their land, naval ships, and the mines of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thasos</b></span> were confiscated by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thasos</b></span> marks the transformation of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian league</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> from an alliance into, in the words of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>, a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hegemony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hegemony</b></span>.[33]
<br>
<br>In 461 BC, <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span> was ostracized and was succeeded in his influence by democrats such as <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephialtes</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Pericles</b></span>. This signaled a complete change in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> foreign policy, neglecting the alliance with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> and instead allying with her enemies, <span style='color: blue'><b>Argos</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Thessaly</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Megara</b></span> deserted the Spartan-led <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_League</b></span> and allied herself with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, allowing construction of a double line of walls across the Isthmus of <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> and protecting <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> from attack from that quarter. Roughly a decade earlier, due to encouragement from influential speaker <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, the Athenians had also constructed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Long Walls</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Long_Walls</b></span> connecting their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> to the <span style='color: blue'><b>Piraeus</b></span>, its port, making it effectively invulnerable to attack by land.
<br>
<br>In 454 BC, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> general <span style='color: blue'><b>Pericles</b></span> moved the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>'s treasury from <span style='color: blue'><b>Delos</b></span> to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, allegedly to keep it safe from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. However, <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> indicates that many of <span style='color: blue'><b>Pericles</b></span>' rivals viewed the transfer to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> as usurping monetary resources to fund elaborate building projects. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> also switched from accepting ships, men and weapons as dues from league members, to only accepting money.
<br>
<br>The new treasury established in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> was used for many purposes, not all relating to the defence of members of the league. It was from tribute paid to the league that <span style='color: blue'><b>Pericles</b></span> set to building the <span style='color: blue'><b>Parthenon</b></span> on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Acropolis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Acropolis_of_Athens</b></span>, replacing an older <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_temple</b></span>, as well as many other non-defense related expenditures. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> was turning from an alliance into an empire.
<br>
<br>War with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> continued. In 460 BC, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</b></span> revolted under local leaders the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> called <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Inaros</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Inaros_II</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Amyrtaeus</b></span>, who requested aid from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Pericles</b></span> led 250 ships, intended to attack <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyprus</b></span>, to their aid because it would further damage <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. After four years, however, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian rebellion</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Egyptian_revolution_of_1919</b></span> was defeated by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> general <span style='color: blue'><b>Megabyzus</b></span>, who captured the greater part of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> forces. In fact, according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Isocrates</b></span>, the Athenians and their allies lost some 20,000 men in the expedition, while modern estimates place the figure at 50,000 men and 250 ships including reinforcements.[34] The remainder escaped to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrene</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrenaica</b></span> and thence returned home.
<br>
<br>This was the Athenians' main (public) reason for moving the treasury of the League from <span style='color: blue'><b>Delos</b></span> to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, further consolidating their control over the League. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> followed up their victory by sending a fleet to re-establish their control over <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyprus</b></span>, and 200 ships were sent out to counter them under <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span>, who returned from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ostracism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ostracism</b></span> in 451 BC. He died during the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>blockade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Blockade</b></span> of Citium, though the fleet won a double victory by land and sea over the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> off <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyprus</b></span>.
<br>
<br>This <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> was the last major one fought against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. Many writers report that a peace treaty, known as the Peace of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Callias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Callias_II</b></span>, was formalized in 450 BC, but some writers believe that the treaty was a myth created later to inflate the stature of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>. However, an understanding was definitely reached, enabling the Athenians to focus their attention on events in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> proper.
<br>
<br>Soon, war with the Peloponnesians broke out. In 458 BC, the Athenians blockaded the island of <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span>, and simultaneously defended <span style='color: blue'><b>Megara</b></span> from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Corinth</b></span> by sending out an army composed of those too young or old for regular military service. The following year, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> sent an army into <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span>, reviving the power of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia</b></span> in order to help hold the Athenians in check. Their return was blocked, and they resolved to march on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, where the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Long Walls</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Long_Walls</b></span> were not yet completed, winning a victory at the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Tanagra</b></span>. All this accomplished, however, was to allow them to return home via the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Megarid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Megaris</b></span>. Two months later, the Athenians under <span style='color: blue'><b>Myronides</b></span> invaded <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span>, and winning the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Oenophyta</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Oenophyta</b></span> gained control of the whole country except <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Metropolis_of_Thebes_and_Livadeia</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Reverses followed peace with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> in 449 BC. The Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Coronea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Koroneia,_Boeotia</b></span>, in 447 BC, led to the abandonment of <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Megara</b></span> revolted, and while the former was restored to its status as a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tributary</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tribute</b></span> ally, the latter was a permanent loss. The Delian and Peloponnesian Leagues signed a peace treaty, which was set to endure for thirty years. It only lasted until 431 BC, when the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span> broke out.
<br>
<br>Those who revolted unsuccessfully during the war saw the example made of the Mytilenians, the principal people on <span style='color: blue'><b>Lesbos</b></span>. After an unsuccessful revolt, the Athenians ordered the death of the entire male population. After some thought, they rescinded this order, and only put to death the leading 1000 ringleaders of the revolt, and redistributed the land of the entire island to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> shareholders, who were sent out to reside on <span style='color: blue'><b>Lesbos</b></span>.
<br>
<br>This type of treatment was not reserved solely for those who revolted. <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> documents the example of Melos, a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>small island</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Small_Island_(TV_film)</b></span>, neutral in the war, though founded by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>. The Melians were offered a choice to join the Athenians, or be conquered. Choosing to resist, their town was besieged and conquered; the males were put to death and the women sold into <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>slavery</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Slavery</b></span> (see <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Melian dialogue</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege_of_Melos</b></span>).
<br>
<br>By 454, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> could be fairly characterised as an Athenian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span>; a key event of 454 was the moving of the treasury of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> from <span style='color: blue'><b>Delos</b></span> to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>. This is often seen as a key marker of the transition from alliance to empire, but while it is significant, it is important to view the period as a whole when considering the development of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>imperialism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>British_Empire</b></span>, and not to focus on a single event as being the main contributor to it. At the start of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Peloponnesian War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Peloponnesian_War</b></span>, only <span style='color: blue'><b>Chios</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Lesbos</b></span> were left to contribute ships, and these states were by now far too weak to secede without support. <span style='color: blue'><b>Lesbos</b></span> tried to revolt first, and failed completely. <span style='color: blue'><b>Chios</b></span>, the most powerful of the original members of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> save <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, was the last to revolt, and in the aftermath of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Syracusan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Syracuse,_Sicily</b></span> Expedition enjoyed success for several years, inspiring all of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> to revolt. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> was nonetheless eventually able to suppress these revolts.
<br>
<br>To further strengthen <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>' grip on its empire, <span style='color: blue'><b>Pericles</b></span> in 450 BC began a policy of establishing kleruchiaiâ€”quasi-colonies that remained tied to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and which served as garrisons to maintain control of the League's vast territory. Furthermore, <span style='color: blue'><b>Pericles</b></span> employed a number of offices to maintain <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>' empire: <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>proxenoi</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Proxeny</b></span>, who fostered <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>good relations</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Good_Relations</b></span> between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and League members; episkopoi and archontes, who oversaw the collection of tribute; and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hellenotamiai</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hellenotamiae</b></span>, who received the tribute on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>' behalf.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>' empire was not very stable and after 27 years of war, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, aided by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> internal strife, were able to defeat it. However it did not remain defeated for long. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Second Athenian Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Second_Athenian_Empire</b></span><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span>ritime <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>self-defense</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Self-defense</b></span> league, was founded in 377 BC and was led by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>
