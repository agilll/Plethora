<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> commonly known as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> the Great and also called <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> the Elder by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, was the founder of the Achaemenid <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span>, the first Persian <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span>. Under his rule, the empire embraced all the previous civilized states of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ancient Near</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Near_East</b></span> East, expanded vastly and eventually conquered most of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Southwest Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Western_Asia</b></span> and much of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Central Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Central_Asia</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue'><b>Caucasus</b></span>.

His regal titles in full were <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Great King</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Great_King</b></span>, King of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, King of <span style='color: blue'><b>Anshan</b></span>, King of Media, King of <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span>, King of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sumer</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Akkad</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Akkadian_Empire</b></span>, and King of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Four Corners</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Four_Corners</b></span> of the World. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Nabonidus Chronicle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nabonidus_Chronicle</b></span> notes the change in his title from simply "King of <span style='color: blue'><b>Anshan</b></span>", a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>, to "King of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>". <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyriologist</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Assyria</b></span> François Vallat wrote that "When <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> marched against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> is called ‘King of <span style='color: blue'><b>Anshan</b></span>’, but when <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> crosses the <span style='color: blue'><b>Tigris</b></span> on his way to <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span>, he is ‘King of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>’. The coup therefore took place between these two events."
<br>
<br>The reign of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> the Great lasted c. 30 years. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> built his empire by first conquering the Median <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span>, then the Lydian <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span>, and eventually the Neo-Babylonian <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span>. He led an expedition into <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Central Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Central_Asia</b></span>, which resulted in major campaigns that were described as having brought "into subjection every nation without exception".<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> did not venture into <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span>, and was alleged to have died in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, fighting the <span style='color: blue'><b>Massagetae</b></span> along the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Syr Darya</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Syr_Darya</b></span> in December 530 BC. He was succeeded by his son, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span>, who managed to add to the empire by conquering <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Nubia</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyrenaica</b></span> during his short rule.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> the Great respected the customs and religions of the lands he conquered. This became a very successful model for centralized administration and establishing a government working to the advantage and profit of its subjects.In fact, the administration of the empire through satraps and the vital principle of forming a government at <span style='color: blue'><b>Pasargadae</b></span> were the works of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> II.What is sometimes referred to as the Edict of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Restoration</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bourbon_Restoration</b></span> (actually two edicts) described in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bible</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hebrew_Bible</b></span> as being made by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> the Great left a lasting legacy on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Jewish</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Jews</b></span> religion, where, because of his policies in <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylonia</b></span>, he is referred to by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Jewish Bible</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hebrew_Bible</b></span> as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>messiah</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Messiah</b></span> (lit. "His anointed one") (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Isaiah</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Book_of_Isaiah</b></span> 45:1), and is the only non-Jewish figure in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bible</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hebrew_Bible</b></span> to be called so.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> the Great is also well recognized for his achievements in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>human rights</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Human_rights</b></span>, politics, and military strategy, as well as his influence on both Eastern and Western civilizations. Having originated from Persis, roughly corresponding to the modern Iranian province of Fars, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> has played a crucial role in defining the national identity of modern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> influence in the ancient world eventually would extend as far as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, where upper-class Athenians adopted aspects of the culture of the ruling class of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> as their own.

<br>In the 1970s, the last <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Shah</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_monarchs_of_Persia</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mohammad Reza Pahlavi</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi</b></span> identified his famous proclamation inscribed onto the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus Cylinder</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_Cylinder</b></span> as the oldest known declaration of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>human rights</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Human_rights</b></span>, and the Cylinder has since been popularized as such. This view has been criticized by some historians as a misunderstanding of the Cylinder's generic nature as a traditional statement that new monarchs make at the beginning of their reign.

<br>
<br>The name <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> is a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Latinized</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Latin</b></span> form derived from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_language</b></span> Κῦρος, Kỹros, itself from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Old Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Old_Persian</b></span> Kūruš.The name and its meaning has been recorded in ancient inscriptions in different languages. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ancient Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_language</b></span> historians <span style='color: blue'><b>Ctesias</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> noted that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> was named from Kuros, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sun</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ra</b></span>, a concept which has been interpreted as meaning "like the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sun</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ra</b></span>" (Khurvash) by noting its relation to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persian_language</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>noun</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Noun</b></span> for sun, khor, while using -vash as a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>suffix</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Suffix</b></span> of likeness. This may also point to a fascinating relationship to the mythological "first king" of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Jamshid</b></span>, whose name also incorporates the element "sun" ("shid").
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Karl Hoffmann</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Karl_Hoffmann_(linguist)</b></span> has suggested a translation based on the meaning of an Indo-European-root "to humiliate" and accordingly "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>" means "humiliator of the enemy in verbal contest". In the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian language</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persian_language</b></span> and especially in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>'s name is spelled .

<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> domination and kingdom in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iranian plateau</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iranian_Plateau</b></span> started by an extension of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenid dynasty</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, who expanded their earlier domination possibly from the 9th century BC onward. The eponymous founder of this dynasty was <span style='color: blue'><b>Achaemenes</b></span> (from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Old Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Old_Persian</b></span>). <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenids</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> are "descendants of <span style='color: blue'><b>Achaemenes</b></span>" as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> the Great, the ninth king of the dynasty, traces his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>genealogy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Genealogy</b></span> to him and declares "for this reason we are called <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenids</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>". <span style='color: blue'><b>Achaemenes</b></span> built the state Parsumash in the southwest of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span> and was succeeded by <span style='color: blue'><b>Teispes</b></span>, who took the title "King of <span style='color: blue'><b>Anshan</b></span>" after seizing <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Anshan city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anshan</b></span> and enlarging his kingdom further to include Pars proper. Ancient documents mention that <span style='color: blue'><b>Teispes</b></span> had a son called <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>, who also succeeded his father as "king of <span style='color: blue'><b>Anshan</b></span>". <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> had a full brother whose name is recorded as <span style='color: blue'><b>Ariaramnes</b></span>.
<br>
<br>In 600 BC, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> was succeeded by his son, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_I</b></span>, who reigned until 559 BC. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great was a son of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_I</b></span>, who named his son after his father, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> I.There are several inscriptions of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great and later kings that refer to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_I</b></span> as the "great king" and "king of <span style='color: blue'><b>Anshan</b></span>". Among these are some passages in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> cylinder where <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> calls himself "son of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_I</b></span>, great king, king of <span style='color: blue'><b>Anshan</b></span>". Another inscription (from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>CM</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Order_of_Canada</b></span>'s) mentions <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_I</b></span> as "mighty king" and "an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>", which according to the bulk of scholarly opinion was engraved under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> and considered as a later forgery by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>. However <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span>'s maternal grandfather Pharnaspes is named by <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> as "an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>" too.Xenophon's account in Cyropædia further names <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span>'s wife as Mandane and mentions <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span> as king of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span> (ancient <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>). These agree with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s own inscriptions, as <span style='color: blue'><b>Anshan</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Parsa</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persepolis</b></span> were different names of the same land. These also agree with other non-Iranian accounts, except at one point from <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> stating that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span> was not a king but a "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> of good family". However, in some other passages, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s account is wrong also on the name of the son of Chishpish, which he mentions as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span> but, according to modern scholars, should be <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The traditional view based on archaeological research and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>genealogy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Genealogy</b></span> given in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Behistun Inscription</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Behistun_Inscription</b></span> and by <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> holds that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great was an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. However it has been suggested by M. Waters that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> is unrelated to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenids</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> the Great and that his family was of Teispid and Anshanite origin instead of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> was born to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_I</b></span>, King of <span style='color: blue'><b>Anshan</b></span> and Mandane, daughter of <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>, King of Media during the period of 600–599 BC.
<br>
<br>By his own account, generally believed now to be accurate, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> was preceded as king by his father <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_I</b></span>, grandfather <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>, and great-grandfather. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> married <span style='color: blue'><b>Cassandane</b></span> who was an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> and the daughter of Pharnaspes who bore him two sons, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Bardiya</b></span> along with three daughters, <span style='color: blue'><b>Atossa</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Artystone</b></span>, and Roxane.Cyrus I and <span style='color: blue'><b>Cassandane</b></span> were known to love each other very much – <span style='color: blue'><b>Cassandane</b></span> said that she found it more bitter to leave <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> than to depart her life. After her death, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> insisted on public mourning throughout the kingdom.The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Nabonidus Chronicle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nabonidus_Chronicle</b></span> states that <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylonia</b></span> mourned <span style='color: blue'><b>Cassandane</b></span> for six days (identified from 21–26 March 538 BC).After his father's death, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> inherited the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian throne</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persian_Empire</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Pasargadae</b></span> which was a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vassal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vassal</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>. It is also noted that <span style='color: blue'><b>Strabo</b></span> has said that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> was originally named Agradates by his step-parents; therefore, it is probable that, when reuniting with his original family, following the naming customs, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s father, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_I</b></span>, named him <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> after his grandfather, who was <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> gave a mythological account of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s early life. In this account, <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> had two prophetic dreams in which a flood, and then a series of fruit bearing vines, emerged from his daughter Mandane's <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pelvis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pelvis</b></span>, and covered the entire kingdom. These were interpreted by his advisers as a foretelling that his grandson would one day rebel and supplant him as king. <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> summoned Mandane, at the time pregnant with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>, back to <span style='color: blue'><b>Ecbatana</b></span> to have the child killed. <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> delegated the task to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mithradates</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mithridates_VI_of_Pontus</b></span>, one of the shepherds of <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>, who raised the child and passed off his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>stillborn</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Stillbirth</b></span> son to <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> as the dead infant <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> I.Cyrus I lived in secrecy, but when he reached the age of 10, during a childhood game, he had the son of a nobleman beaten when he refused to obey <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s commands. As it was unheard of for the son of a shepherd to commit such an act, <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> had the boy brought to his court, and interviewed him and his adopted father. Upon the shepherd's <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>confession</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Confession</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> sent <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> back to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> to live with his biological parents.However, <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> summoned the son of <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span>, and in retribution, chopped him to pieces, roasted some portions while boiling others, and tricked his adviser into eating his child during a large banquet. Following the meal, <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>' servants brought <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> the head, hands and feet of his son on platters, so he could realize his inadvertent cannibalism.In another version, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> was presented as the son of a poor family that worked in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> court.
<br>
<br>Though his father died in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>551 BC</span> <span style='color: green'><b>551_BC</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great had already succeeded to the throne in 559 BC; however, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> was not yet an independent ruler. Like his predecessors, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> had to recognize <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> overlordship. <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>, last king of the Median Empire and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>' grandfather, may have ruled over the majority of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ancient Near East</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Near_East</b></span>, from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>frontier</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Frontier</b></span> in the west to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Parthians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Parthia</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> in the east.
<br>
<br>According to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Nabonidus Chronicle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nabonidus_Chronicle</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> launched an attack against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>, "king of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ansan</b></span>." According to the historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, it is known that <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> placed <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> in command of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> army to conquer <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>. However, <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> contacted <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> and encouraged his revolt against Media, before eventually defecting along with several of the nobility and a portion of the army. This <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mutiny</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mutiny</b></span> is confirmed by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Nabonidus Chronicle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nabonidus_Chronicle</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylon</b></span> texts suggest that the hostilities lasted for at least three years (553–550), and the final battle resulted in the capture of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ecbatana</b></span>. According to the historians <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Ctesias</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> spared the life of <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> and married his daughter, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Amytis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Amytis_of_Media</b></span>. This marriage pacified several vassals, including the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bactrians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bactria</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Parthians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Parthia</b></span>, and Saka.Herodotus notes that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> also subdued and incorporated <span style='color: blue'><b>Sogdia</b></span> into the empire during his military campaigns of 546–539 BC.
<br>
<br>With <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> out of power, all of his vassals (including many of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s relatives) were now under his command. His uncle <span style='color: blue'><b>Arsames</b></span>, who had been the king of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city-state</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City-state</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Parsa</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persepolis</b></span> under the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>, therefore would have had to give up his throne. However, this transfer of power within the family seems to have been smooth, and it is likely that <span style='color: blue'><b>Arsames</b></span> was still the nominal governor of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Parsa</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persepolis</b></span> under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s authority—more a <span style='color: blue'><b>Prince</b></span> or a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Grand Duke</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Grand_duke</b></span> than a King. His son, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hystaspes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vishtaspa</b></span>, who was also <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s second cousin, was then made <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Parthia</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Phrygia</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great thus united the twin <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achamenid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> kingdoms of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Parsa</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persepolis</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Anshan</b></span> into <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> proper. <span style='color: blue'><b>Arsames</b></span> lived to see his grandson become <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> the Great, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Shahanshah</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_monarchs_of_Persia</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, after the deaths of both of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s sons. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s conquest of Media was merely the start of his wars.
<br>
<br>The exact dates of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> conquest are unknown, but it must have taken place between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s overthrow of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> kingdom (550 BC) and his conquest of <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span> (539 BC). It was common in the past to give 547 BC as the year of the conquest due to some interpretations of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Nabonidus Chronicle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nabonidus_Chronicle</b></span>, but this position is currently not much held.The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> first attacked the Achaemenid <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span>'s <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of Pteria in <span style='color: blue'><b>Cappadocia</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span> besieged and captured the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> enslaving its inhabitants. Meanwhile, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invited the citizens of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> who were part of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian kingdom</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> to revolt against their ruler. The offer was rebuffed, and thus <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> levied an army and marched against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span>, increasing his numbers while passing through nations in his way. The Battle of Pteria was effectively a stalemate, with both sides suffering heavy casualties by nightfall. <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span> retreated to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> the following morning.
<br>
<br>While in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span> sent out requests for his allies to send aid to <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span>. However, near the end of the winter, before the allies could unite, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great pushed the war into <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> territory and besieged <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span> in his capital, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>. Shortly before the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>final Battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>ROH_Final_Battle</b></span> of Thymbra between the two rulers, <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> advised <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great to place his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dromedaries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dromedary</b></span> in front of his warriors; the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> horses, not used to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dromedaries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dromedary</b></span>' smell, would be very afraid. The strategy worked; the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> was routed. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> defeated and captured <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> occupied the capital at <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>, conquering the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian kingdom</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> in 546 BC.According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great spared <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span>'s life and kept him as an advisor, but this account conflicts with some translations of the contemporary <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Nabonidus Chronicle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nabonidus_Chronicle</b></span> (the King who was himself subdued by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great after conquest of <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylonia</b></span>), which interpret that the king of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span> was slain.
<br>
<br>Before returning to the capital, a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> named <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pactyas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pactyes</b></span> was entrusted by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great to send <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span>'s treasury to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. However, soon after <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s departure, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pactyas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pactyes</b></span> hired <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mercenaries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mercenary</b></span> and caused an uprising in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>, revolting against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Tabalus</b></span>. With recommendations from <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span> that he should turn the minds of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> people to luxury, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> sent <span style='color: blue'><b>Mazares</b></span>, one of his commanders, to subdue the insurrection but demanded that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pactyas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pactyes</b></span> be returned alive. Upon <span style='color: blue'><b>Mazares</b></span>'s arrival, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pactyas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pactyes</b></span> fled to <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>, where he had hired more <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mercenaries</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mercenary</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Mazares</b></span> marched his troops into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> country and subdued the cities of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Magnesia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Magnesia_on_the_Maeander</b></span> and Priene. The end of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pactyas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pactyes</b></span> is unknown, but after capture, he was probably sent to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> and put to death after a succession of tortures.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Mazares</b></span> continued the conquest of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> but died of unknown causes during his campaign in <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> sent <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> to complete <span style='color: blue'><b>Mazares</b></span>'s conquest of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> captured <span style='color: blue'><b>Lycia</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Cilicia</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Phoenicia</b></span>, using the technique of building <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>earthworks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span> to breach the walls of besieged cities, a method unknown to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. He ended his conquest of the area in 542 BC and returned to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.
<br>
<br>By the year 540 BC, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> captured <span style='color: blue'><b>Elam</b></span> (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Susiana</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Elam</b></span>) and its capital, Susa.The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Nabonidus Chronicle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nabonidus_Chronicle</b></span> records that, prior to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>(s), <span style='color: blue'><b>Nabonidus</b></span> had ordered cult statues from outlying <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylon</b></span> cities to be brought into the capital, suggesting that the conflict had begun possibly in the winter of 540 BC.Near the beginning of October 539 BC, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> fought the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Opis</b></span> in or near the strategic riverside <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Opis</b></span> on the <span style='color: blue'><b>Tigris</b></span>, north of <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylon</b></span> army was routed, and on October 10, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sippar</b></span> was seized without a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, with little to no resistance from the populace. It is probable that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> engaged in negotiations with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylon</b></span> generals to obtain a compromise on their part and therefore avoid an armed confrontation. <span style='color: blue'><b>Nabonidus</b></span> was staying in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> at the time and soon fled to the capital, <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span>, which he had not visited in years.

<br>Two days later, on October 12 (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>proleptic Gregorian calendar</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gregorian_calendar</b></span>), <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Gubaru</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gobryas</b></span>'s troops entered <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span>, again without any resistance from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylon</b></span> armies, and detained <span style='color: blue'><b>Nabonidus</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> explains that to accomplish this feat, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, using a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>basin</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Drainage_basin</b></span> dug earlier by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylon</b></span> queen <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Nitokris</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nitocris</b></span> to protect <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span> against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> attacks, diverted the <span style='color: blue'><b>Euphrates</b></span> river into a canal so that the water level dropped "to the height of the middle of a man's thigh", which allowed the invading forces to march directly through the river bed to enter at night.On October 29, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> himself entered the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span> and detained <span style='color: blue'><b>Nabonidus</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Prior to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s invasion of <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span>, the Neo-Babylonian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> had conquered many kingdoms. In addition to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Neo-Babylonian_Empire</b></span> itself, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> probably incorporated its <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>subnational entities</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Administrative_division</b></span> into his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span>, including <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Syria</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Eber-Nari</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Judea</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Arabia Petraea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Arabia_Petraea</b></span>, although there is no direct evidence of this fact.
<br>
<br>After taking <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great proclaimed himself "king of <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span>, king of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sumer</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Akkad</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Akkadian_Empire</b></span>, king of the four corners of the world" in the famous <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus Cylinder</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_Cylinder</b></span>, an inscription deposited in the foundations of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Esagila</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Temple</b></span> dedicated to the chief <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylon</b></span> god, <span style='color: blue'><b>Marduk</b></span>. The text of the cylinder denounces <span style='color: blue'><b>Nabonidus</b></span> as impious and portrays the victorious <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> pleasing the god <span style='color: blue'><b>Marduk</b></span>. It describes how <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> had improved the lives of the citizens of <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylonia</b></span>, repatriated displaced peoples and restored temples and cult sanctuaries. Although some have asserted that the cylinder represents a form of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>human rights</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Human_rights</b></span> charter, historians generally portray it in the context of a long-standing <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mesopotamian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mesopotamia</b></span> tradition of new rulers beginning their reigns with declarations of reforms.
<br>
<br>
<br>The Achaemenid <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span> under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s rule. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> became the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>largest empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_largest_empires</b></span> the world had yet seen.
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great's dominions comprised the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>largest empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_largest_empires</b></span> the world had ever seen. At the end of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>' rule, the Achaemenid <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span> stretched from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> in the west to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Indus River</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Indus_River</b></span> in the east.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The details</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Details</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s death vary by account. The account of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> from his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span> provides the second-longest detail, in which <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> met his fate in a fierce <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> with the <span style='color: blue'><b>Massagetae</b></span>, a tribe from the southern deserts of <span style='color: blue'><b>Khwarezm</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Kyzyl Kum</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kyzylkum_Desert</b></span> in the southernmost portion of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>steppe</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Steppe</b></span> regions of modern-day <span style='color: blue'><b>Kazakhstan</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Uzbekistan</b></span>, following the advice of <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span> to attack them in their own territory. The <span style='color: blue'><b>Massagetae</b></span> were related to the <span style='color: blue'><b>Scythians</b></span> in their dress and mode of living; they fought on horseback and on foot. In order to acquire her realm, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> first sent an offer of marriage to their ruler, the empress <span style='color: blue'><b>Tomyris</b></span>, a proposal she rejected.
<br>
<br>He then commenced his attempt to take <span style='color: blue'><b>Massagetae</b></span> territory by force (ca. 529),beginning by building bridges and towered war boats along his side of the river <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Jaxartes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Syr_Darya</b></span>, or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Syr Darya</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Syr_Darya</b></span>, which separated them. Sending him a warning to cease his encroachment (a warning which she stated she expected he would disregard anyway), <span style='color: blue'><b>Tomyris</b></span> challenged him to meet her forces in honorable warfare, inviting him to a location in her country a day's march from the river, where their two armies would formally engage each other. He accepted her offer, but, learning that the <span style='color: blue'><b>Massagetae</b></span> were unfamiliar with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>wine</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Wine</b></span> and its intoxicating effects, he set up and then left camp with plenty of it behind, taking his best soldiers with him and leaving the least capable ones. The general of <span style='color: blue'><b>Tomyris</b></span>'s army, <span style='color: blue'><b>Spargapises</b></span>, who was also her son, and a third of the Massagetian troops, killed the group <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> had left there and, finding the camp well stocked with food and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>wine</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Wine</b></span>, unwittingly drank themselves into inebriation, diminishing their capability to defend themselves when they were then overtaken by a surprise attack. They were successfully defeated, and, although he was taken prisoner, <span style='color: blue'><b>Spargapises</b></span> committed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>suicide</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Suicide</b></span> once he regained sobriety. Upon learning of what had transpired, <span style='color: blue'><b>Tomyris</b></span> denounced <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s tactics as underhanded and swore vengeance, leading a second wave of troops into <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> herself. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great was ultimately killed, and his forces suffered massive casualties in what <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> referred to as the fiercest <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> of his career and the ancient world. When it was over, <span style='color: blue'><b>Tomyris</b></span> ordered the body of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> brought to her, then decapitated him and dipped his head in a vessel of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>blood</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Blood</b></span> in a symbolic gesture of revenge for his bloodlust and the death of her son. However, some scholars question this version, mostly because <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> admits this event was one of many versions of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s death that he heard from a supposedly reliable source who told him no one was there to see the aftermath.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> also recounts that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> saw in his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sleep</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sleep</b></span> the oldest son of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hystaspes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vishtaspa</b></span> (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>) with wings upon his shoulders, shadowing with the one wing <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>, and with the other wing Europe.Archaeologist <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sir Max Mallowan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Max_Mallowan</b></span><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Max Mallowan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Max_Mallowan</b></span>is statement by <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> and its connection with the four winged <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>bas-relief</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Relief</b></span> figure of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great in the following way:
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> therefore, as I surmise, may have known of the close connection between this type of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>winged figure</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Winged_Figure</b></span> and the image of Iranian majesty, which he associated with a dream prognosticating the king's death before his last, fatal campaign across the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Oxus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Amu_Darya</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Muhammad Dandamayev</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Muhammad_Dandamayev</b></span> says maybe <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> took back <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>' body from the <span style='color: blue'><b>Massagetae</b></span>, unlike what <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> claimed.
<br>
<br>According to the Chronicle of Michael the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Syrian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Syria</b></span> (1166–1199 AD) <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> was killed by his wife <span style='color: blue'><b>Tomyris</b></span>, queen of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Massagetae</b></span> (Maksata), in the 60th year of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Jewish</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Jews</b></span> captivity.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Ctesias</b></span>, in his Persica, has the longest account, which says <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> met his death while putting down resistance from the Derbices infantry, aided by other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Scythian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Scythians</b></span> archers and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>, plus Indians and their elephants. According to him, this event took place northeast of the headwaters of the Syr Darya.An alternative account from <span style='color: blue'><b>Xenophon</b></span>'s <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyropaedia</b></span> contradicts the others, claiming that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> died peaceably at his capital.The final version of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s death comes from <span style='color: blue'><b>Berossus</b></span>, who only reports that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> met his death while warring against the <span style='color: blue'><b>Dahae</b></span> archers northwest of the headwaters of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Syr Darya</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Syr_Darya</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great's remains may have been interred in his capital <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Pasargadae</b></span>, where today a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>limestone</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Limestone</b></span> tomb (built around 540–530 BC) still exists, which many believe to be his. <span style='color: blue'><b>Strabo</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Arrian</b></span> give nearly identical descriptions of the tomb, based on the eyewitness report of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aristobulus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aristobulus_of_Cassandreia</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Cassandreia</b></span>, who at the request of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> visited the tomb two times.Though the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> itself is now in ruins, the burial place of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great has remained largely intact; and the tomb has been partially restored to counter its natural deterioration over the centuries. According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>, his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>epitaph</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Epitaph</b></span> said,
<br>
<br>O man, whoever you are and wherever you come from, for I know you will come, I am <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> who won the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> their empire. Do not therefore begrudge me this bit of earth that covers my bones.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cuneiform</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cuneiform_script</b></span> evidence from <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span> proves that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> died around December 530 BC, and that his son <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span> had become king. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_II</b></span> continued his father's policy of expansion, and captured <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> for the <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span>, but soon died after only seven years of rule. He was succeeded either by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s other son <span style='color: blue'><b>Bardiya</b></span> or an impostor posing as <span style='color: blue'><b>Bardiya</b></span>, who became the sole ruler of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> for seven months, until he was killed by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> the Great.
<br>
<br>The translated ancient Roman and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> accounts give a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vivid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vivid_(band)</b></span> description of the tomb both geometrically and aesthetically; The tomb's geometric shape has changed little over the years, still maintaining a large stone of quadrangular form at the base, followed by a pyramidal succession of smaller rectangular stones, until after a few slabs, the structure is curtailed by an edifice, with an arched roof composed of a pyramidal shaped stone, and a small opening or window on the side, where the slenderest man could barely squeeze through.
<br>
<br>Within this edifice was a golden coffin, resting on a table with golden supports, inside of which the body of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great was interred. Upon his resting place, was a covering of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tapestry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tapestry</b></span> and drapes made from the best available <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylon</b></span> materials, utilizing fine <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> worksmanship; below his bed was a fine <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>red carpet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Red_carpet</b></span>, covering the narrow rectangular area of his tomb.Translated <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> accounts describe the tomb as having been placed in the fertile <span style='color: blue'><b>Pasargadae</b></span> gardens, surrounded by trees and ornamental shrubs, with a group of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> protectors called the "<span style='color: blue'><b>Magi</b></span>", stationed nearby to protect the edifice from theft or damage.
<br>
<br>Years later, in the chaos created by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span>'s invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> and after the defeat of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius III</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_III</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great's tomb was broken into and most of its luxuries were looted. When <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> reached the tomb, he was horrified by the manner in which the tomb was treated, and questioned the <span style='color: blue'><b>Magi</b></span> and put them to court.On some accounts, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span>'s decision to put the <span style='color: blue'><b>Magi</b></span> on trial was more about his attempt to undermine their influence and his show of power in his newly conquered empire, than a concern for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s tomb.However, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> admired <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>, from an early age reading <span style='color: blue'><b>Xenophon</b></span>'s <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyropaedia</b></span>, which described <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s heroism in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> and governance as a king and legislator.Regardless, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> ordered <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aristobulus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aristobulus_of_Cassandreia</b></span> to improve the tomb's condition and restore its interior.Despite his admiration for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great, and his attempts at renovation of his tomb, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> had, six years previously (330 BC), sacked <span style='color: blue'><b>Persepolis</b></span>, the opulent <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> may have chosen the site for, and either ordered its burning as an act of pro-Greek <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>propaganda</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Propaganda</b></span> or set it on fire during drunken revels.
<br>
<br>The edifice has survived the test of time, through invasions, internal divisions, successive empires, regime changes and revolutions. The last prominent <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> figure to bring attention to the tomb was <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mohammad Reza Pahlavi</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi</b></span> (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Shah</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_monarchs_of_Persia</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span>) the last official monarch of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, during his celebrations of 2,500 years of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>monarchy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Monarchy</b></span>. Just as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> before him, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Shah</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_monarchs_of_Persia</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span> wanted to appeal to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s legacy to legitimize his own rule by extension.United Nations recognizes the tomb of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great and <span style='color: blue'><b>Pasargadae</b></span> as a UNESCO <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>World Heritage site</span> <span style='color: green'><b>World_Heritage_Site</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great is said in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bible</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hebrew_Bible</b></span> to have liberated the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Jews</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persian_Jews</b></span> from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian captivity</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylonian_captivity</b></span> to resettle and rebuild <span style='color: blue'><b>Jerusalem</b></span>, earning him an honored place in <span style='color: blue'><b>Judaism</b></span>.
<br>British historian Charles Freeman suggests that "In scope and extent his achievements <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> ranked far above that of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Macedonians</b></span> king, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span>, who was to demolish the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenid</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> empire in the 320s but fail to provide any stable alternative." <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> has been a personal hero to many people, including <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thomas Jefferson</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thomas_Jefferson</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mohammad Reza Pahlavi</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>David Ben-Gurion</span> <span style='color: green'><b>David_Ben-Gurion</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The achievements of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great throughout <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>antiquity</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_antiquity</b></span> are reflected in the way he is remembered today. His own nation, the Iranians, have regarded him as "The Father", the very title that had been used during the time of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> himself, by the many nations that he conquered, as according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Xenophon</b></span>:
<br>
<br>And those who were subject to him, he treated with esteem and regard, as if they were his own children, while his subjects themselves respected <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> as their "Father" ... What other man but '<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>', after having overturned an empire, ever died with the title of "The Father" from the people whom he had brought under his power? For it is <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Plain</b></span> fact that this is a name for one that bestows, rather than for one that takes away!
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylonia</b></span> regarded him as "The Liberator".
<br>
<br>The Book of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ezra</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Book_of_Ezra</b></span> narrates a story of the first return of exiles in the first year of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>, in which <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> boastfully proclaims: "All the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>God</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Names_of_God_in_Judaism</b></span> of heaven, given me; and He hath charged me to build Him a house in <span style='color: blue'><b>Jerusalem</b></span>, which is in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Judah</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kingdom_of_Judah</b></span>."(<span style='color: blue'><b>Ezra</b></span> 1:2)
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> was distinguished equally as a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>statesman</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Scholar-official</b></span> and as a soldier. Due in part to the political infrastructure he created, the Achaemenid <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span> endured long after his death.
<br>
<br>The rise of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s rule had a profound impact on the course of world history. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iranian philosophy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iranian_philosophy</b></span>, literature and religion all played dominant roles in world events for the next millennium. Despite the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Islamic conquest</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Muslim_conquest_of_Persia</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> in the 7th century AD by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Islamic Caliphate</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Caliphate</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> continued to exercise enormous influence in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Middle East</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Middle_East</b></span> during the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Islamic Golden Age</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Islamic_Golden_Age</b></span>, and was particularly instrumental in the growth and expansion of Islam.
<br>
<br>Many of the Iranian dynasties following the Achaemenid <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span> and their kings saw themselves as the heirs to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great and have claimed to continue the line begun by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> I.However, there are different opinions among scholars whether this is also the case for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sassanid Dynasty</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sasanian_Empire</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> was himself infatuated with and admired <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great, from an early age reading <span style='color: blue'><b>Xenophon</b></span>'s <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyropaedia</b></span>, which described <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s heroism in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medieval_warfare</b></span> and governance and his abilities as a king and a legislator.During his visit to <span style='color: blue'><b>Pasargadae</b></span> he ordered <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aristobulus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aristobulus_of_Cassandreia</b></span> to decorate the interior of the sepulchral <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>chamber</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chamber_tomb</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s tomb.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s legacy has been felt even as far away as <span style='color: blue'><b>Iceland</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>colonial America</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thirteen_Colonies</b></span>. Many of the thinkers and rulers of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Classical Antiquity</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_antiquity</b></span> as well as the <span style='color: blue'><b>Renaissance</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Enlightenment era</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Age_of_Enlightenment</b></span>, and the forefathers of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>United States</span> <span style='color: green'><b>United_States</b></span> of America sought inspiration from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great through works such as <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyropaedia</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thomas Jefferson</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thomas_Jefferson</b></span>, for example, owned two copies of <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyropaedia</b></span>, one with parallel <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Latin</b></span> translations on facing pages showing substantial <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Jefferson</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thomas_Jefferson</b></span> markings that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>signify</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Signify</b></span> the amount of influence the book has had on drafting the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>United States</span> <span style='color: green'><b>United_States</b></span> Declaration of Independence.
<br>
<br>According to Professor <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Richard Nelson Frye</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Richard_N._Frye</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> – whose abilities as conqueror and administrator Frye says are attested by the longevity and vigor of the Achaemenid <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span> – held an almost mythic role among the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian people</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persian_people</b></span> "similar to that of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Romulus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Romulus_and_Remus</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Remus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Romulus_and_Remus</b></span> in Rome or <span style='color: blue'><b>Moses</b></span> for the <span style='color: blue'><b>Israelites</b></span>", with a story that "follows in many details the stories of hero and conquerors from elsewhere in the ancient world". Frye writes, "He became the epitome of the great qualities expected of a ruler in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>antiquity</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_antiquity</b></span>, and he assumed heroic features as a conqueror who was tolerant and magnanimous as well as brave and daring. His personality as seen by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> influenced them and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span>, and, as the tradition was transmitted by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Romans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Rome</b></span>, may be considered to influence our thinking even now."
<br>
<br>On another account, Professor <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Patrick</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Saint_Patrick</b></span> Hunt states, "If you are looking at the greatest personages in History who have affected the World, '<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great' is one of the few who deserves that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>epithet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Epithet</b></span>, the one who deserves to be called 'the Great'. The empire over which <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> ruled was the largest the Ancient World had ever seen and may be to this day the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>largest empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_largest_empires</b></span> ever."
<br>
<br>Main articles: <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great in the <span style='color: blue'><b>Bible</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great in the <span style='color: blue'><b>Quran</b></span>
<br>Though it is generally believed that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zarathushtra</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Zoroaster</b></span>'s teachings maintained influence on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s acts and policies, so far no clear evidence has been found to indicate that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> practiced a specific religion. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pierre Briant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pierre_Briant</b></span> wrote that given the poor information we have, "it seems quite reckless to try to reconstruct what the religion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> might have been." His views are believed expressed in the content of the Cylinder:
<br>
<br>The policies of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> with respect to treatment of minority religions are well documented in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylon</b></span> texts as well as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Jewish</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Judaism</b></span> sources and the historians accounts. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> had a general policy of religious tolerance throughout his vast empire. Whether this was a new policy or the continuation of policies followed by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Neo-Babylonian_Empire</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyrians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Assyria</b></span> (as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lester</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Buy_More</b></span> Grabbe maintains)is disputed. He brought peace to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Neo-Babylonian_Empire</b></span> and is said to have kept his army away from the temples and restored the statues of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylon</b></span> gods to their sanctuaries.
<br>
<br>His treatment of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Jews</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Judaism</b></span> during their exile in <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span> after <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Nebuchadnezzar II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nebuchadnezzar_II</b></span> destroyed <span style='color: blue'><b>Jerusalem</b></span> is reported in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bible</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hebrew_Bible</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Jewish Bible</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hebrew_Bible</b></span>'s <span style='color: blue'><b>Ketuvim</b></span> ends in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Second Chronicles</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Books_of_Chronicles</b></span> with the decree of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>, which returned the exiles to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Promised Land</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Land_of_Israel</b></span> from <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span> along with a commission to rebuild the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Temple</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Thus saith <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>, king of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>: All the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD, the <span style='color: blue'><b>God</b></span> of heaven given me; and He hath charged me to build Him a house in <span style='color: blue'><b>Jerusalem</b></span>, which is in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Judah</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kingdom_of_Judah</b></span>. Whosoever there is among you of all His people – the LORD, his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>God</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Names_of_God_in_Judaism</b></span>, be with him – let him go there. 
<br>
<br>This edict is also fully reproduced in the Book of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ezra</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Book_of_Ezra</b></span>.
<br>
<br>In the first year of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>King Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>e king issued a decree: "Concerning the house of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>God</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Names_of_God_in_Judaism</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Jerusalem</b></span>, let the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Temple</b></span>, the place where sacrifices are offered, be rebuilt and let its foundations be retained, its height being 60 cubits and its width 60 cubits; with three layers of huge stones and one layer of timbers. And let the cost be paid from the royal treasury. Also let the gold and silver utensils of the house of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>God</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Names_of_God_in_Judaism</b></span>, which <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Nebuchadnezzar II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nebuchadnezzar_II</b></span> took from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Temple</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Jerusalem</b></span> and brought to <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span>, be returned and brought to their places in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Temple</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Jerusalem</b></span>; and you shall put them in the house of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>God</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Names_of_God_in_Judaism</b></span>." — 
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Jews</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Judaism</b></span> honored him as a dignified and righteous king. In one Biblical passage, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Isaiah</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Book_of_Isaiah</b></span> refers to him as <span style='color: blue'><b>Messiah</b></span> (lit. "His anointed one") (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Isaiah</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Book_of_Isaiah</b></span> 45:1), making him the only <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>gentile</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gentile</b></span> to be so referred. Elsewhere in <span style='color: blue'><b>Isaiah</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>God</span> <span style='color: green'><b>God_in_Judaism</b></span> is described as saying, "I will raise up <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> in my righteousness: I will make all his ways straight. He will rebuild my <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> and set my exiles free, but not for a price or reward, says <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>God</span> <span style='color: green'><b>God_in_Judaism</b></span> Almighty." (<span style='color: blue'><b>Isaiah</b></span> 45:13) As the text suggests, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> did ultimately release the nation of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Israel</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Israelites</b></span> from its exile without compensation or tribute. These particular passages (<span style='color: blue'><b>Isaiah</b></span> 40–55, often referred to as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Deutero-Isaiah</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Book_of_Isaiah</b></span>) are believed by most modern critical scholars to have been added by another author toward the end of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian exile</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylonian_captivity</b></span> (ca. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>536 BC</span> <span style='color: green'><b>536_BC</b></span>)
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Josephus</b></span>, the first-century <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Jewish</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Judaism</b></span> historian, relates the traditional view of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Jews</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Judaism</b></span> regarding the prediction of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Isaiah</b></span> in his Antiquities of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Jews</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Judaism</b></span>, book 11, chapter 1

<br>In the first year of the reign of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>, which was the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>seventieth</span> <span style='color: green'><b>70th_United_States_Congress</b></span> from the day that our people were removed out of their own land into <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>God</span> <span style='color: green'><b>God_in_Judaism</b></span> commiserated the captivity and calamity of these poor people, according as he had foretold to them by <span style='color: blue'><b>Jeremiah</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>prophet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Prophet</b></span>, before the destruction of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>, that after they had served <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Nebuchadnezzar II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nebuchadnezzar_II</b></span> and his posterity, and after they had undergone that servitude seventy years, he would restore them again to the land of their fathers, and they should build their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Temple</b></span>, and enjoy their ancient prosperity. And these things <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>God</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Names_of_God_in_Judaism</b></span> did afford them; for he stirred up the mind of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>, and made him write this throughout all <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>: "Thus saith <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the king: Since <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>God</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Names_of_God_in_Judaism</b></span> Almighty hath appointed me to be king of the habitable earth, I believe that he is that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>God</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Names_of_God_in_Judaism</b></span> which the nation of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Israelites</b></span> worship; for indeed he foretold my name by the prophets, and that I should build him a house at <span style='color: blue'><b>Jerusalem</b></span>, in the country of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Judea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kingdom_of_Judah</b></span>." This was known to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> by his reading the book which <span style='color: blue'><b>Isaiah</b></span> left behind him of his prophecies; for this <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>prophet</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Prophet</b></span> said that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>God</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Names_of_God_in_Judaism</b></span> had spoken thus to him in a secret vision: "My will is, that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>, whom I have appointed to be king over many and great nations, send back my people to their own land, and build my <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Temple</b></span>." This was foretold by <span style='color: blue'><b>Isaiah</b></span> one hundred and forty years before the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Temple</b></span> was demolished. Accordingly, when <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> read this, and admired the Divine power, an earnest desire and ambition seized upon him to fulfill what was so written; so he called for the most eminent <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Jews</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Judaism</b></span> that were in <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span>, and said to them, that he gave them leave to go back to their own country, and to rebuild their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Jerusalem</b></span>, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Temple</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>God</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Names_of_God_in_Judaism</b></span>, for that he would be their assistant, and that he would write to the rulers and governors that were in the neighborhood of their country of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Judea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kingdom_of_Judah</b></span>, that they should contribute to them gold and silver for the building of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Temple</b></span>, and besides that, beasts for their sacrifices.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> was praised in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tanakh</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hebrew_Bible</b></span> (<span style='color: blue'><b>Isaiah</b></span> 45:1–6 and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ezra</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Book_of_Ezra</b></span> 1:1–11) for the freeing of slaves, humanitarian equality and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>costly reparations</span> <span style='color: green'><b>World_War_I_reparations</b></span> he made. However, there was <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Jewish</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Jews</b></span> criticism of him after he was lied to by the Cuthites, who wanted to halt the building of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Second Temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Second_Temple</b></span>. They accused the <span style='color: blue'><b>Jews</b></span> of conspiring to rebel, so <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> in turn stopped the construction, which would not be completed until 515 BC, during the reign of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>. According to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bible</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hebrew_Bible</b></span> it was King <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ezra</b></span> who was convinced to stop the construction of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Temple</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Jerusalem</b></span>. (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ezra</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Book_of_Ezra</b></span> 4:7–24)
<br>
<br>The historical nature of this decree has been challenged. Professor <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lester</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Buy_More</b></span> L Grabbe argues that there was no decree but that there was a policy that allowed exiles to return to their homelands and rebuild their temples. He also argues that the archaeology suggests that the return was a "trickle", taking place over perhaps decades, resulting in a maximum population of perhaps 30,000.Philip R. Davies called the authenticity of the decree "dubious", citing Grabbe and adding that J. Briend argued against "the authenticity of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ezra</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Book_of_Ezra</b></span> 1.1–4 is J. Briend, in a paper given at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Institut Catholique de Paris</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Institut_Catholique_de_Paris</b></span> on 15 December 1993, who denies that it resembles the form of an official document but reflects rather biblical prophetic <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>idiom</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Idiom</b></span>."Mary Joan Winn <span style='color: blue'><b>Leith</b></span> believes that the decree in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ezra</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Book_of_Ezra</b></span> might be authentic and along with the Cylinder that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>, like earlier rules, was through these decrees trying to gain support from those who might be strategically important, particularly those close to <span style='color: blue'><b>Egypt</b></span> which he wished to conquer. He also wrote that "appeals to <span style='color: blue'><b>Marduk</b></span> in the cylinder and to <span style='color: blue'><b>Yahweh</b></span> in the biblical decree demonstrate the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Persian_language</b></span> tendency to co-opt local religious and political traditions in the interest of imperial control."
<br>
<br>Some contemporary <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Muslim</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Islam</b></span> scholars have suggested that the Qur'anic figure of <span style='color: blue'><b>Dhul-Qarnayn</b></span> is a mythological representation of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great. <span style='color: blue'><b>Dhul-Qarnayn</b></span>,, or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Zulqarnayn</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dhul-Qarnayn</b></span>, "he of the two horns" (or figuratively "he of the two ages"), appears in <span style='color: blue'><b>Surah</b></span> 18 verses 83-101 of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Quran</b></span> as a figure empowered by Allah to erect a wall between mankind and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Gog</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gog_and_Magog</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Magog</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gog_and_Magog</b></span>, the representation of chaos This theory was proposed by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sunni</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sunni_Islam</b></span> scholars such as Maulana Maududi and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Abul Kalam Azad</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Abul_Kalam_Azad</b></span> and endorsed by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Shi'a</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Shia_Islam</b></span> scholars Allameh <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tabatabaei</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Muhammad_Husayn_Tabataba'i</b></span>, in his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tafsir al-Mizan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tafsir_al-Mizan</b></span> and Makarem Shirazi.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> founded the empire as a multi-state empire governed by four capital states; <span style='color: blue'><b>Pasargadae</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Ecbatana</b></span>. He allowed a certain amount of regional autonomy in each state, in the form of a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrapy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> system. A <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrapy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> was an administrative unit, usually organized on a geographical basis. A '<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span>' (governor) was the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vassal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vassal</b></span> king, who administered the region, a 'general' supervised military recruitment and ensured order, and a 'state secretary' kept the official records. The general and the state secretary reported directly to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> as well as the central government.
<br>
<br>During his reign, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> maintained control over a vast region of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>conquered kingdoms</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Conquered_Kingdoms</b></span>, achieved through retaining and expanding the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrapies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span>. Further organization of newly conquered territories into provinces ruled by satraps, was continued by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s successor <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> the Great. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s empire was based on tribute and conscripts from the many parts of his realm.
<br>
<br>Through his military savvy, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> created an organized army including the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Immortals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Immortality</b></span> unit, consisting of 10,000 highly trained soldiers.He also formed an innovative <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>postal system</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chapar_Khaneh</b></span> throughout the empire, based on several relay stations called <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chapar Khaneh</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chapar_Khaneh</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s conquests began a new era in the age of empire building, where a vast superstate, comprising many dozens of countries, races, religions, and languages, were ruled under a single administration headed by a central government. This system lasted for centuries, and was retained both by the invading <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Seleucid dynasty</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Seleucid_Empire</b></span> during their control of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, and later Iranian dynasties including the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Parthians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Parthian_Empire</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sasanians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sasanian_Empire</b></span>.
<br>
<br>I am an Iranian, a descendant of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great. This emperor proclaimed at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pinnacle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pinnacle</b></span> of power 2,500 years ago that he "would not reign over the people if they did not wish it". He promised not to force any person to change his religion and faith and guaranteed freedom for all. The Charter of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> the Great should be studied in the history of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>human rights</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Human_rights</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> has been known for his innovations in building projects; he further developed the technologies that he found in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>conquered cultures</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Periodization_of_pre-Columbian_Peru</b></span> and applied them in building the palaces of <span style='color: blue'><b>Pasargadae</b></span>. He was also famous for his love of gardens; the recent excavations in his capital <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> has revealed the existence of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Pasargadae</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> Garden and a network of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>irrigation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Irrigation</b></span> canals. <span style='color: blue'><b>Pasargadae</b></span> was a place for two magnificent palaces surrounded by a majestic royal park and vast formal gardens; among them was the four-quartered wall gardens of "Paradisia" with over 1000 meters of channels made out of carved <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>limestone</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Limestone</b></span>, designed to fill small basins at every 16 meters and water various types of wild and domestic <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>flora</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Flora</b></span>. The design and concept of Paradisia were exceptional and have been used as a model for many ancient and modern parks, ever since.

So nobly beautifying the hanging Gardens of <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span>, that he was also thought to be the author thereof."
<br>
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> cylinder, a contemporary <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cuneiform script</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cuneiform_script</b></span> proclaiming <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> as legitimate king of <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span>.
<br>One of the few surviving sources of information that can be dated directly to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s time is the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus Cylinder</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_Cylinder</b></span>, a document in the form of a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>clay</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Clay_tablet</b></span> cylinder inscribed in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Akkadian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Akkadian_language</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cuneiform</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cuneiform_script</b></span>. It had been placed in the foundations of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Esagila</b></span> (the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Temple</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Marduk</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span>) as a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>foundation deposit</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Foundation_deposit</b></span> following the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> conquest in 539 BC.

<br>
<br>The text of the cylinder denounces the deposed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylon</b></span> king <span style='color: blue'><b>Nabonidus</b></span> as impious and portrays <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> as pleasing to the chief god <span style='color: blue'><b>Marduk</b></span>. It describes how <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> had improved the lives of the citizens of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Neo-Babylonian_Empire</b></span>, repatriated displaced peoples and restored temples and cult sanctuaries.Although not mentioned specifically in the text, the repatriation of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Jews</b></span> from their "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian captivity</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylonian_captivity</b></span>" has been interpreted as part of this general policy.

<br>In the 1970s the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Shah</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_monarchs_of_Persia</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span> adopted the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span> cylinder as a political symbol, using it "as a central image in his celebration of 2500 years of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iranian monarchy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span>." and asserting that it was "the first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>human rights</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Human_rights</b></span> charter in history".This view has been disputed by some as "rather anachronistic" and tendentious,as the modern concept of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>human rights</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Human_rights</b></span> would have been quite alien to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s contemporaries and is not mentioned by the cylinder.The cylinder has, nonetheless, become seen as part of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span>'s cultural identity.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>United Nations</span> <span style='color: green'><b>United_Nations</b></span> has declared the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>relic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Relic</b></span> to be an "ancient declaration of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>human rights</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Human_rights</b></span>" since 1971, approved by then Secretary <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>General</span> <span style='color: green'><b>General_officer</b></span> Sithu <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>U Thant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>U_Thant</b></span>, after he "was given a replica by the sister of the Shah of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Iran</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Iran</b></span>". The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>British Museum</span> <span style='color: green'><b>British_Museum</b></span> describes the cylinder as "an instrument of ancient <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mesopotamian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mesopotamia</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>propaganda</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Propaganda</b></span>" that "reflects a long tradition in <span style='color: blue'><b>Mesopotamia</b></span> where, from as early as the third millennium BC, kings began their reigns with declarations of reforms. The cylinder emphasizes <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_I</b></span>'s continuity with previous <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylon</b></span> rulers, asserting his virtue as a traditional <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylon</b></span> king while denigrating his predecessor.

<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Neil MacGregor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Neil_MacGregor</b></span>, Director of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>British Museum</span> <span style='color: green'><b>British_Museum</b></span>, has stated that the cylinder was "the first attempt we know about running a society, a state with different nationalities and faiths — a new kind of statecraft." He explained that "It has even been described as the first declaration of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>human rights</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Human_rights</b></span>, and while this was never the intention of the document – the modern concept of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>human rights</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Human_rights</b></span>
