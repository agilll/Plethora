<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> (ruled 486-465 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>), also known as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> the Great, was the king of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> Achaemenid <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span>. His official title was <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Shahanshah</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_monarchs_of_Persia</b></span> which, though usually translated as `emperor’, actually means `king of kings’. He is identified as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ahasuerus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> in the biblical Book of <span style='color: blue'><b>Esther</b></span> (although his son, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia</b></span>, is also a possibility as is <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes II</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia</b></span>) and is referenced at length in the works of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Diodorus Siculus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Diodorus_Siculus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Quintus Curtius Rufus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Quintus_Curtius_Rufus</b></span>, and, to a lesser extent, in <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> is the primary source for the story of his expedition to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. The name `<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>’ is the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> version of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> `Khshayarsa’ (or Khashyar <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Shah</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_monarchs_of_Persia</b></span>), and so he is known in the west as `<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>’ but in the east as `Khshayarsa'.
<br>
<br>His mother was <span style='color: blue'><b>Atossa</b></span>, the daughter of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> (who founded the Achaemenid <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span>). He was, therefore, accepted as a great king before having to prove himself so in any way. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> is celebrated for his many building projects throughout his empire but is best known, in both ancient and modern sources, for the massive expedition he mounted against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> in 480 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> which, according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, assembled the largest and most well equipped fighting force ever put into the field up to that point. He was the son of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> the Great (550-486 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>) who, in an effort to punish <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> for their support of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> colonies' revolt against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule, had invaded <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> in 492 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> were defeated by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> forces at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> in 490 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> died in 486 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> before he could mount another offensive. It, therefore, fell to his son to carry out his father’s wishes and, in amassing an army of such size and strength, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> felt confident of his success in achieving what the great <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> had been unable to realize.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> was not the eldest of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>’ sons but, as the first-born of his marriage with <span style='color: blue'><b>Atossa</b></span>, was chosen as successor. Upon <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>’ death, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>’ older half-brother, Artabazenes, claimed the throne but was rebuffed because his mother was a commoner while <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>’ mother was the daughter of the great <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>. He married the princess <span style='color: blue'><b>Amestris</b></span>, daughter of <span style='color: blue'><b>Otanes</b></span>, who would become mother to his sons <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hystaspes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vishtaspa</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia</b></span>, Achamenes, and daughters <span style='color: blue'><b>Amytis</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Rhodogune</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Rhodogune_of_Parthia</b></span>.  Upon assuming the throne, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>’ <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Commander-in-Chief</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Commander-in-chief</b></span> of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Army</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> (who was also his cousin and brother-in-law), pressured him to renew the campaign against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>’ motives, it seems, were personal, as he hoped to rule the conquered nation as <span style='color: blue'><b>Satrap</b></span> following <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>’ victory. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>’ uncle and advisor, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artabanus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artabanus_of_Persia</b></span>, tried to persuade him to abandon the expedition but <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>’ arguments prevailed. Even so, there were many matters to attend to such as the insurrection of <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span> and the revolts against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> expended considerable time throughout the year 485 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> in quelling these and restoring order.
<br>
<br>Although his grandfather <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> had been a friend to <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> had subjugated the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> and melted down the golden statue of <span style='color: blue'><b>Marduk</b></span>, their patron deity. This was a particular <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>affront</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_civilisations_in_the_Culture_series</b></span> to the dignity and tradition of <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span> because one of the religious duties of a ruler was to grasp the hands of the statue of <span style='color: blue'><b>Marduk</b></span> at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>New Year</span> <span style='color: green'><b>New_Year</b></span>’s festival in order to ensure continued prosperity throughout the land; <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span> thus enjoyed a prestige among the cities of <span style='color: blue'><b>Mesopotamia</b></span> as the site of this ritual. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> had been diligent in officiating at the festival, as had <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>, but <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> considered it a matter of little consequence. He ignored the established relationships with former allies, referring to himself as the King of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>, and treated all as subject to his rule. <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span> revolted against him twice before he lay <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span> to it and crushed the rebellion.
<br>
<br>With relative peace established in his empire, he again turned his attention to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and conquest. He spent four years amassing enough supplies and weaponry for the campaign and also conscripting as many men as he could from various regions to ensure his victory. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> tells the story of Pythias the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> (a descendant of King <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span>) whose five sons were among those conscripted. Pythias hosted the king and his army lavishly at <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> in the winter of 481-480 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> and offered to give <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> a considerable sum of money for the campaign, but <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> refused his offer and, instead, rewarded Pythias for his generosity by adding greatly to his treasury.
<br>
<br>Prior to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>’ departure for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span>, a bad <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>omen</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Omen</b></span> in the form of an eclipse appeared in the sky but <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>, assured by his diviners that it meant nothing, proceeded with his plans. Pythias, however, recognized the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>omen</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Omen</b></span> as a warning of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>impending doom</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Impending_Doom_(American_band)</b></span> and, emboldened by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>’ generosity and kindness, asked if his eldest son could be released from the army so that he would have at least one son to care for him in his old age and carry on as heir. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> became enraged at this request as it meant that Pythias doubted his chances of success. He had the eldest son removed from the ranks, cut him in half, placed the two sections of the corpse on either side of the road, and marched his troops away between them.
<br>
<br>According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, the size of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>’ expeditionary force was over two million men and four thousand ships. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Diodorus Siculus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Diodorus_Siculus</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Quintus Curtius Rufus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Quintus_Curtius_Rufus</b></span> confirm the enormity of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>’ army, though their numbers differ from <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> and from each other. In order to move his ships freely, he had a canal dug across the Isthmus of Actium near Mr. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mount_Athos</b></span>, the remains of which are still visible in the present day. He assembled his forces to cross the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> into <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span> and, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> reports, watched them as they stood in formation. The size of the army and its majesty
<br>
<br>first gave <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> a feeling of deep self-satisfaction, but later he began to weep. When his uncle, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artabanus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artabanus_of_Persia</b></span> (the one who had at first freely expressed his opinion and advised <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> not to attack <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>) noticed that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> was crying he said, `My lord, a short while ago you were feeling happy with your situation and now you are weeping. What a total change of mood!’ `Yes,” <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> answered. `I was reflecting on things and it occurred to me how short the sum total of human life is, which made me feel compassion. Look at all these people – but not one of them will still be alive in a hundred years’ time’(VII<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>.45</span> <span style='color: green'><b>.45_ACP</b></span>-46).
<br>
<br>Even so, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> put the thoughts of the brevity of life from his mind and ordered the crossing and the invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The omens, from the start, were not favorable to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>’ cause. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> is said to have risen in revolt at his crossing. In order to move his massive force, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> built bridges across the water. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> writes:
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenicians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> who had been assigned the task set about building their bridges (the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenicians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span> using white <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>flax</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Flax</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>papyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Papyrus</b></span>), taking <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Abydus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Abydos_(Hellespont)</b></span> as their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>starting point</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Starting_Point</b></span> and directing their efforts towards the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>headland</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Headlands_and_bays</b></span> on the opposite coast – a distance of seven <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>stades</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Stadion_(unit)</b></span>. They had just finished bridging the straits when a violent storm erupted which completely smashed and destroyed everything. This news made <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> furious. He ordered his men to give the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> three hundred lashes and to sink a pair of shackles into the sea. I once heard that they also dispatched men to brand the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> as well. Be that as it may, he did tell the men he had thrashing the sea to revile it in terms you would never hear from a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. “Bitter water,” they said, this is your punishment for wronging your master when he did no wrong to you. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>King Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>cross you, with or without your consent. People are right not to sacrifice to a muddy, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>brackish</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Brackish_water</b></span> stream like you!” So the sea was punished at his orders and he had the supervisors of the bridging of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> beheaded. The men assigned this grotesque task carried out their orders and another team of engineers managed to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>bridge</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bridge</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> (VII.34-36).
<br>
<br>Once they had reached the other side, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> writes, “a really extraordinary thing happened: a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>horse</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span> gave birth to a hare. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> dismissed it as insignificant, though its meaning was transparent. It meant that, although <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> would walk tall and proud on his way to attack <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, he would return to his starting-point running for his life” (VII.57). Besides the revolt of the waters of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> and the appearance of the hare, there were other omens which indicated that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>’ campaign would end badly, but <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> dismissed all of them as meaningless and proceeded on toward his goal.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, in the meantime, had mobilized their forces under the direction of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and sent forces to meet the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> expedition and defend the mainland. The battles of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span>, fought more or less concurrently, provided the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> with victories (either complete or strategic) which enabled them access to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, and they marched on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> as soon as they were able. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> was so enraged at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> resistance to his wishes that he burned the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> in a furious fit, which he so regretted that, later, he would reference this as his only remorse in the entire campaign.
<br>
<br>At this point, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, who had abandoned <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and most of the countryside, had gathered their forces off the coast of the mainland at <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span> and in the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span> and their navy was anchored in the straits of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> called a war council to decide on his next move and whether to engage the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>, return home content with the destruction of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, or consider other alternatives. <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> counseled in favor of a sea <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, as did all the other allied leaders, except for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artemisia_I_of_Caria</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Caria</b></span> who provided <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> with other options. She claimed that he need do nothing to secure victory but keep the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> in place until their supplies ran out and they sued for peace. While he clearly respected <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artemisia_I_of_Caria</b></span> and thanked her for her advice, he chose the majority opinion and committed to the naval engagement.
<br>
<br>The Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>, which followed, was a disaster for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet and cost <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> dearly. Following the loss, he again consulted <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artemisia_I_of_Caria</b></span> for advice and she told him he should return home and accept <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>’ offer to remain behind and conquer the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>’ name. This time he accepted her counsel and left the country with <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> remaining behind to continue the war effort. <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> was defeated the following year at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Plataea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Plataea</b></span> which was fought on the same day as the equally decisive Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>, 27 August 479 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> was killed and, with his death, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> forces scattered and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>’ ambitions for subjugating <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> were crushed. As the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>omen</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Omen</b></span> had predicted, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> returned home `limping’ with a fraction of his army and was forced to eat <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>bark</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Barque</b></span>, weeds, and leaves because there was no food left in the regions they traveled through. The men were ravaged by disease and many died of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dysentery</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dysentery</b></span> and so, by the time <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> crossed back across the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> and reached <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>, he had hardly any army left to speak of.
<br>
<br>Back home, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> concentrated his efforts on making larger and grander monuments and completing greater building projects than his father. In doing so, he depleted the royal treasury to an even greater extent than his expedition to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> already had.  He maintained the roadways throughout the empire, especially the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Royal Road</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Royal_Road</b></span> by which messages were carried (the precursor to the Roman mail system and, later, the modern-day <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>postal system</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mail</b></span>) and devoted both time and funds to expanding sites such as <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Persepolis</b></span>. Although <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>’ palace still stood, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>’ commissioned an even more elaborate building project to raise his own opulent palace nearby and also commanded the construction of the Hall of a Hundred Columns and the building which has been designated `The <span style='color: blue'><b>Harem</b></span>’ by archaeologists (because of the duplication of identical rooms in a row) which may have actually served as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>’ treasury. The exorbitant cost of these projects, coupled with the expense of the expedition to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, put a tremendous strain on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>' subjects through heavy taxation. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>, however, appeared not to notice a problem and continued to do as he pleased; because of this, his rule marks the beginning of the decline of the Achaemenid <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span>.
<br>
<br>According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>’ fondness for women and lack of restraint led to his pursuit of his brother <span style='color: blue'><b>Masistes</b></span>’ wife. When she refused him, he married one of his sons, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>, to the daughter of <span style='color: blue'><b>Masistes</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaynte</b></span>, in hopes that, by this union, he could get closer to his brother’s wife and manage to seduce her. When he saw <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaynte</b></span>, however, he desired her more than the mother and, when he approached her, she agreed to an affair. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> reports that, at about this same time, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>’ wife <span style='color: blue'><b>Amestris</b></span> had woven him a beautiful <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>shawl</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Shawl</b></span>, which he liked so much he wore everywhere. <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaynte</b></span> admired the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>shawl</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Shawl</b></span> and, one day when <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> told her that he would give her any gift she asked for, she requested the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>shawl</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Shawl</b></span>. He tried to get her to take any other gift instead because he knew that, should he give his mistress the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>shawl</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Shawl</b></span>, his wife would discover the affair. He had given his word, however, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaynte</b></span> refused any other gift, and so he gave her the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>shawl</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Shawl</b></span>.
<br>
<br>As he feared, <span style='color: blue'><b>Amestris</b></span> heard that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>’ mistress was wearing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>shawl</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Shawl</b></span> and plotted revenge. She decided to focus her energies, not on the mistress, but on <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaynte</b></span>’ s mother who she blamed for not raising a proper daughter (and, perhaps, because she had guessed that <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaynte</b></span> was <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>’ second choice in a mistress). At the royal banquet known as Tukta, which was held once a year and at which the king granted gifts to his subjects, <span style='color: blue'><b>Amestris</b></span> asked for <span style='color: blue'><b>Masistes</b></span>’ wife to be delivered to her. As with <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaynte</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>shawl</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Shawl</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> pleaded with <span style='color: blue'><b>Amestris</b></span> to make any other request, but she would not do so.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> then gave his brother’s wife to <span style='color: blue'><b>Amestris</b></span> who, according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, “sent for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>’ personal guards and with their help mutilated <span style='color: blue'><b>Masistes</b></span>’ wife. She cut off her breasts and threw them to the dogs, cut off her nose, ears, lips, and tongue, and then sent her back home totally disfigured” (9:112). In response, <span style='color: blue'><b>Masistes</b></span> tried to raise a revolt in Bactra but <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>, hearing of his plans, trapped him and killed him, his sons, and all of the men he had rallied to his cause. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> then returned to his building projects and designs for greater, grander, monuments to commemorate his reign and distinguish him from his father.  His development plans were cut short through his assassination by his minister <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artabanus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artabanus_of_Persia</b></span> (a different man than his uncle of the same name) who also murdered his son <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>’ other son, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artaxerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia</b></span>, then killed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artabanus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artabanus_of_Persia</b></span>, took the throne, and went on to complete <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>
