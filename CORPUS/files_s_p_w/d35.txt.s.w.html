<span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> , d. 497/496 BC, was the leader of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> in the late 6th century BC and early 5th century BC and a key player during the early years of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> Achaemenid <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span>.
<br>
<br>By the time extant history hears of him, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> is already serving as deputy governor of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, a polis on the western coast of <span style='color: blue'><b>Anatolia</b></span> around 500 BC. He was the son of Molpagoras, previous <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> of an independent <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, and brother-in-law[1] (and nephew[2]) of <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span>, whom the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> had set up as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span>, but never quite trusted. After general <span style='color: blue'><b>Megabazus</b></span> presented his complaints about <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, the latter summoned <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> to his court and detained him at <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span>, the main reason being that he wanted a trustworthy advisor.[1] On the recommendation of <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Achaemenids</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> then appointed <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> as the new ruler of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>.[1] <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> ruled <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> while <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> remained in <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The assignment</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Assignment_(1997_film)</b></span> was put forward as temporary. Privately, everyone knew that he was being kept under observation away from his troops.[3]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> was the main <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>orchestrator</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Orchestration</b></span> of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> on secret instruction by <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span>, when the latter learned of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> plans to interfere directly in <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> took advantage of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> dissatisfaction with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule to incite an alliance of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>poleis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Polis</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>. Soliciting assistance from the states of mainland <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> he failed to obtain the help of a major state, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>. He did obtain the half-hearted assistance of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>. Their attack on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrapy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span> having been defeated, they withdrew, abandoning <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> to his fate.
<br>
<br>In the last months of the failing revolt, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were reconquering rebel country <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span>. Choosing not to remain and make a stand alone, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> led a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>colony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Colonies_in_antiquity</b></span> to <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span>, where he had negotiated a franchise to settle from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thracians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thrace</b></span>. No sooner did he arrive than he and all his men were massacred in a surprise attack by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thracians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thrace</b></span>, for reasons unspecified by <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, whether loyal to the Great King, or influenced by the <span style='color: blue'><b>Scythians</b></span>, who hated the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> for their rescue of the Great King, or just because they changed their minds about the number of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> they would allow in their country. The revolt gained <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>momentum</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Momentum</b></span> briefly but then began to fail again. When all was nearly lost, the Great King allowed <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> to convince him that he could settle the conflict and now should be sent back to <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> was gone. According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, they never met again.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> never succeeded in reaching <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>. Reporting first to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>, undoubtedly still recovering from fire, whether with or without the Great King's complicity (<span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> does not say), he was interrogated concerning his true <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>loyalties</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Loyalties_(1933_film)</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> swore complete ignorance of the events of the revolt and unquestionable loyalty to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. He admitted nothing, but the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>, was not in the least deceived. He said, "I will tell thee how the case stands, Histaeus: this <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>shoe</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Shoe</b></span> is of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>thy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thy_(district)</b></span> stitching; <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> has but put it on.[4]
<br>
<br>Seeing that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>jig</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Jig</b></span> was up, <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> escaped that night and took ship at the coast, probably at <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephesus</b></span>. He had no trouble raising troops and finding ships, but he found that he was not trusted by the revolutionaries. <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> would not have him back. He became a soldier of fortune in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> until he was hunted down and executed by <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> was finally settled in 494/493 BC. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> went on to plot the conquest of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> under the pretext of a punitive campaign against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Certain exiled citizens of <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span> came to <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> to seek refuge. They asked <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> to supply them with troops, so that they could regain control of their homeland. <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> considered that if he was able to supply troops to the Naxians, then he could become ruler of <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>. So he agreed to assist the Naxians.[3] He explained that he did not have enough troops of his own, but that <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>’ brother and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span>, who commanded a large army and navy on the coast of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>, could help supply troops. The Naxians agreed to <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> seeking <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>' support and supplied him with money.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> travelled to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> and suggested that <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> attack <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span> and restore the exiles. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> would then gain control of the island. He explained to <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> that <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span> “was a fine and fertile island, close to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionians</b></span> coast, and rich both in treasures and slaves.”[5] It was also the gateway to the <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyclades</b></span>, which the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> did not yet rule. <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> promised that he would both fund the expedition and give <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> a bonus sum. He also tempted <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> by adding that capturing the island would place other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>poleis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Polis</b></span> of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyclades</b></span> under his control. They would serve as bases for an invasion of <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span>.[5] After securing the permission of <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> agreed and promised 200 ships.
<br>
<br>The following spring, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> and the Naxian exiles sailed with the fleet. Unfortunately for the success of the invasion, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> quarrelled with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>admiral</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Admiral</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Megabates</b></span>. He interfered in the discipline of the latter over the ship captains to save a friend from harsh punishment for an infraction (failure to set a watch on his ship). <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> saved his friend but lost the friendship and loyalty of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>admiral</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Admiral</b></span>, who expected to be in overall command. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>schism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Schism</b></span> was irreparable, being the very first incident of the subsequent <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Megabates</b></span> sabotaged the entire operation by secretly informing the Naxians that they were about to be attacked, taking away the element of surprise. <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span> then had enough time to prepare for a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span>. Four months later, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span> still held, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were out of supplies and had only limited funds remaining. The expedition was then considered a failure and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> sailed home.[6]
<br>
<br>Due to his failure to make good on his Naxian promises, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>’ political position was at risk. He began to plan a revolt with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> and the other <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span>. Meanwhile, <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span>, still detained at <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span>, had tattooed a message upon the shaved head of a slave. Once his hair had grown back, he sent him to <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The message</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Message_(Grandmaster_Flash_and_the_Furious_Five_song)</b></span> told <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> to revolt. <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span>, desperate to resume his authority at <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, hoped <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> would send him to deal with a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> revolt.
<br>
<br>Both leaders being of the same mind, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> conferred with a council of his supporters, who agreed to a rebellion in <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> in 499 BC. <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> was supported by most of the citizens in council, except the historian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hecataeus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hecataeus_of_Miletus</b></span>.[7] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hecataeus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hecataeus_of_Miletus</b></span> voted against the revolt because he believed that the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> would be out-matched. Defeat would be inevitable. Once the vote was taken, however, there is no evidence that he recused himself from the revolt. In fact, he had suggestions to make. Once the war began, the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> did not allow any fence-sitting among themselves, although they could not stop the larger allies from withdrawing. In general knowledge, warring nations do not allow citizens of any social status to comment from the sidelines without participating in the war effort.
<br>
<br>As soon as the vote for war was certain, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> took steps to secure <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> military assets. The <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span> fleet was recovering from its ordeal at <span style='color: blue'><b>Myus</b></span>. Now in a position of command – <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> is not specific – <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> sent a party under Iatragoras to arrest the admirals still with the fleet, some several men. Ironically, these were mainly <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. They were later released and sent home. Now that the rebellion was in the open, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> “set himself to damage <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> in every way he could think of.”[8]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The scope</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Norfolk_Scope</b></span> of the revolt spread rapidly to all <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> foresaw that one <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> would soon be crushed. He therefore set about to create an alliance of all the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> cities, but the members also came from regions beyond <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span>. He made a number of constitutional changes, not all of which are clear. First he relinquished his own tyranny. Approaching the other states, he convinced them to end theirs.[8] Finally he ordered all of the states to create a board of generals[9] to report, apparently, to him. When his government was in place he sailed to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lacedaemon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sparta</b></span> and other states of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> in search of allies.
<br>
<br>There has been some question as to the exact meaning of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' governmental terms, and as to the form of government of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> alliance. The most fundamental question is where <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> got his authority over the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> in the first place. They were all under the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrapy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span>, not under <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> was <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> was appointed by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span>, but he also appointed all the other tyrants. For reasons not specified in <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> had the upper hand.[10]
<br>
<br>One can only assume a leadership role of some kind of <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> over the other tyrants, whether personal or according to some unspecified convention. In order to gain the participation of the people in the revolt, we are told, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> "let go" the tyranny and established <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>isonomia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Isonomia</b></span>, which the translators translate variously with imprecise terms, such as "equality of government." According to Liddell and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Scott</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Walter_Scott</b></span>, a standard dictionary of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ancient Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> uses it to mean the "equality of rights" in a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Apparently <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> established <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span>, but then he went on to "put a stop to tyranny" in all the other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> cities, and moreover to insist that they select boards of generals reporting to him, which are not democratic powers. No voting is mentioned. Apparently a new sovereign state had been formed with <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> as its chief. He had not stepped down, but up. The state had the power to levy taxes and troops. <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> was commander of the joint armed forces. <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> was to be the new capital. In fact the new sovereign <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> issued its own coinage between 499 and its destruction by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> in 494.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> appealed to the Spartan king, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span>, to help them throw off the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> yoke. He praised the quality of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartan warriors</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, and argued that a pre-emptive invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> would be easy. To illustrate his view, he had brought along a "bronze tablet on which a map of all the earth was engraved, and all the sea, and all the rivers."[11] No more information is given about the map, but the circumstantial evidence suggests it was most likely the world map of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hecataeus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hecataeus_of_Miletus</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, an important player in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> political life of the times.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> claimed that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> would be easy to defeat, as they fought in “trousers and turbans,” clearly not a sign of good warriors.[12] He also tempted him with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> riches. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span> asked <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> to wait two days for an answer. When they next met, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span> asked how long it would take to reach <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span>, and upon learning that it was a three months’ journey, he firmly refused Spartan assistance as his troops would be gone for too long. At the time, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> was concerned over possible attacks from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Argives</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Argos</b></span>.[13] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> claimed that <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> attempted to change <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span>’ mind with bribes, until the king's young daughter <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Gorgo</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gorgon</b></span> warned that <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> would corrupt him.[14] <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> left without the requested assistance.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> next went to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>, where he made a convincing speech, promising “everything that came into his head, until at last he succeeded.”[15] Won over, the Athenians agreed to send ships to <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> went before them. The Athenians subsequently arrived in <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> with twenty triremes and five others that belonged to the Eretrians. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> described the arrival of these ships as the beginning of troubles between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and barbarians.[16] Once all his allies had arrived, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> put his brother Charopinus and another <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span>, Hermophantus, in charge of the expedition, and the whole contingent set out for the provincial capital, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>, while <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> remained to govern at <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>.
<br>
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>acropolis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Acropolis_of_Athens</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>, now forested and eroded, with a few pinnacles of ruins. About half the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>massif</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Massif</b></span> is shown at an angle of elevation so close under the cliffs as to accentuate the perception of height.
<br>The first leg of the journey was to proceed along the coast to <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephesus</b></span>. Using it as base, they went overland to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>, on which they descended by surprise. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> and his forces retreated to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>acropolis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Acropolis_of_Athens</b></span> immediately. A fire, started by accident in the town, accidentally burned down the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>temple</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_temple</b></span> of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydians</b></span> goddess Cybebe (<span style='color: blue'><b>Cybele</b></span>). Attributing the fire to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionians</b></span> maliciousness, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> later used it as an excuse for burning <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> temples.
<br>
<br>The fire forced the defenders of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>acropolis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Acropolis_of_Athens</b></span> to abandon it in favor of the marketplace. Its defence coincided fortuitously with the arrival of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> reinforcements. Interpreting the tumult as a counter-attack, The <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> retreated to <span style='color: blue'><b>Tmolus</b></span>, a nearby elevation, from which they escaped by night.[17] The reinforcements followed the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span>, caught up with them near <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephesus</b></span> and soundly defeated them.[18]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> had obtained <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span>, including all the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities, by defeating the last Anatolian-speaking kingdom of the same name. They made such a show of mercy as to win the hearts and minds of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Anatolians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Anatolians</b></span>, as well as of some of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. In that sense, the "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>" was <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>de facto</span> <span style='color: green'><b>De_facto</b></span> an Anatolian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>civil war</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Civil_war</b></span>. A call for assistance went rapidly around the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrapy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span>. Joint Persian-Anatolian forces hastened overnight to the assistance of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span>.
<br>
<br>They arrived with such short notice and major fanfare as to frighten away the Ionian-Athenian forces. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Cambridge Ancient History</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Cambridge_Ancient_History</b></span> article attributes this swift arrival to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>, which also had no trouble tracking and catching the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> before the gates of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephesus</b></span>. The losses of the East <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> were so great that they slunk away, so to speak, leaving <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> and the rebels to fend for themselves. An air of doom pervaded the revolt, but they fought with such spirit that the rebellion spilled over into the islands
<br>
<br>After this <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, the Athenians refused to continue to fight in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> and returned to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span>. Because of their participation in this <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, however, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> king, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>, swore vengeance on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> and commanded a servant to repeat to him three times every day at dinner, “Master, remember the Athenians.”[19] The story is somewhat and probably hypocritically naive (but not necessarily on that account false), as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> intended expansion into the <span style='color: blue'><b>Balkans</b></span> all along. They still held parts of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span> from their previous abortive expedition into <span style='color: blue'><b>Scythia</b></span>, only stopped when they learned the true size of the country (most of Russia) and the danger of their position in it.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> fought on, gaining control of <span style='color: blue'><b>Byzantium</b></span> and the surrounding towns as well as the greater part of <span style='color: blue'><b>Caria</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Caunus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kaunos</b></span>. They were not, however, alone. In this last phase of the conflict, almost all of <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyprus</b></span> also rebelled against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Onesilus</b></span>, the younger brother of <span style='color: blue'><b>Gorgus</b></span>, the ruler of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>, tried to convince his brother to rebel against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> and join in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>. When his brother refused to support the revolt, <span style='color: blue'><b>Onesilus</b></span> waited until he left <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> and then shut the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> gates on him. <span style='color: blue'><b>Gorgus</b></span> fled to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> while <span style='color: blue'><b>Onesilus</b></span> took over and convinced the Cyprians to revolt. They then proceeded to lay <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span> to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Amathus</b></span>.[20]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>’ account is the best source we have on the events that amounted to a collision between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, which was expanding westward, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>classical Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> at its peak. Nevertheless its depictions are often scanty and uncertain, or incomplete. One of the major uncertainties of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> is why it occurred in the first place.
<br>
<br>In retrospect the case seems obvious: <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> disputed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> for control of cities and territories. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> had either to fight for their freedom or submit. The desirability of these material objects was certainly economic, although considerations of defense and ideology may well have played a part. These are the motives generally accepted today, after long retrospect.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> apparently knew of no such motives, or if he did, he did not care to analyse history at that level. J D <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Manville</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Johns_Manville</b></span> characterizes his approach as the attribution of “personal motivation” to players such as <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span>. In his view, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> “may seem to overemphasize personal motivation as a cause,” but he really does not. We have either to fault <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> for his lack of analytical perspicacity or try to find credible reasons in the historical context for actions to which <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> gives incomplete explanations.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Manville</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Johns_Manville</b></span> suggests that the unexplained places mark events in a secret scenario about which <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> could not have known, but he records what he does know <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>faithfully</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Flat_module</b></span>. It is up to the historian to reconstruct the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>secret history</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Secret_history</b></span> by re-interpretation and speculation, a technique often used by historical novelists. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Manville</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Johns_Manville</b></span> puts it forward as history.
<br>
<br>The main players are portrayed by <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> as naturally hypocritical. They always have an ulterior motive which they go to great <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>lengths</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Horse_length</b></span> to conceal behind persuasive lies. Thus neither <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> nor <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> are fighting for freedom, nor do they cooperate or collaborate. Each has a personal motive related to greed, ambition, or fear. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Manville</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Johns_Manville</b></span> fills in the uncertainties with hypothetical motives. Thus he arrives, perhaps less credibly for his invention, at a behind-the-scenes struggle for dominance between <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span>. They can best be described as rivals or even enemies.[21] Some of the high points of the argument are as follows.
<br>
<br>While <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> was away serving <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> acted in his stead as deputy of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> where, it is argued, he worked on securing his own power. The word for deputy is <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>epitropos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Regent</b></span>, which he was when the Naxian deputation arrived. By the time the fleet departs for <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> has promoted himself to “<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>.” There is no explicit statement that he asked <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span>’ permission or was promoted by Histaeus. Instead, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> turned to <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>, who was said to be jealous of <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span>. It is true that <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> would not move without consulting the Great King, and that the latter’s advisor on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> affairs was <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span>. However, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Manville</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Johns_Manville</b></span> sees a coup by <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>, presuming not only that the Great King’s advisor did not advise, but was kept in the dark about his own supersession.
<br>
<br>When the expedition failed, <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> sent his tattooed slave to <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>, not as encouragement to revolt, but as an ultimatum. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Manville</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Johns_Manville</b></span> provides an underlying value system to fill in the gap left by <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>: revolt was so <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>unthinkable</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Unthinkable</b></span> that <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> could bring the fantasies of his opponent back to reality by suggesting that he do it, a sort of “go ahead, commit <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>suicide</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Suicide</b></span>.” <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> was, in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Manville</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Johns_Manville</b></span>’s speculation, ordering <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> to give up his rule or suffer the consequences. Apparently, he was not being kept in the dark by the king after all. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Manville</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Johns_Manville</b></span> leaves us to guess why the king did not just crush the revolt by returning the supposedly loyal <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> to power.
<br>
<br>However, at this time <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> was still required to remain in <span style='color: blue'><b>Susa</b></span> and, despite his threat, he was unable to do anything if <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> did revolt. Realizing that this would be his last chance to gain power <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> started the revolt despite <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span>’ threat. This is a surprise to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Manville</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Johns_Manville</b></span>’s readers, as we thought he already had power via a coup. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Manville</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Johns_Manville</b></span> does note the contradiction mentioned above, that <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> gave up tyranny, yet was able to force <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Democracy</b></span> on the other cities and command their obedience to him. We are to see in this <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>paradox</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Paradox</b></span> a strategy to depose <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span>, whom we thought was already deposed.
<br>
<br>The tale goes on to an attempt by <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> to form an alliance with <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> to depose the usurper and regain his power at <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span>, though he was involved in open war with <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>, refuses.[22] The tale told by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Manville</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Johns_Manville</b></span> thus contains events related by <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> supplemented by non-events coming from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Manville</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Johns_Manville</b></span>’s imagination.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>John Myres</span> <span style='color: green'><b>John_Myres</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>classical archaeologist</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_archaeology</b></span> and scholar, whose career began in the reign of Queen <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Victoria</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Queen_Victoria</b></span> and did not end until 1954, close friend and companion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Arthur Evans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Arthur_Evans</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>intelligence</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Intelligence</b></span> officer par excellence of the British <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span>, developed a theory of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> that explains it in terms of the stock political views of the empire, balance of power and power <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vacuum</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Power_vacuum</b></span>. Those views, still generally familiar, assert that peace is to be found in a region controlled by competing geopolitical powers, none of which are strong enough to defeat the others. If a power drops from the roster for any reason, a “<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vacuum</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Power_vacuum</b></span>” then exists, which causes violent competition until the balance is readjusted.
<br>
<br>In a key article of 1906, while <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Evans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Godfrey_Evans</b></span> was excavating <span style='color: blue'><b>Knossos</b></span>, the Ottoman <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span> had lost <span style='color: blue'><b>Crete</b></span> due to British intervention, and questions of the “sick man of <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>” were being considered by all the powers, referring to the failing Ottoman <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span> and the power <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>vacuum</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Power_vacuum</b></span> that would be left when it fell, the young Myres published an article studying the balance of what he termed “sea-power” in the eastern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mediterranean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mediterranean_Sea</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>classical</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_antiquity</b></span> times. The word "sea-power" was intended to define his “<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>thalassocracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thalassocracy</b></span>.”
<br>
<br>Myres was using sea-power in a specifically British sense for the times. The Americans had their own idea of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sea power</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Command_of_the_sea</b></span>, expressed in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alfred</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alfred_the_Great</b></span> Thayer <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mahan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alfred_Thayer_Mahan</b></span>’s great strategic work, ‘’The Influence of Sea Power upon History’’. which advocated maintaining a powerful navy and using it for strategic purposes, such as “command of the sea,” a kind of domination. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>United States Naval Academy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>United_States_Naval_Academy</b></span> used this meaning for its motto, ‘’ex scientia tridens’’, “sea-power through knowledge.” It named one of its buildings, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mahan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alfred_Thayer_Mahan</b></span> Hall.
<br>
<br>Far different is Myres’ “sea-power” and the meaning of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>thalassocracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thalassocracy</b></span>, which means “rule of the seas.“ In contrast to “tridens,” rule of the seas is not a paternalistic but democratic arrangement. Where there are rulers, there are the ruled. A kind of exclusivity is meant, such as in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Rule, Britannia!</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Rule,_Britannia!</b></span>. Specifically, in a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>thalassocracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thalassocracy</b></span>, the fleets of the ruler may go where they will and do as they please, but the ruled may go nowhere and engage in no operation without express permission of the ruler. You need a license, so to speak, to be on ruled waters, and if you do not have it, your ships are attacked and destroyed. “Shoot on sight” is the policy. And so <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Carthaginian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Carthage</b></span> ships sank any ships in their waters, etc.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Thalassocracy</b></span> was a new word in the theories of the late 19th century, from which some conclude it was a scholarly innovation of the times. It was rather a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>resurrection</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Resurrection_of_Jesus</b></span> of a word known from a very specific <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>classical</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_antiquity</b></span> document, which Myres calls “the List of Thalassocracies.” It occurs in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chronicon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thietmar_of_Merseburg</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Eusebius</b></span>, the early 4th century Bishop of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Caesarea Maritima</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Caesarea_Maritima</b></span>, the ruins now in <span style='color: blue'><b>Israel</b></span>.[23] In <span style='color: blue'><b>Eusebius</b></span>, the list is a separate chronology. <span style='color: blue'><b>Jerome</b></span>, 4th-century <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>theologian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Theology</b></span> and historian, creator of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Vulgate</b></span>, interspersed the same items, translated into <span style='color: blue'><b>Latin</b></span>, in his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Chronicon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thietmar_of_Merseburg</b></span> of world events.[24] The items contain the words “obtinuerunt <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mare</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mare</b></span>,” <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>strictly speaking</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Strictly_Speaking</b></span>, “obtained the sea,” and not “hold <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sea power</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Command_of_the_sea</b></span>,” although the latter meaning may be implied as a result. Just as <span style='color: blue'><b>Jerome</b></span> utilized the chronology of <span style='color: blue'><b>Eusebius</b></span>, so <span style='color: blue'><b>Eusebius</b></span> utilized the chronology of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Castor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Castor_of_Rhodes</b></span>, a 1st-century BC historian. His work has been entirely lost except for fragments, including his list of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>thalassocracies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thalassocracy</b></span>. A thousand years later, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Byzantine</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Byzantine_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>monk</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Monk</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>George Syncellus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>George_Syncellus</b></span>, also used items from the list in his massive Extract of Chronography.

<br>Over the centuries the realization grew that all these references to sea-power in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> came from a single document, a resource now reflected in the fragments of those who relied on it. C <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bunsen</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Christian_Charles_Josias_von_Bunsen</b></span>, whose translator was one of the first to use <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>thalassocracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thalassocracy</b></span>, attributed its discovery to the German scholar, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Christian Gottlob Heyne</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Christian_Gottlob_Heyne</b></span>[25] In a short work composed in 1769, published in 1771,[26] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Eusebius' Chronicon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chronicon_(Eusebius)</b></span> being known at that time only through fragments in the two authors mentioned, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Heyne</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Christian_Gottlob_Heyne</b></span> reconstructed the list in their Greek and <span style='color: blue'><b>Latin</b></span> (with uncanny accuracy), the whole title of the article being Super Castoris epochis populorum thalattokratesanton H.E. (hoc est) qui <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>imperium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Imperium</b></span> maris tenuisse dicuntur, “About <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Castor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Castor_of_Rhodes</b></span>’s epochs of thalattocratizing peoples; that is, those who are said to have held the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>imperium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Imperium</b></span> over the sea.” To thalattokratize is “to rule the sea,” not just to hold <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sea power</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Command_of_the_sea</b></span> like any other good fellow with a strong navy. The thalattokratizer holds the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>imperium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Imperium</b></span> over the watery domain just as if it were a country, which explains how such a people can “obtain” and “have” the sea. The list presented therefore is one of successive exclusive domains. No two peoples can hold the same domain or share rule over it, although they can operate under the authority of the thalassocrat, a privilege reserved for paying allies.
<br>
<br>According to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bunsen</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Robert_Bunsen</b></span>, the discovery and translation of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Armenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Armenian_language</b></span> version of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Eusebius' Chronicon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chronicon_(Eusebius)</b></span> changed the nature of the search for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>thalassocracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thalassocracy</b></span>. It provided the original document, but there was a disclaimer attached, that it was in fact “an extract from the epitome of Diodorus,” meaning <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Diodorus Siculus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Diodorus_Siculus</b></span>, a 1st century BC historian. The disclaimer cannot be verified, as that part of Diodorus’ work is missing, which, however, opens the argument to another question: if <span style='color: blue'><b>Eusebius</b></span> could copy a standard source from Diodorus, why cannot Diodorus have copied it from someone else?
<br>
<br>It is at this point that Myres picks up the argument. Noting that thalassokratesai, “be a thalassokrat,” meaning “rule the waves,” was used in a number of authors: elsewhere by Diodorus, by <span style='color: blue'><b>Polybius</b></span>, 2nd century BC historian, of <span style='color: blue'><b>Carthage</b></span>, of <span style='color: blue'><b>Chios</b></span> by <span style='color: blue'><b>Strabo</b></span>, 1st century BC geographer and some others, he supposes that s stock document might have been available to them all (but not necessarily, the cautious Myres points out).[27] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The document</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Document</b></span> can be dated by its content: a list of 17 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>thalassocracies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thalassocracy</b></span> extending from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> after the fall of <span style='color: blue'><b>Troy</b></span> to the Aeginetan, which ended with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cession</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cession</b></span> of power to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> in 480 BC. The Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> included 200 new <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> triremes plus all the ships of its new ally, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span>. Despite various revolts <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span> went on to become part of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>, an imperial treaty of the new <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>thalassocracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thalassocracy</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> writes of it after 432 BC, but <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, who visited <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> “as late as 444 B.C.” does not know a thing about it. This tentative date for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Eusebian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Eusebius</b></span> list does not exclude the possibility of an earlier similar document used by <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>.[28]
<br>
<br>The order of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>thalassocracies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thalassocracy</b></span> in the various versions of the list is nearly fixed, but the dates need considerable adjustment, which Myres sets about to reconcile through all historical sources available to him. He discovers some gaps. The solidest part of the list brackets the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>thalassocracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thalassocracy</b></span> is dated 604-585 BC. It was ended by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alyattes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alyattes_of_Lydia</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span>, founder of the Lydian <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span>, who also fought against the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>. The latter struggle was ended by the Eclipse of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thales</b></span> at the Battle of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Halys River</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kızılırmak_River</b></span> in 585 BC, when the combatants, interpreting the phenomenon as a sign, made peace. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> were now free to turn on <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, which they did for the next 11 years, reducing it. When the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> conquered <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span> in 547/546 they acquired the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> cities.
<br>
<br>After 585 is a gap in the list. <span style='color: blue'><b>Lesbos</b></span> and one or more unknown thalassocrats held the sea in unknown order.[29] In 577 began the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>thalassocracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thalassocracy</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Phocaea</b></span>. Breaking out of its Anatolian cage, it founded <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marseilles</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Marseille</b></span> and cities in Spain and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Italy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Italian_Peninsula</b></span>, wresting a domain away from <span style='color: blue'><b>Carthage</b></span> and all other opponents.[30] Their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>thalassocracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thalassocracy</b></span> ended when, in the revolt of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pactyas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pactyes</b></span>, who had been instructed to collect taxes by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, but used them to raise an army of revolt, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionians</b></span> cities were attacked by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phocaeans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocaea</b></span> abandoned <span style='color: blue'><b>Phocaea</b></span> about <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>534 BC</span> <span style='color: green'><b>534_BC</b></span> and after much adventuring settled in the west.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>thalassocracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thalassocracy</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span> spans the career of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Polycrates</b></span>, there.[31] The dates of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> are somewhat uncertain and variable, but at some time prior to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>534 BC</span> <span style='color: green'><b>534_BC</b></span>, he and his brothers staged a coup during a festival at <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span> happened to have a large navy of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pentekonters</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Penteconter</b></span>. Becoming a ship collector, he attacked and subdued all the neighbouring islands, adding their ships to his fleet. Finally he added a new model, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>trireme</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Trireme</b></span>. His reign came to an end about 517 BC when, taking up the Great King’s invitation to a friendly banquet for a discussion of prospects, he was suddenly assassinated. There were no prospects.
<br>
<br>However, if he had chosen not to attend, he was doomed anyway. Some of his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>trireme</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Trireme</b></span> captains, learning of a devious plot by him to have them assassinated by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> dignitaries while on official business, sailed to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> to beg help, which they received. The adventurous young king, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cleomenes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cleomenes_I</b></span>, was spared the trouble of killing <span style='color: blue'><b>Polycrates</b></span>, but led an expedition to <span style='color: blue'><b>Samos</b></span> anyway, taking the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>thalassocracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thalassocracy</b></span> for two years, 517-515. Adventure and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>piracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Piracy</b></span> not being activities approved by the Spartan people, they tagged him as insane and insisted he come home.[32] The sea was now available to <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>, 515-505.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> had obtained a foothold on the coast of <span style='color: blue'><b>Anatolia</b></span> by siding with rebel coastal Anatolian states against the Hittite <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span>.[33] Their position was made more solid by the fall of <span style='color: blue'><b>Troy</b></span> against a coalition of mainland <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> kings. The coastal cities managed to retain their positions against the subsequent <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phrygian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phrygia</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue'><b>Anatolia</b></span> by joining with the rump Anatolian states, while the <span style='color: blue'><b>Hittites</b></span> withdrew into <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>neo-Hittite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Syro-Hittite_states</b></span> states in <span style='color: blue'><b>Syria</b></span>. The coastal cities, now entirely <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, continued to receive immigrants from mainland <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The massive</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Massive_(comics)</b></span> transfer of Persian-speaking population from the steppes of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Central Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Central_Asia</b></span> to the range they now occupy presented the Anatolian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> with an impossible strategic problem. They could not hope to oppose their small armies against the resources of the vast <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> empire unless they could once again receive major support from the mainland <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> states, especially the maritime power of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>. Those states, however, were reluctant to take on the might of ancient <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Consequently the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> states in <span style='color: blue'><b>Anatolia</b></span> submitted reluctantly to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule, and were placed in the new <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrapy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span>, with capital at <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span> allowed self-rule as long as taxes were paid and the supremacy of ancient <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> was granted. Many of the Anatolian cities proved loyal subjects. However, underlying resentment against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule was universal.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> was not interested in the status <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>quo</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Quo_(Status_Quo_album)</b></span>. Their desire to expand to the west brought them into conflict with <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> over the question of self-rule, one of the principles of the agreement of the city-states to submit. Their interference in <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> was the spark that set off the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>, the first rebel ruler, appeared then as the champion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> freedom. The <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> had high hopes of independence.
<br>
<br>Due to the disparity in resources and the reluctance of the mainland states to involve themselves, the tide soon turned in favour of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. After only one year, the Cyprians were once again forced into submission by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. The cities around the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> fell one after another to Daurises, the son-in-law of king <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue'><b>Carians</b></span> fought the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Maeander River</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Büyük_Menderes_River</b></span> and were defeated with severe casualties.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>, seeing the rebellion falling to pieces around him, and little help forthcoming from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, began looking for a shelter to which he could execute a strategic retreat. He and his men resolved on Myrcinus in <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span>, which had been an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> stronghold in the abortive <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue'><b>Scythia</b></span>. He put <span style='color: blue'><b>Pythagoras</b></span>, “a man of distinction,” in charge of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> and set sail for <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span>, where he attempted to establish a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>colony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Colonies_in_antiquity</b></span> on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Strymon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Struma_(river)</b></span> river, at the same site as the later <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>History_of_Athens</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>colony</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Colonies_in_antiquity</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Amphipolis</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thracians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thrace</b></span>, not now disposed to tolerate any further presence of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> in their country, opposed this incursion. He gained control of the territory but later, while besieging a neighbouring town, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> was killed in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>.[34]
<br>
<br>Expecting a swift <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> victory, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> had hoped to establish a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>redoubt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Redoubt</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span>, who would come to the assistance of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> at a later time.[35] By an accidental sequence of historical events his reputation drew the ire of his main historian, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> of Halicarnassus, an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionians</b></span> partisan, to such a degree that it suffers yet. Although a champion of freedom, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> is the only man in all his histories that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> openly calls a coward, blaming his supposed flight for the defeat of the revolt. The revolt apparently intensified and spread into the islands. <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> had no way of knowing that he would have been in the van of it, or that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thracians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thrace</b></span> would not allow a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>redoubt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Redoubt</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The revolt was over by 494/493 BC. Going directly for <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span> in 494, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> defeated the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> with their own weapon, the ship, in the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span>, an island off <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> was then subject to a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>siege</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Siege</b></span> and the war lost at its fall. Although there was some mild devastation of rebel cities (except for <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, which was razed and the population decimated and transported), the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were interested in ruling rather than revenge. They began to plan forthwith for the largest invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> yet undertaken, executed starting 490 BC in a series of conflicts called the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, which are yet famous. Unfortunately for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, they were forced to adopt contingents of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> into their armies and navies.
<br>
<br>Most of the information on <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> and his actions comes from the writings of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ancient Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>. On the one hand he is virtually the only literary source for the events he presents as history. While in many ways he reflects some of the best of ancient <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>historiography</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Historiography</b></span>, on the other hand, his work is sprinkled with motivational and logical <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>lacunae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Non_liquet</b></span>, creating textual paradoxes everywhere, causing some scholars to be critical of his value as a historical source, especially regarding the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>. For purposes of this presentation, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>textual criticism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Textual_criticism</b></span> may be polarized into two camps: the cynical, discrediting <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> as an unreliable source, and the affirmative, which credits him with being reliable as far as he goes.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Manville</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Johns_Manville</b></span>'s cynical view concerning an imaginary power struggle between <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> isolated from the usual contexts of war and society has already been mentioned above. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Manville</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Johns_Manville</b></span> has no confidence in <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' ability to relate connected history and therefore supplies connections for him out of his own speculations. He was preceded in this method by the earlier work of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mabel Lang</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mabel_Lang</b></span>. A 1968 article by Lang focuses on the paradoxes of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span>. For example, <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> originally won the Great King's favor by protecting his escape from <span style='color: blue'><b>Scythia</b></span> over a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>key bridge</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Key_Bridge_(Washington,_D.C.)</b></span> of the <span style='color: blue'><b>Danube</b></span>.[36] Despite this vital rescue to save the king and all his forces, he shortly after plots a rebellion!
<br>
<br>Lang suggests that one might conclude to an ulterior motive at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>bridge</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bridge</b></span>, "to ingratiate himself with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> so that he could be on the inside of the king's policy."[37] Apparently, to be on the inside of his policy he has to save his life and the lives of all his army by letting him escape from the large <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Scythian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Scythians</b></span> army not far behind. He prefers to keep him alive for nothing more serious than keeping an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>eye</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Eye</b></span> on him. Nonchalantly Lang writes: "Presumably revolt was already in the air,...." It could not have been far in the air if <span style='color: blue'><b>Histiaeus</b></span> passed up a chance for total victory at the outset, a prized goal of many a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>lightning</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lightning</b></span> campaign in world history afterwards.
<br>
<br>The basic problem is Lang's cynicism: "we should not hope to discover the truth about the result merely by accepting the narrative ...."[38] Accordingly she rehearses a catalogue of paradoxes similar to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Manville</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Johns_Manville</b></span>'s <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>weaving</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Weaving</b></span> her own <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>fantasy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Fantasy</b></span> of unattested events to contain it. Her explanation of why such a tale is necessary is similarly speculative: "the failure of the revolt not only gave prominence to every aspect and event which would explain, justify or anticipate the disastrous results but also cast into the shade any intentions which deserved a better fate and any temporary successes during the course of the war." Not having any other account with which to compare these events, she cannot possibly know that.
<br>
<br>The cynical view described above reflects a difference in expectation between <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> and his target audiences, which by the accidents of time are multiple and various. He did not write for us moderns. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Reading</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Reading_railway_station</b></span> that he was the first historian whose work survived in anything more than scattered fragments, we expect him to have the proper concern of modern historians for continuity and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>causality</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Causality</b></span>, which other ancient historians, such as <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>, have. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> is not one of those. With regard to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>causation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Causality</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambridge Ancient History</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Cambridge_Ancient_History</b></span> article asserts: “...<span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> does not seem to have innovated: he merely accepted the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>causation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Causality</b></span> appropriate to his subject and period.”[39]
<br>
<br>It would be convenient to attribute this unconcern to a sort of intermediate phase between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mythology</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mythology</b></span> and history, as many do. Such a view is neglectful of the ravages of time. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> was not the first historian in any way, only the first whose work survived. He wrote of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> a full generation after it happened; moreover, he was not a participant. He relied on the work of several previous historians at <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, of which fragments and mention have survived, chief of which was <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hecataeus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hecataeus_of_Miletus</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>.[40]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> apparently designed his work according to a specific plan and style. Whether the previous historians used it is not known, due to the paucity of evidence, but it seems unlikely. He appears to use <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hecataeus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hecataeus_of_Miletus</b></span> as a framework for his historical events. The fragments of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hecataeus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hecataeus_of_Miletus</b></span> suggest that he wrote only an annal-like sequence long on names and events but short on connecting narrative. To this framework <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>adds</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Applied_Digital_Data_Systems</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>logoi</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Logos</b></span>, or independent anecdotes of persons and events derived from independent oral traditions, which <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> obtained by interview with record-keepers and state historians. The disconnectedness comes from their being independent. It is pointless, therefore, to try to invent connections.[41]
<br>
<br>The ancient historians have therefore invented a special category for <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, that he was a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>logographer</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Logographer_(legal)</b></span>, or teller of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>logoi</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Logos</b></span>, based on his own characterization of his sources as logopoioi, “story makers.” Usually the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>logographers</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Logographer_(history)</b></span> include <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hecataeus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hecataeus_of_Miletus</b></span> and the other historians of his generation, who lived through the revolt. There is little evidence of their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>logography</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Logogram</b></span>. Whether <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> stands alone or is part of a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Milesian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Miletus</b></span> tradition is a matter of speculation.
<br>
<br>Validation of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> therefore rests on validation of his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>logoi</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Logos</b></span>. There is no general validation, but the much-desired archaeological and inscriptional evidence appears to validate a few events as far as they go: some names, circumstances of war, and similar peripheral facts. He cannot be validated as a modern historian, but he does have an overall design, which is “Biblical” or “Bible-like” in scope. He is trying to do an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>epic</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Epic_poetry</b></span> in prose similar to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Homerica</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Homer</b></span> in verse. His topic is not the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Trojan War</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Trojan_War</b></span>, but the Graeco-Persian Wars. (The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Homerica</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Homer</b></span> have been called the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pagan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Paganism</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> “<span style='color: blue'><b>Bible</b></span>.") Says <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Oswyn Murray</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Oswyn_Murray</b></span> in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambridge Ancient History</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Cambridge_Ancient_History</b></span>,[42]
<br>
<br>It is certainly hard to find fault with his general view that the only adequate explanation for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> must be a complete account of relations between the two peoples since the conquest of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionians</b></span> cities in 545 B.C.
<br>
<br>In short, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> is personal because the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Homerica</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Homer</b></span> are personal. Both genres intend to portray the illustrious or non-illustrius deeds and doings of persons in the contexts of mighty wars. Thus <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span> personally can be called a “coward.” The lying that they do is metis, “cunning,”[43] an admired <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek</b></span> virtue practised by the greatest hero of them all, the crafty <span style='color: blue'><b>Odysseus</b></span>. The literary tradition of it went on. <span style='color: blue'><b>Virgil</b></span> could include the half-line Timeo Graecos dona ferentes, “I fear <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks bearing Gifts</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greeks_Bearing_Gifts_(Torchwood)</b></span>,” in the <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeneid</b></span>.
<br>
<br>The expectation of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>modernity</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Modernity</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> is misplaced. Validation must be sought for individual <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>logoi</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Logos</b></span>. The whole work or any part of it cannot logically be condemned on the basis of one or a group of paradoxes. All scepticism must have a reason for doubting. The inconsistencies of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> are not a valid reason, which is generally true. But few stories are ever free of inconsistency, and if they are, they are suspect on that account (“too good to be true”).
<br>
<br>Denials of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' validity, from mild to severe, although widespread, were never universal. As an example of ancient information generally agreed to be invalid, many works attributed to various authors have been placed in the "pseudo-" category after as much as centuries of review. There was never any such universal and long-standing denial of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>. On the contrary, the main events, such as the Battles of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thermopylae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span>, have been accepted as basically credible by many scholars of many ages. It is therefore misplaced to speak of the "rehabilitation" of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> in medical or neo-ideologic terms.
<br>
<br>Accordingly the most sanguine view treats his work as though no problems exist regarding it. Referring to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambridge Ancient History</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Cambridge_Ancient_History</b></span> article on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Murray</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Murray_River</b></span>, Georges addresses "the question of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' veracity and reliability."[44] Repeating <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Murray</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Murray_River</b></span>'s criticism that "the traditions concerning the revolt itself are ... fragmented into individual episodes of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>folly</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Folly</b></span>, treachery, or heroism" and therefore are not "trustworthy materials for the history of the revolt," he asserts to the contrary that "<span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' account furnishes the material for a coherent and credible account of the actions and events it presents ...."
<br>
<br>Having said this, Georges must now show that, rather than being paradoxical, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> is coherent and credible. Like Lang, having no other account to offer, he must make his demonstrations from the text of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, which he spends the rest of the article doing, disputing most of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Murray</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Murray_River</b></span>'s interpretations. The contradictions are not to be viewed as contradictions. He does not address the question of why, if they are not so, it is necessary to spend an article in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>disputation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Disputation</b></span> over them. The result is a new set of speculations fully as imaginary as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Murray</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Murray_River</b></span>'s, not being based on any alternative texts.
<br>
<br>There is hope, however, as fragments of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_language</b></span> texts and inscriptions continue to be discovered. Meanwhile it seems common knowledge that the public of any age is not going to relinquish credibility in <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' great depiction of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>
