<br>In the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> in 480 BC, an alliance of South <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states fought the invading <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army in the pass of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>. Vastly outnumbered, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> delayed the enemy in one of the most famous last stands of history. A small force led by King <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> blocked the only road through which the massive army of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> could pass. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> succeeded in defeating the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> but sustained heavy losses, disproportionate to those of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. A local resident named <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ephialtes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephialtes_of_Trachis</b></span> betrayed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, revealing a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mountain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mountain_gun</b></span> path that led behind the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> lines. Dismissing the rest of the army, King <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> stayed behind with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>300 Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Thermopylae</b></span> and 700 Thespian volunteers. Though they knew it meant their own deaths, they secured the retreat of the other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> forces.
<br>
<br>The losses of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army alarmed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>. When his navy was later defeated at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> he fled <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> leaving only part of his force to finish the conquest of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. It was defeated at the Battle of Plataea.The performance of the defenders at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> is often used as an example of the advantages of training, equipment and good use of terrain to maximize an army's potential, as well as a symbol of courage against overwhelming odds. The heroic sacrifice of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thespians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thespiae</b></span> has captured the minds of many throughout the ages and has given birth to many cultural references as a result.
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> says:The force with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> was sent forward by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> in advance of their main body, that the sight of them might encourage the allies to fight, and hinder them from going over to the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>, as was likely they might have done had they seen that <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> was backward.
<br>
<br>They intended presently, when they had celebrated the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Carneian Festival</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Carnea</b></span>, which was what now kept them at home, to leave a garrison in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, and hasten in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>full force</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Full_Force</b></span> to join the army. The rest of the allies intended to act similarly; for it happened that the Olympic Festival fell exactly at this same period. None of them looked to see the contest at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> decided so speedily; wherefore they were content to send forward a mere advance guard. Such accordingly were the intentions of the allies.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> the Spartan king was put in charge of the army at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>. Of his over lordship <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> says only that they especially looked up to him. He was convinced that he was going to certain death, which he would not have been if he had thought the forces given him were adequate for a victory. He selected only men who had fathered sons that were old enough to take over the family responsibilities.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> mentions in his Sayings of Spartan Women that after encouraging her husband before his departure for the battlefield, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Gorgo</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gorgon</b></span>, the wife of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>, asked him what she should do when he had left. To this he replied: Marry a good man, and have many good children. Another common saying of Spartan Women was: Come home with your shield or on it. The meaning being that the soldier was to return home either victorious (with your shield) or dead - i.e. carried away from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> field (on their shield), rather than fleeing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> and dropping their shield in cowardice (as it was too heavy a piece of armor to carry while running).
<br>Topography of the battlefield. At the time, the pass of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> consisted of a track along the shore of the Gulf of Malis so narrow that only one <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>chariot</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chariot</b></span> could pass through. On the southern side of the track stood the cliffs, while on the north side was the gulf. Along the path was a series of three constrictions, or "gates" (pylai), and at the center gate a short wall that had been erected by the Phobias in the previous century to aid in their defense against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thessalian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thessaly</b></span> invasions.
<br>
<br>The name "hot gates" comes from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hot springs</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hot_spring</b></span> that were located there. Today the pass is not that, but is inland, due to infilling of the Gulf of Malis. The old track appears at the foot of hills around the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>plain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Plain</b></span>, flanked by a modern road. It still is a natural defensive position to modern armies.
<br>
<br>When the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span> were being roughly handled, they were retreating, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, whom the king was calling immortals, having shown themselves forth, were advancing, of whom the first was <span style='color: blue'><b>Hydarnes</b></span>. It was thought that they would accomplish victory. But when they were battling the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, they were bearing no more success than the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>, but the same results. For fighting in a small passage, they could not make use of their number, and using smaller spears, could not engage the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> with success.
<br>
<br>And turning their backs, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> would flee convincingly, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> would advance with a shout and a din. The triumphing ones would turn to be the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, and the ones having turned themselves were holding off the greater number of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. A few of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> were falling due to the superiority of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> force, but the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were not able to take hold of the pass. It is said that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>, looking on, jumped from his seat three times in fear for his army.
<br>
<br>​On the following day, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were contending no more successfully. With some of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> surviving, (the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>) hoping that they (The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>), having been covered in wounds, would not be able to raise their hands (to fight), attacked again; but having been arranged by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>clan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Clan</b></span> and company, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> were surviving, and each one was fighting in share, except for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phocians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis</b></span>, who were guarding the other pass.
<br>Late on the second day of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, as the king was pondering what to do next, he received a windfall circumstance: a Malian, named <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ephialtes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephialtes_of_Trachis</b></span>, informed him of a path around <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> and offered to guide them. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ephialtes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephialtes_of_Trachis</b></span> was motivated by the desire of a reward, though he was later assassinated. The path led from east of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> camp along the ridge of Mt. Anopaea behind the cliffs that flanked the pass. It branched, one path leading to <span style='color: blue'><b>Phocis</b></span>, and the other down to the Gulf of Malis at Alpenus, first town of <span style='color: blue'><b>Locris</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> had stationed 1000 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phocian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis</b></span> volunteers on the heights to guard this path..
<br>
<br>For all their previous indignation and insistence on a defense at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, they were not prepared: there were no advance positions, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sentinels</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Factions_of_Halo</b></span> or patrols. Their first warning of the approach of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Immortals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Immortality</b></span> under <span style='color: blue'><b>Hydarnes</b></span> was the rustling of oak leaves at first light on the third day of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> says that they "jumped up", suggesting that they were still asleep, and were "greatly <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>amazed</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Amazed</b></span>", which no alert unit should have been. <span style='color: blue'><b>Hydarnes</b></span> was as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>amazed</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Amazed</b></span> to see them hastily arming themselves. He feared that they were <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, but was enlightened by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ephialtes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephialtes_of_Trachis</b></span>. Not wishing to be delayed by an assault, <span style='color: blue'><b>Hydarnes</b></span> resorted to a tactic that later turned out to be the winning one: he fired "showers of arrows" at them. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phocians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis</b></span> retreated to the crest of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mountain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mountain_gun</b></span>, there to make a last stand (their story). <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> branched left to Alpenus. For this act, the name of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ephialtes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephialtes_of_Trachis</b></span> received a lasting stigma: it means "nightmare" and is synonymous with "traitor" in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>
<br>
<br>After several days of fighting, Magistias, a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>seer</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Oracle</b></span>", inspected the entrails of an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>animal sacrifice</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Animal_sacrifice</b></span>. It was custom of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> to slice an animals underside and inspect its internal organs. By the shape and color of the organs of the sacrifice, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> would determine whether the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> would end favorably for them (or not). On this day, however, Magistias inspected the sacrifice, and he told the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> in <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> that death was destined to them at dawn. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, however, were unfazed by this <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>grim</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Church_grim</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>omen</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Omen</b></span>.
<br>
<br>They were less concerned about living or dying, than they were with how many <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> they killed (apparently, this bad <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>omen</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Omen</b></span> was referring to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ephialtes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephialtes_of_Trachis</b></span> and his betrayal of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>). He was leading a large group of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> through a "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cow</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cattle</b></span> path" which was really unknown to many. This path would lead the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> behind the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lacedemonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Laconia</b></span>, ergo allowing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> to fight on both sides of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lacedemonians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Laconia</b></span>. Many of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> were arguing not to stay and fight the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> because it was suicidal, so <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> himself dismissed them. However the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thespians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thespiae</b></span>, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thebes,_Greece</b></span> alone were staying to fight. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thebes,_Greece</b></span> were not wanting to fight but <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> was holding them hostage by their word. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thespians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thespiae</b></span> however, declared that they would not leave <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> behind and that they would fight to the death beside him and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>. Demophilius, son of Diadromes, was the general of them. This section has been translated from <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, and then explained by Mr. Gregory J <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Knittel</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Gustav_Knittel</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ph.D.</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Doctor_of_Philosophy</b></span>
<br>
<br>Final stand of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thespians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thespiae</b></span>: None of the actions of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were a surprise to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>. From a variety of sources he was kept apprised of their every move, receiving first <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>intelligence</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Espionage</b></span> of the outflanking movement before first light. When he learned that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phocians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phocis</b></span> had not held, he called a council. It was just at dawn.Some of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> wished to depart, and some to stay. At the end of the council some departed.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> believed that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> blessed their departure with an order, but he related the other point of view, that they departed without orders. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> had pledged themselves to fight to the death, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thebes,_Greece</b></span> were held as hostage against their will. However, a contingent of about 700 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thespians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thespiae</b></span>, led by general <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Demophilus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Demophilus_of_Thespiae</b></span>, the son of Diadromes, refused to leave with the other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, but cast in their lot with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>. Ostensibly the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> were obeying their oath and following the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oracle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delphi</b></span> from <span style='color: blue'><b>Delphi</b></span>.
<br>
<br>However, it would have been good generalship to delay the advance of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> and cover the retreat of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army; in fact, with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> so close at hand, it probably was a tactical requirement, made more palatable by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oracle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delphi</b></span>. At dawn <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> made libations, waited until he thought the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Immortals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Immortality</b></span> had time to descend the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mountain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mountain_gun</b></span>, and then began to advance. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> this time sallied out from the wall to meet them in the wider part of the pass with a view toward slaughtering as many as they could. This they succeeded in doing. They fought with spears until the spears were all shattered and then switched to xiphoi (short swords). In this struggle <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> tells us that two brothers of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> fell, <span style='color: blue'><b>Abrocomes</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Hyperanthes</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span> also died in the assault. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fought for his body, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> winning. Receiving <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>intelligence</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Espionage</b></span> that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ephialtes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ephialtes_of_Trachis</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Immortals</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Immortality</b></span> were coming up, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> withdrew and took a stand on a small hill " <span style='color: blue'><b>Kolonos</b></span>" behind the wall. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thebans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thebes,_Greece</b></span> under Leontiades put hands up, but a few were slain before the surrender was accepted.  Some of the remaining <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> were fighting with their hands and teeth. Tearing down part of the wall, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> ordered the hill surrounded and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rained down arrows until the last <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> was dead.

This was very uncommon for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>: they had the habit of treating enemies that fought bravely against them with great honor, as the example of Asonides captured earlier off <span style='color: blue'><b>Skyros</b></span> shows. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> was known for his rages, as when he had the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> whipped because it would not obey him. After the departure and defeat of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> collected their dead and buried them on the hill. A stone lion was erected to commemorate <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>. Forty years after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Leonidas</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Leonidas_I</b></span>' body was returned from <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> to <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, where he was buried again with full honors and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>funeral games</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Funeral_games</b></span> were held every year.The simultaneous naval Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span> was a draw, whereupon the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> navy retreated. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> had control of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean Sea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span> and all of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> as far south as <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>; the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> prepared to defend the Isthmus of <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>, while <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> sacked <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, whose inhabitants had already fled to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>
