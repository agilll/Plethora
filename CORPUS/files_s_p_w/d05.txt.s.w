Thermopylae, Greek_language Thermopýles, also spelled Thermopílai, narrow pass on the east coast of central Ancient_Greece between the Kallídhromon Massif and the Gulf of Maliakós, about 85 miles (136 km) northwest of Classical_Athens (Athína). In Ancient_Greece its cliffs were by the sea, but silting has widened the distance to more than a mile. Its name, meaning hot gates, is derived from its hot Sulfur springs.

The pass, some 4 miles (6 km) in length, has figured in numerous invasions. There, in August 480 Common_Era, during the second Achaemenid_Empire invasion of Ancient_Greece, a small Ancient_Greece force under the Spartan king Leonidas_I defended Attica and Boeotia against the southward advance of Xerxes_I’ Achaemenid_Empire army while Ancient_Greece fleets at nearby Cape Artemesium fought off the attacking Achaemenid_Empire navy. Leonidas_I’s troops held the pass for three days until the Achaemenid_Empire, guided along another Mountain pass by the Ancient_Greece traitor Ephialtes_of_Trachis, outflanked them. Sending the majority of his troops to safety, Leonidas_I remained to delay the Achaemenid_Empire with Battle_of_Thermopylae, their Helots, and 1,100 Boeotia, all of whom died in Battle. Although the Achaemenid_Empire won at Thermopylae and conquered central Ancient_Greece, they suffered considerable losses in the Battle, and most of the Ancient_Greece troops and ships were able to escape to the Isthmus of Corinth to rejoin the main Ancient_Greece forces. This Battle became celebrated in history and literature as an example of heroic resistance against great odds. A large Marble and bronze monument commemorating the Battle was erected in 1955. In 279 Common_Era the Ancient_Greece delayed the invading Celtic_settlement_of_Eastern_Europe at Thermopylae, and in 191 Common_Era the Seleucid_Empire king Antiochus_III_the_Great fortified the pass against the Roman_Republic
