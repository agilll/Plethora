Astyages (spelled by Herodotus as Ἀστυάγης Astyages; by Ctesias as Astyigas; by Diodorus as Aspadas; Babylon: Ištumegu) was the last king of the Median Empire, r. 585–550 Common_Era, the son of Cyaxares; he was dethroned in 550 Common_Era by Cyrus_the_Great. His name derives from the Iranian_languages Rishti Vaiga, which means "swinging the spear, lance-hurler."[1] In the inscriptions of Nabonidus the name is written Ishtuvegu.[2]

Astyages succeeded his father in 585 Common_Era, following the Battle of Halys, which ended a five-year war between the Lydia and the Medes. He inherited a large empire, ruled in alliance with his two brothers-in-law, Croesus of Lydia and Nebuchadnezzar_II of Babylon, whose wife, Amytis_of_Media, Astyages' sister, was the queen for whom Nebuchadnezzar_II was said to have built the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.[3] However, due to recent evidence, the garden was likely built by the Assyria King Sennacherib. Married to Aryenis, the sister of King Croesus of Lydia, to Cylinder_seal the treaty between the two empires, Astyages ascended to the Medes throne upon his father's death later that year.[4]

The ancient sources report almost nothing about Astyages’ reign, and a final judgment on his character is not possible, since Herodotus’ negative account (Astyages is represented as a cruel and despotic ruler) and Ctesias’ favorable one, are both biased.[5] According to Cyropaedia of Xenophon, after thirty-two years of relative stability, Astyages lost the support of his nobles during the war against Cyrus_the_Great, whom Xenophon understands as being Astyages' grandson. This resulted in the founding of the Achaemenid_Empire empire by Cyrus_the_Great.[6]

The account given by the Ancient_Greece historian Herodotus relates that Astyages had a dream in which his daughter, Mandane, gave birth to a son who would destroy his empire. Fearful of the dream's prophecy, Astyages married her off to Cambyses_I of Anshan_(Persia), who had a reputation for being a "quiet and thoughtful prince" and whom Astyages believed to be no threat. When a second dream warned Astyages of the dangers of Mandane's offspring, Astyages sent his general Harpagus to kill the child Cyrus_the_Great. Herodotus correctly names Cyrus_the_Great' parents, though he fails to mention that Cambyses_I was a king.[7][8] Modern scholarship generally rejects his claim that Cyrus_the_Great was the grandson of Astyages.[9] Harpagus, unwilling to spill royal Food_and_drink_prohibitions, gave the infant to a shepherd, Mitridates, whose wife had just given birth to a Stillbirth child. Mitridates, or Mithridates_VI_of_Pontus, is connected to Mithra (compare Faustulus) who discovered Romulus_and_Remus and Romulus_and_Remus, and his connection with Faunus.[citation needed] Cyrus_the_Great was raised as Mitridates' own son, and Harpagus presented the Stillbirth child to Astyages as the dead Cyrus_the_Great. When Cyrus_the_Great was found alive at age ten, Astyages spared the boy on the advice of his Magi, returning him to his parents in Anshan. Harpagus, however, did not escape punishment, as Astyages is said to have fed him his own son at a banquet. Cyrus_the_Great succeeded his father in 559, and in 553, on the advice of Harpagus, who was eager for revenge for being given the "abominable supper," Cyrus_the_Great rebelled against Astyages. After three years of fighting, Astyages' troops mutinied during the Battle of Pasargadae, and Cyrus_the_Great conquered the Medes's empire. Astyages was spared by Cyrus_the_Great, and despite being taunted by Harpagus, Herodotus says he was treated well and remained in Cyrus_the_Great' court until his death. Rather than giving the popular Greek_mythology that Cyrus_the_Great was suckled by a Dog, the Dog was sacred to Achaemenid_Empire. cf. also the legend of Sargon_II, or the similar legend of Romulus_and_Remus and Romulus_and_Remus, suckled by a Lupercal. (Latins: Lupa) Herodotus explains that the herdsman Mitridates lived with another of Astyages' slaves, a woman named 'Spaco,' which he explains is Medes for "Dog."[10][11] gives both the legend and Herodotus' rationalized version.[12]

The contemporary Chronicle of Nabonidus refers to the Mutiny on the battlefield as the cause for Astyages' overthrow, but does not mention Harpagus by name. However, since Harpagus was Astyages' general at the Battle of Pasargadae and his family were granted high positions in Cyrus_the_Great' empire after the war, and since Harpagus went on to become Cyrus_the_Great' most successful general, it is possible he had something to do with the Mutiny against Astyages.[13] Cyrus_the_Great then went on to capture Astyages' capital of Ecbatana. Ancient sources agree that after Astyages was taken by Cyrus_the_Great he was treated with Pardon, though the accounts differ. Herodotus says that Cyrus_the_Great kept Astyages at his court during the remainder of his life, while according to Ctesias, he was made a governor of a region of Parthia and was later murdered by a political opponent, Oebaras. The circumstances of Astyages' death are not known. After Astyages' overthrow, Croesus marched on Cyrus_the_Great to avenge Astyages. Cyrus_the_Great, with Harpagus at his side, defeated Croesus and conquered Lydia in or after 547 Common_Era
