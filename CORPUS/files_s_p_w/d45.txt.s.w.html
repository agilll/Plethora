The Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span> (/ˈsæləmɪs/; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ancient Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>: Ναυμαχία τῆς Σαλαμῖνος, <span style='color: blue'><b>Naumachia</b></span> tēs Salaminos) was a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>naval battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naval_warfare</b></span> fought between an alliance of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states under <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> and the Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>King Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>0 BC which resulted in a decisive victory for the outnumbered <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> was fought in the straits between the mainland and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>, an island in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Saronic Gulf</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Saronic_Gulf</b></span> near <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, and marked the high-point of the second <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.
<br>
<br>To block the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> advance, a small force of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> blocked the pass of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, while an Athenian-dominated <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> navy engaged the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet in the nearby straits of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span>. In the resulting Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, the rearguard of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> force was annihilated, whilst in the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> had heavy losses and retreated after the loss at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>. This allowed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> to conquer <span style='color: blue'><b>Phocis</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> prepared to defend the Isthmus of <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> whilst the fleet was withdrawn to nearby <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Although heavily outnumbered, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> were persuaded by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> general <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> to bring the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> again, in the hope that a victory would prevent naval operations against the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>king Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>lso eager for a decisive <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>. As a result of subterfuge on the part of <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> navy rowed into the Straits of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span> and tried to block both entrances. In the cramped conditions of the Straits, the great <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> numbers were an active hindrance, as ships struggled to maneuver and became disorganized. Seizing the opportunity, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet formed in line and scored a decisive victory.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> retreated to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> with much of his army, leaving <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> to complete the conquest of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. However, the following year, the remainder of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army was decisively beaten at the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> navy at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> made no further attempts to conquer the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> mainland. These battles of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> thus mark a turning point in the course of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> as a whole; from then onward, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>poleis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Polis</b></span> would take the offensive. A number of historians believe that a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> victory would have hamstrung the development of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ancient Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, and by extension <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>western civilization</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Western_world</b></span>, and this has led them to argue that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span> is one of the most significant battles in human history.[5]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>main source</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Main_Source</b></span> for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> is the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, who has been called the 'Father of History',[6] was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> (then under <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> overlordship). He wrote his Enquiries (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>: Ιστορίαι; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>English</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kingdom_of_England</b></span>: (The) <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span>) around 440–430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian Wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ending in 450 BC).[7] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented "history" as we know it.[7] As <span style='color: blue'><b>Holland</b></span> has it: "For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>manifest destiny</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Manifest_destiny</b></span>, but rather explanations he could verify personally."[7]
<br>
<br>Some subsequent ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, starting with <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span>.[8][9] Nevertheless, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> chose to begin his history where <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> left off (at the Siege of Sestos), and therefore evidently felt that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting.[9] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> criticised <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> in his essay "On the Malignity of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>", describing <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> as "Philobarbaros" (barbarian-lover), for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed.[10] A negative view of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> was passed on to <span style='color: blue'><b>Renaissance</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>, though he remained well read.[11] However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaeological finds which have repeatedly confirmed his version of events.[12] The prevailing modern view is that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> generally did a remarkable job in his Historia, but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>skepticism</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Skepticism</b></span>.[12] Nevertheless, there are still some historians who believe <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> made up much of his story.[13]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Sicilian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Sicilian</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Diodorus Siculus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Diodorus_Siculus</b></span>, writing in the 1st century BC in his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Bibliotheca Historica</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bibliotheca_historica</b></span>, also provides an account of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>, partially derived from the earlier <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephorus</b></span>. This account is fairly consistent with <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s.[14] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span> are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Ctesias</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cnidus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Knidos</b></span>, and are alluded by other authors, such as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>playwright</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Theatre</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeschylus</b></span>. Archaeological evidence, such as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Serpent Column</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Serpent_Column</b></span>, also supports some of <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s specific claims.[15]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span> had supported the unsuccessful <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian Revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> against the Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> in 499-494 BC, led by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>satrap</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Satrap</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Miletus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Aristagoras</b></span>. The Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> was still relatively young, and prone to revolts amongst its subject peoples.[16][17] Moreover, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> was a usurper, and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule.[16] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionian_Revolt</b></span> threatened the integrity of his empire, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> thus vowed to punish those involved (especially those not already part of the empire).[18][19] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> also saw the opportunity to expand his empire into the fractious world of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ancient Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[19] A preliminary expedition under <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span>, in 492 BC, to secure the land approaches to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> ended with the re-conquest of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span> and forced <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span> to become a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>client kingdom</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Client_state</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[20]
<br>
<br>In 491 BC, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> sent emissaries to all the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states, asking for a gift of 'earth and water' in token of their submission to him.[21] Having had a demonstration of his power the previous year, the majority of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities duly obliged. In <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, however, the ambassadors were put on trial and then executed; in <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>, they were simply thrown down a well.[21] This meant that <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> was also now effectively at war with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[21]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> thus put together an amphibious task force under Datis and <span style='color: blue'><b>Artaphernes</b></span> in 490 BC, which attacked <span style='color: blue'><b>Naxos</b></span>, before receiving the submission of the other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cycladic Islands</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyclades</b></span>. The task force then moved on <span style='color: blue'><b>Eretria</b></span>, which it besieged and destroyed.[22] Finally, it moved to attack <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, landing at the bay of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, where it was met by a heavily outnumbered <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> army. At the ensuing Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>, the Athenians won a remarkable victory, which resulted in the withdrawal of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>.[23]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> therefore began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>; however, in 486 BC, his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> expedition.[17] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> then died whilst preparing to march on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</b></span>, and the throne of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> passed to his son <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>.[24] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> crushed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian revolt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemy_V_Epiphanes</b></span>, and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[25] Since this was to be a full-scale invasion, it required long-term planning, stock-piling and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>conscription</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Conscription</b></span>.[25] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> decided that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> would be bridged to allow his army to cross to <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>, and that a canal should be dug across the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>isthmus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Isthmus_of_Corinth</b></span> of Mount <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mount_Athos</b></span> (rounding which <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>headland</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Headlands_and_bays</b></span>, a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC).[26] These were both feats of exceptional ambition, which would have been beyond any other contemporary state.[26] By early 480 BC, the preparations were complete, and the army which <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> had mustered at <span style='color: blue'><b>Sardis</b></span> marched towards <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>, crossing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> on two pontoon bridges.[27]
<br>
<br>The Athenians had also been preparing for war with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> since the mid-<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>480s BC</span> <span style='color: green'><b>480s_BC</b></span>, and in 482 BC the decision was taken, under the guidance of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> politician <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, to build a massive fleet of triremes that would be necessary for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> to fight the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[28] However, the Athenians did not have the manpower to fight on land and sea; and therefore combatting the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> would require an alliance of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> states. In 481 BC, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> sent ambassadors around <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> asking for earth and water, but made the very deliberate omission of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span>.[29] Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states. A congress of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> states met at <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>late autumn</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Late_Autumn_(1960_film)</b></span> of 481 BC,[30] and a confederate alliance of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states was formed. It had the power to send envoys asking for assistance and to dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points after joint consultation. This was remarkable for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>disjointed</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Disjointed</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> world, especially since many of the city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.[31]

<br>Initially the 'congress' agreed to defend the narrow Vale of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tempe</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Vale_of_Tempe</b></span>, on the borders of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thessaly</b></span>, and thereby block <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>'s advance.[32] However, once there, they were warned by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Alexander</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Alexander_the_Great</b></span> I of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span> that the vale could be bypassed through the pass by the modern village of <span style='color: blue'><b>Sarantaporo</b></span>, and that the army of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> was overwhelming, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> retreated.[33] Shortly afterwards, they received the news that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> had crossed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span>. A second strategy was therefore adopted by the allies. The route to southern <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> (<span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>) would require the army of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> to travel through the very narrow pass of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>. This could easily be blocked by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>, despite the overwhelming numbers of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. Furthermore, to prevent the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> bypassing <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> by sea, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and allied navies could block the straits of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span>. This dual strategy was adopted by the congress.[34] However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> should it come to it, whilst the women and children of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> had been evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Troezen</b></span>.[35]
<br>
<br>Famously, the much smaller <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army held the pass of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> for three days before being outflanked by a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mountain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mountain_warfare</b></span> path. Much of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army retreated, before the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Thespians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Thespiae</b></span> who had continued to block the pass were surrounded and killed.[36] The simultaneous Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span> was up to that point a stalemate;[37] however, when news of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> reached them, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet also retreated, since holding the straits of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span> was now a moot point.[38]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet now rowed from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span> to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span> to assist with the final evacuation of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>. En route <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> left inscriptions addressed to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> crews of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet on all springs of water that they might stop at, asking them to defect to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> cause.[39] Following <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army proceeded to burn and sack the Boeotian cities that had not surrendered, <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Thespiae</b></span>, before marching on the now evacuated <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>.[40] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> (mostly Peloponnesian) prepared to defend the Isthmus of <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span>, demolishing the single road that led through it, and building a wall across it.[41]
<br>
<br>This strategy was flawed, however, unless the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet was able to prevent the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet from transporting troops across the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Saronic Gulf</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Saronic_Gulf</b></span>. In a council-of-war called once the evacuation of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> was complete, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Corinth</b></span> naval commander <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Adeimantus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Adeimantus_of_Collytus</b></span> argued that the fleet should assemble off the coast of the Isthmus in order to achieve such a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>blockade</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Blockade</b></span>.[42] However, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> argued in favour of an offensive strategy, aimed at decisively destroying the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>' naval superiority. He drew on the lessons of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span>, pointing out that "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> in close conditions works to our advantage".[42] He eventually won through, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> navy remained off the coast of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>.[43]
<br>
<br>The time-line for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span> is difficult to establish with any certainty.[44] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> presents the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> as though it occurred directly after the capture of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, but nowhere explicitly states as much. If <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>/<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span> occurred in September, then this may be the case, but it is probably more likely that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> spent two or three weeks capturing <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, refitting the fleet, and resupplying.[44] Clearly though, at some point after capturing <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> held a council of war with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet; <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> says this occurred at <span style='color: blue'><b>Phalerum</b></span>.[45] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artemisia_I_of_Caria</b></span>, queen of Halicarnassus and commander of its naval squadron in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>'s fleet, tried to convince him to wait for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> to surrender believing that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> in the straits of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span> was an unnecessary risk.[45] Nevertheless, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> and his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>chief advisor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Chief_Adviser</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> pressed for an attack.[46]
<br>
<br>It is difficult to explain exactly what eventually brought about the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, assuming that neither side simply attacked without forethought.[44] Clearly though, at some point just before the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, new information began to reach <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> of rifts in the allied command; the Peloponnesians wished to evacuate from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span> while they still could.[47] This alleged <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>rift</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Rift</b></span> amongst the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> may have simply been a ruse, in order to lure the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>.[48] Alternatively, this change in attitude amongst the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> (who had waited patiently off the coast of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span> for at least a week while <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> was captured) may have been in response to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> offensive maneuvers.[44] Possibly, a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army had been sent to march against the Isthmus in order to test the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>nerve</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nerve_agent</b></span> of the fleet.[44][48]
<br>
<br>Either way, when <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> received this news, he ordered his fleet to go out on patrol off the coast <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>, blocking the southern exit.[48] Then, at dusk, he ordered them to withdraw, possibly in order to tempt the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> into a hasty evacuation.[48] That evening <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> now attempted what appears to have been a spectacularly successful use of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>disinformation</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Disinformation</b></span>. He sent a servant, <span style='color: blue'><b>Sicinnus</b></span>, to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>, with a message proclaiming that <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> was "on the king's side and prefers that your affairs prevail, not the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>".[49] <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> claimed that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> command was in-fighting, that the Peloponnesians were planning to evacuate that very night, and that to gain victory all the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> need to do was to block the straits.[49] In performing this subterfuge, <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> seems to have been trying to bring about exactly the opposite; to lure the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet into the Straits.[48] This was exactly the kind of news that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> wanted to hear; that the Athenians might be willing to submit to him, and that he would be able to destroy the rest of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet.[48] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> evidently took the bait, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet was sent out that evening to effect this block.[50] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> ordered a throne to be set up on the slopes of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mount Aigaleo</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mount_Aigaleo</b></span> (overlooking the straits), in order to watch the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> from a clear vantage point, and so as to record the names of commanders who performed particularly well.[51]
<br>
<br>According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> spent the evening heatedly debating their course of action.[52] The Peloponnesians were in favour of evacuating,[53] and at this point <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> attempted his ruse with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>.[49] It was only when Aristides, the exiled <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> general arrived that night, followed by some deserters from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, with news of the deployment of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet,[54][55] that the Peloponnesians accepted that they could not escape, and so would fight.[56]
<br>
<br>However, Peloponnesians may have been party to <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s stratagem, so serenely did they accept that they would now have to fight at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>.[57] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> navy was thus able to prepare properly for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> the forthcoming day, whilst the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> spent the night fruitlessly at sea, searching for the alleged <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> evacuation. The next morning, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rowed into the straits to attack the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet; it is not clear when, why or how this decision was made, but it is clear that they did take the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span>.[51]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> reports that there were 378 triremes in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet, and then breaks the numbers down by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> state (as indicated in the table).[58] However, his numbers for the individual contingents only add up to 371. He does not explicitly say that all 378 fought at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span> ("All of these came to the war providing triremes...The total number of ships...was three hundred and seventy-eight"),[1] and he also says that the Aeginetans "had other manned ships, but they guarded their own land with these and fought at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span> with the thirty most seaworthy".[59] Thus it has been supposed that the difference between the numbers is accounted for by a garrison of 12 ships left at <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span>.[60] According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, two more ships defected from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, one before <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span> and one before <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>, so the total complement at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span> would have been 373 (or 380).[61]
<br>
<br>According to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>playwright</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Theatre</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeschylus</b></span>, who actually fought at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet numbered 310 triremes (the difference being the number of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> ships).[62] <span style='color: blue'><b>Ctesias</b></span> claims that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> fleet numbered only 110 triremes, which ties in with <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeschylus</b></span>'s numbers.[63] According to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hyperides</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hypereides</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet numbered only 220.[64] The fleet was effectively under the command of <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, but nominally led by the Spartan nobleman <span style='color: blue'><b>Eurybiades</b></span>, as had been agreed at the congress in 481 BC.[65] Although <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> had tried to claim leadership of the fleet, the other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> states with navies objected, and so <span style='color: blue'><b>Sparta</b></span> (which had no naval tradition) was given command of the fleet as a compromise.[65]
<br>
<br>According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet initially numbered 1,207 triremes.[71] However, by his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>reckoning</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Devil_(Dungeons_&_Dragons)</b></span> they lost approximately a third of these ships in a storm off the coast of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Magnesia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Magnesia</b></span>,[72] 200 more in a storm off the coast of <span style='color: blue'><b>Euboea</b></span>,[73] and at least 50 ships to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> action at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span>.[73][74] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> claims that these losses were replaced in full,[75] but only mentions 120 ships from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span> and nearby islands as reinforcements.[76] <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeschylus</b></span>, who fought at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>, also claims that he faced 1,207 warships there, of which 207 were "fast ships".[77] Diodorus[78] and <span style='color: blue'><b>Lysias</b></span>[79] independently claim there were 1,200 ships in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet assembled at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Doriskos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Doriscus</b></span> in the spring of 480 BC. The number of 1,207 (for the outset only) is also given by <span style='color: blue'><b>Ephorus</b></span>,[80] while his teacher <span style='color: blue'><b>Isocrates</b></span> claims there were 1,300 at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Doriskos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Doriscus</b></span> and 1,200 at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>.[81][82] <span style='color: blue'><b>Ctesias</b></span> gives another number, 1,000 ships,[63] while <span style='color: blue'><b>Plato</b></span>, speaking in general terms refers to 1,000 ships and more.[83]
<br>
<br>The number 1,207 appears very early in the historical record (472 BC), and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> appear to have genuinely believed they faced that many ships. Because of the consistency in the ancient sources, some modern historians are inclined to accept 1,207 as the size of the initial <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet;[84][85][86] others reject this number, with 1,207 being seen as more of a reference to the combined <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet in the <span style='color: blue'><b>Iliad</b></span>, and generally claim that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span>.[86][87][88] However, very few appear to accept that there were this many ships at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>: most favour a number in the range 600-800.[2][3][4] This is also the range given by adding the approximate number of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> ships after <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span> (~550) to the reinforcements (120) quantified by <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>.[76]
<br>
<br>The overall <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> strategy for the invasion of 480 BC was to overwhelm the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> with a massive invasion force, and complete the conquest of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> in a single campaigning season.<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>[89</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Effects_of_Hurricane_Sandy_in_New_York</b></span>] Conversely, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> sought to make the best use of their numbers by defending restricted locations and to keep the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> in the field for as long as possible. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> had obviously not anticipated such resistance, or he would have arrived earlier in the campaigning season (and not waited 4 days at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> to disperse).[90] <span style='color: blue'><b>Time</b></span> was now of the essence for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> – the huge invasion force could not be reasonably supported indefinitely, nor probably did <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> wish to be at the fringe of his empire for so long.[91] <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> had shown that a frontal assault against a well defended <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> position was useless; with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> now dug in across the narrow Isthmus, there was little chance of conquering the rest of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> by land.[92] However, as equally demonstrated by <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, if the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> could be outflanked, their smaller numbers of troops could be destroyed.[93] Such an outflanking of the Isthmus required the use of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> navy, and thus the destruction of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> navy. Therefore, if <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> could destroy the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> navy, he would be in a strong position to force a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> surrender; this seemed the only hope of concluding the campaign in that season.[91] Conversely by avoiding destruction, or as <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> hoped, by crippling the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> could effectively thwart the invasion.[94]
<br>
<br>However, it was strategically not necessary for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> to actually fight this <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>.[93] According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, Queen <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artemisia_I_of_Caria</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Caria</b></span> pointed this out to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> in the run-up to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artemisia_I_of_Caria</b></span> suggested that fighting at sea was an unnecessary risk, recommending instead:
<br>
<br>If you do not hurry to fight at sea, but keep your ships here and stay near land, or even advance into the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>, then, my lord, you will easily accomplish what you had in mind on coming here. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellenes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> are not able to hold out against you for a long time, but you will scatter them, and they will each flee to their own cities.[95]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet was still large enough to both bottle up the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> navy in the straits of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>, and send ships to land troops in the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>.[93] However, in the final <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>reckoning</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Devil_(Dungeons_&_Dragons)</b></span>, both sides were prepared to stake everything on a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>naval battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naval_warfare</b></span>, in the hope of decisively altering the course of the war.[94]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> were at a significant tactical advantage, outnumbering the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span>, and also having "better sailing" ships.[96] The "better sailing" that <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> mentions was probably due to the superior seamanship of the crews;[96] most of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> ships (and therefore the majority of the fleet) were newly built as according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>' request to the Athenians to build a fleet of 200 triremes in 483 BC, and had inexperienced crews. It is important to note that despite the inexperienced crew on part of the Athenians, these newly constructed triremes would ultimately prove crucial in the forthcoming conflict with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[97] The most common <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>naval tactics</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sailing_ship_tactics</b></span> in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mediterranean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mediterranean_Sea</b></span> area at the time were ramming (triremes being equipped with a ram at the bows), or boarding by ship-borne marines (which essentially turned a sea <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> into a land one).[98] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> and Asiatic <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> had by this time begun to use a manoeuver known as diekplous. It is not entirely clear what this was, but it probably involved rowing into gaps between enemy ships and then ramming them in the side.[98] This maneuver would have required skilled crews, and therefore the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> would have been more likely to employ it; the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> however, developed tactics specifically to counter this.[98]
<br>
<br>There has been much debate as to the nature of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet compared to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet. Much of this centres on the suggestion, from <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> ships were heavier, and by implication less maneuverable.[99] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The source</span> <span style='color: green'><b>List_of_Charmed_characters</b></span> of this heaviness is uncertain; possibly the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> ships were bulkier in construction, or that the ships were water-logged since they had not been dried out in the winter (though there is no real evidence for either suggestion).[98] Another suggestion is that the heaviness was caused by the weight of fully armored <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> marines (20 fully armored <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> would have weighed 2 tons).[98] This 'heaviness', whatever its cause, would further reduce the likelihood of them employing the diekplous.[98] It is therefore probable that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> had extra marines on board if their ships were less maneuverable, since boarding would then be the main tactic available to them (at the cost of making the ships even heavier).[98] Indeed, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> refers to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> capturing ships at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span>, rather than sinking them.[74] It has been suggested that the weight of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> ships may also have made them more stable in the winds off the coast of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>, and made them less susceptible to ramming (or rather, less liable to sustain damage when rammed).[100]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> preferred a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> in the open sea, where they could better utilize their superior seamanship and numbers.[51] For the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, the only realistic hope of a decisive victory was to draw the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> into a constricted area, where their numbers would count for little.[42] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisium</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Artemisium</b></span> had seen attempts to negate the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> advantage in numbers, but ultimately the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> may have realised that they needed an even more constricted channel in order to defeat the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>.[101] Therefore, by rowing into the Straits of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span> to attack the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were playing into the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span>' hands. It seems probable that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> would not have attempted this unless the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were confident of the collapse of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> navy, and thus <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>'s subterfuge appears to have played a key role in tipping the balance in the favor of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[51] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span> was, for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, an unnecessary <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> and a strategic mistake.[93]

<br>
<br>In the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet, the Athenians were on the left, and on the right were probably the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span> (although Diodorus says it was the Megareans and Aeginetians); the other contingents were in the center.[103][104] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet probably formed into two ranks, since the straits would have been too narrow for a single line of ships.[105] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> has the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet in a line running north-south, probably with the northern flank off the coast of modern-day <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Saint George</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Saint_George</b></span>'s Islet (Ayios Georgis), and the southern flank off the coast of Cape Vavari (part of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>).[106] Diodorus suggests the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet was aligned east-west, spanning the straits between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mount Aigaleo</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mount_Aigaleo</b></span>; however, it is unlikely that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> would have rested one of their flanks against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> occupied territory.[106]
<br>
<br>It seems relatively certain that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet was sent out to block the exit from the Straits the evening before the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> clearly believed that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet actually entered the Straits at nightfall, planning to catch the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> as they fled.[107] However, modern historians have greatly debated this point, with some pointing out the difficulties of maneuvering in this confined space by night, and others accepting <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>'s version.[108][109] There are thus two possibilities; that during the night the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> simply blocked the exit to the Straits, and then entered the straits in daylight; or that they entered the straits and positioned themselves for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> during the night.[108][109] Regardless of when they attempted it, it seems likely that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> pivoted their fleet off the tip of Cape Vavari, so that from an initial east-west alignment (blocking the exit), they came round to a north-south alignment (see diagram).[110] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet seems to have been formed into three ranks of ships (according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeschylus</b></span>);[48] with the powerful <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenician</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span> fleet on the right flank next to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mount Aigaleo</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mount_Aigaleo</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> contingent on the left flank and the other contingents in the centre.[103]
<br>
<br>Diodorus says that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> fleet was sent to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>circumnavigate</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Circumnavigation</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>, and block the northern exit from the Straits.[111] If <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> wanted to trap the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> completely, this maneuver would have made sense (especially if he was not expecting the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> to fight).[48] However, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> does not mention this (and possibly alludes to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> presence in the main <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>), leading some modern historians to dismiss it;[110] though again, others accept it as a possibility.[48] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> had also positioned around 400 troops on the island known as <span style='color: blue'><b>Psyttaleia</b></span>, in the middle of the exit from the straits, in order to kill or capture any <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> who ended up there (as a result of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>shipwreck</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Shipwreck</b></span> or grounding).[51]

<br>Regardless of what time they entered the straits, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> did not move to attack the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> until daylight. Since they were not planning to flee after all, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> would have been able to spend the night preparing for <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, and after a speech by <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, the marines boarded and the ships made ready to sail.[56] According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, this was dawn, and as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> "were putting out to sea the barbarians immediately attacked them".[56][112] If the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> only entered the straits at dawn, then the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> would have had the time to take up their station in a more orderly fashion.[108]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Aeschylus</b></span> claims that as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> approached (possibly implying that they were not already in the Straits at dawn), they heard the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> singing their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hymn</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Psalms</b></span> (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>paean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Paean</b></span>) before they saw the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet:

<br>
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> recounts that, according to the Athenians, as the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> began the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Corinth</b></span> hoisted their sails and began sailing away from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, northwards up the straits.[114] However, he also says that other <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> denied this story.[114] If this did in fact occur, one possible interpretation is that these ships had been a decoy sent to reconnoitre the northern exit from the straits, in case the arrival of the encircling <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> detachment was imminent (if indeed this also occurred).[108] Another possibility (not exclusive of the former) is that the departure of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Corinth</b></span> triggered the final approach of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, suggesting as it did that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet was disintegrating.[108] At any rate, if they indeed ever left, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Corinth</b></span> soon returned to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>.[114]
<br>
<br>Approaching the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet in the crowded Straits, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> appear to have become disorganised and cramped in the narrow waters.[104][108] Moreover, it would have become apparent that, far from disintegrating, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet was lined up, ready to attack them.[105][108] However, rather than attacking immediately, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> initially appeared to back their ships away as if in fear.[112] According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>, this was to gain better position, and also in order to gain time until the early morning <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>wind</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Wind</b></span>.[115] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> recounts the legend that as the fleet had backed away, they had seen an apparition of a woman, asking them "Madmen, how far will ye yet back your ships?"[116] However, he more plausibly suggests that whilst the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> were backing water, a single ship shot forward to ram the nearest <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> vessel. The Athenians would claim that this was the ship of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ameinias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ameinias_of_Athens</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pallene</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pallini</b></span>; the Aeginetans would claim it as one of their ships.[112] The whole <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> line then followed suit and made straight for the disordered <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> line.[117]

<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The details</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Details</b></span> of the rest of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> are generally sketchy, and no one involved would have had a view of the entire battlefield.[108] Triremes were generally armed with a large ram at the front, with which it was possible to sink an enemy ship, or at least disable it by shearing off the banks of oars on one side.[98][118] If the initial ramming was not successful, marines boarded the enemy ship and something similar to a land <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> ensued.[98] Both sides had marines on their ships for this eventuality; the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> with fully armed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span>;[108] the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> probably with more lightly armed infantry.[119]

<br>
<br>Across the battlefield, as the first line of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> ships was pushed back by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, they became fouled in the advancing second and third lines of their own ships.[121] On the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek left</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_Left</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>admiral</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Admiral</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Ariabignes</b></span> (a brother of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>)[121] was killed early in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>; left disorganised and leaderless, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenician</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span> squadrons appear to have been pushed back against the coast, many vessels running aground.[108] In the centre, a wedge of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> ships pushed through the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> lines, splitting the fleet in two.[108] According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Ariabignes</b></span> was killed by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ameinias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ameinias_of_Athens</b></span> and Socles (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>: Σωκλής) of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pallene</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pallini</b></span>. When <span style='color: blue'><b>Ariabignes</b></span> attempted to board on their ship, they hit him with their spears, and thrust him into the sea.[122] <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span> also mentions that it was <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artemisia_I_of_Caria</b></span> who recognized <span style='color: blue'><b>Ariabignes</b></span>' body floating among the shipwrecks and brought it back to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>.[123]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> recounts that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artemisia_I_of_Caria</b></span>, the Queen of Halicarnassus, and commander of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Carian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Carians</b></span> contingent, found herself pursued by the ship of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ameinias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ameinias_of_Athens</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Pallene</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pallini</b></span>. In her desire to escape, she attacked and rammed another <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> vessel, thereby convincing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>captain</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sea_captain</b></span> that the ship was an ally; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ameinias</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ameinias_of_Athens</b></span> accordingly abandoned the chase.[124] However, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>, looking on, thought that she had successfully attacked an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> ship, and seeing the poor performance of his other captains commented that "My men have become women, and my women men".[125] The friendly ship she sank was a Calyndian ship and the king of the Calyndians, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Damasithymos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Damasithymus</b></span> (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>: Δαμασίθυμος) was on it.[126][127] None of the crew of the Calyndian ship survived.[128]
<br>
<br>The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet began to retreat towards <span style='color: blue'><b>Phalerum</b></span>, but according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, the Aeginetans ambushed them as they tried to leave the Straits.[129] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The remaining</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Remaining</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> ships limped back to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>harbour</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Harbor</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Phalerum</b></span> and the shelter of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army.[130] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> general Aristides then took a detachment of men across to <span style='color: blue'><b>Psyttaleia</b></span> to slaughter the garrison that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> had left there.[131] The exact <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> casualties are not mentioned by <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>. However, he writes that the next year, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet numbered 300 triremes.[132] The number of losses then depends on the number of ships the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> had to begin with; something in the range of 200–300 seems likely, based on the above estimates for the size of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet. According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> suffered many more casualties than the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> because most <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> did not know how to swim.[121] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>, sitting on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mount Aigaleo</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mount_Aigaleo</b></span> on his throne, witnessed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>carnage</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Carnage_the_Executioner</b></span>.[133] Some ship-wrecked <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenician</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span> captains tried to blame the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> for cowardice before the end of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>.[133] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>, in a foul mood, and having just witnessed an <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> ship capture an Aeginetan ship, had the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenicians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span> beheaded for slandering "more noble men".[133] According to Diodorus, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> "put to death those <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenicians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span> who were chiefly responsible for beginning the flight, and threatened to visit upon the rest the punishment they deserved", causing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenicians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span> to sail to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span> when night fell.[134]
<br>
<br>In the immediate aftermath of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> attempted to build a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>pontoon bridge</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pontoon_bridge</b></span> or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>causeway</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Causeway</b></span> across the straits, in order to use his army to attack the Athenians; however, with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet now confidently patrolling the straits, this proved futile.[90] <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> tells us that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> held a council of war, at which the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> general <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> tried to make light of the defeat:
<br>
<br>Sire, be not grieved nor greatly distressed because of what has befallen us. It is not on things of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>wood</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Wood</b></span> that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then you so desire, let us straightway attack the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>, or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do...It is best then that you should do as I have said, but if you have resolved to lead your army away, even then I have another plan. Do not, O king, make the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> the laughing-stock of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, for if you have suffered harm, it is by no fault of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave men should, and if <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenicians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. It is for me, however, to enslave and deliver Hellas to you with three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.[135]
<br>
<br>Fearing that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> might attack the bridges across the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hellespont</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dardanelles</b></span> and trap his army in <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> resolved to do this, taking the greater part of the army with him.[136] <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> handpicked the troops who were to remain with him in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, taking the elite infantry units and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>cavalry</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cavalry</b></span>, to complete the conquest of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[90] All of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> forces abandoned <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>, however, with <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> over-wintering in <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Thessaly</b></span>; the Athenians were thus able to return to their <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>burnt city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Shahr-e_Sukhteh</b></span> for the winter.[90]
<br>
<br>The following year, 479 BC, <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> recaptured <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> (the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> army still preferring to guard the Isthmus). However, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span>, under Spartan leadership, eventually agreed to try to force <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>, and marched on <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>.[137] <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> retreated to <span style='color: blue'><b>Boeotia</b></span> to lure the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> into open terrain and the two sides eventually met near the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>city</span> <span style='color: green'><b>City</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> (which had been razed the previous year).[137] There, at the Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> army won a decisive victory, destroying much of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army and ending the invasion of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>; whilst at the near-simultaneous Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allied</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> fleet destroyed much of the remaining <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet.[137]

<br>The Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span> marked the turning point in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greco-Persian wars</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greco-Persian_Wars</b></span>.[92] After <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue'><b>Peloponnese</b></span>, and by extension <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> as an entity, was safe from conquest; and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> suffered a major blow to their prestige and morale (as well as severe material losses).[138] At the following battles of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mycale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Mycale</b></span>, the threat of conquest was removed, and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> were able to go on the counter-offensive.[139] The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> victory allowed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Macedonia</b></span> to revolt against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> rule; and over the next 30 years, <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean Islands</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Islands</b></span> and finally <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> would be removed from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> control by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span>, or by the Athenian-dominated successor, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Delian League</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delian_League</b></span>.[140] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span> started a decisive <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>swing</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Swing_bowling</b></span> in the balance of power toward the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, which would culminate in an eventual <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> victory, severely reducing <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> power in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Aegean</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Aegean_Sea</b></span>.[141]
<br>
<br>Like the Battles of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span> has gained something of a 'legendary' status (unlike, for instance, the more decisive Battle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Plataea</b></span>), perhaps because of the desperate circumstances and the unlikely odds.[7] A significant number of historians have stated that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span> is one of the most significant battles in human history (though the same is often stated of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span>).[5][3][100][102] In a more extreme form of this argument, some historians argue that if the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> had lost at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>, the ensuing conquest of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> would have effectively stifled the growth of Western Civilization as we know it.[142] This view is based on the premise that much of modern Western society, such as <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>philosophy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greek_philosophy</b></span>, science, personal freedom and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>democracy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Athenian_democracy</b></span> are rooted in the legacy of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ancient Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.[7] Thus, this school of thought argues that, given the domination of much of modern history by Western Civilization, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> domination of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> might have changed the whole trajectory of human history.[5] It is also worth mentioning that the celebrated blossoming of hugely influential <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> culture occurred only after the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> wars were won.[143][144][145]
<br>
<br>Militarily, it is difficult to draw many lessons from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>, because of the uncertainty about what actually happened. Once again the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Allies</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Allies_of_World_War_II</b></span> chose their ground well in order to negate <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> numbers, but this time (unlike <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>) had to rely on the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> launching an unnecessary attack for their position to count.[93] (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Hale</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hale,_Greater_Manchester</b></span>, John R.). Since it brought about that attack, perhaps the most important military lesson is to be found in the use of deception by <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> to bring about the desired response from the enemy.[93]
<br>
<br>According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Plutarch</b></span>, the previously undistinguished <span style='color: blue'><b>Cimon</b></span> "obtained great repute among the Athenians" due to his courage in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>
