Battle of Thermopylae, Battle in northern Greece (480 BC) in the Persian Wars. Ten years after the defeat at Marathon, the Persian invasion of Greece was resumed by King <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes I</b></span> in 480 BCE. A Spartan-led Greek army led by Leonidas tried to block the Persian advance at the pass of Thermopylae but was defeated despite brave resistance against overwhelming odds. After three days of holding their own against the Persian king Xerxes I and his vast southward-advancing army, the Greeks were betrayed, and the Persians were able to outflank them.
