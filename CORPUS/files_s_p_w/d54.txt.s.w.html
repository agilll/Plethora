<span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> (spelled by <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> as Ἀστυάγης <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>; by <span style='color: blue'><b>Ctesias</b></span> as Astyigas; by Diodorus as Aspadas; <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Babylonian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Babylon</b></span>: Ištumegu) was the last king of the Median <span style='color: blue'><b>Empire</b></span>, r. 585–550 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, the son of <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyaxares</b></span>; he was dethroned in 550 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>. His name derives from the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Old Iranian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Iranian_languages</b></span> Rishti <span style='color: blue'><b>Vaiga</b></span>, which means "swinging the spear, lance-hurler."[1] In the inscriptions of <span style='color: blue'><b>Nabonidus</b></span> the name is written Ishtuvegu.[2]
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> succeeded his father in 585 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, following the Battle of Halys, which ended a five-year war between the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lydians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lydia</b></span> and the <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span>. He inherited a large empire, ruled in alliance with his two brothers-in-law, <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Nebuchadnezzar</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nebuchadnezzar_II</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span>, whose wife, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Amytis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Amytis_of_Media</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>' sister, was the queen for whom <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Nebuchadnezzar</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Nebuchadnezzar_II</b></span> was said to have built the Hanging Gardens of <span style='color: blue'><b>Babylon</b></span>.[3] However, due to recent evidence, the garden was likely built by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Assyrian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Assyria</b></span> King <span style='color: blue'><b>Sennacherib</b></span>. Married to <span style='color: blue'><b>Aryenis</b></span>, the sister of King <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span>, to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>seal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cylinder_seal</b></span> the treaty between the two empires, <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> ascended to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> throne upon his father's death later that year.[4]
<br>
<br>The ancient sources report almost nothing about <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>’ reign, and a final judgment on his character is not possible, since <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>’ negative account (<span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> is represented as a cruel and despotic ruler) and <span style='color: blue'><b>Ctesias</b></span>’ favorable one, are both biased.[5] According to <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyropaedia</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Xenophon</b></span>, after thirty-two years of relative stability, <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> lost the support of his nobles during the war against <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>, whom <span style='color: blue'><b>Xenophon</b></span> understands as being <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>' grandson. This resulted in the founding of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> empire by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>.[6]
<br>
<br>The account given by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>ancient Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> historian <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> relates that <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> had a dream in which his daughter, Mandane, gave birth to a son who would destroy his empire. Fearful of the dream's prophecy, <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> married her off to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_I</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Anšan</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anshan_(Persia)</b></span>, who had a reputation for being a "quiet and thoughtful prince" and whom <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> believed to be no threat. When a second dream warned <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> of the dangers of Mandane's offspring, <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> sent his general <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> to kill the child <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> correctly names <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>' parents, though he fails to mention that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cambyses I</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cambyses_I</b></span> was a king.[7][8] Modern scholarship generally rejects his claim that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> was the grandson of <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>.[9] <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span>, unwilling to spill royal <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>blood</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Food_and_drink_prohibitions</b></span>, gave the infant to a shepherd, Mitridates, whose wife had just given birth to a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>stillborn</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Stillbirth</b></span> child. Mitridates, or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Mithridates</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mithridates_VI_of_Pontus</b></span>, is connected to <span style='color: blue'><b>Mithra</b></span> (compare <span style='color: blue'><b>Faustulus</b></span>) who discovered <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Romulus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Romulus_and_Remus</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Remus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Romulus_and_Remus</b></span>, and his connection with <span style='color: blue'><b>Faunus</b></span>.[citation needed] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> was raised as Mitridates' own son, and <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> presented the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>stillborn</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Stillbirth</b></span> child to <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> as the dead <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>. When <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> was found alive at age ten, <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> spared the boy on the advice of his <span style='color: blue'><b>Magi</b></span>, returning him to his parents in <span style='color: blue'><b>Anshan</b></span>. <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span>, however, did not escape punishment, as <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> is said to have fed him his own son at a banquet. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> succeeded his father in 559, and in 553, on the advice of <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span>, who was eager for revenge for being given the "abominable supper," <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> rebelled against <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>. After three years of fighting, <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>' troops mutinied during the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Pasargadae</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> conquered the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span>'s empire. <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> was spared by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>, and despite being taunted by <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> says he was treated well and remained in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>' court until his death. Rather than giving the popular <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mythology</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Greek_mythology</b></span> that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> was suckled by a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dog</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dog</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dog</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dog</b></span> was sacred to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>. cf. also the legend of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sargon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sargon_II</b></span>, or the similar legend of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Romulus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Romulus_and_Remus</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Remus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Romulus_and_Remus</b></span>, suckled by a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>she-wolf</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lupercal</b></span>. (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Latin</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Latins</b></span>: Lupa) <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> explains that the herdsman Mitridates lived with another of <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>' slaves, a woman named 'Spaco,' which he explains is <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Median</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Medes</b></span> for "<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>dog</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dog</b></span>."[10][11] gives both the legend and <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>' rationalized version.[12]
<br>
<br>The contemporary Chronicle of <span style='color: blue'><b>Nabonidus</b></span> refers to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mutiny</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mutiny</b></span> on the battlefield as the cause for <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>' overthrow, but does not mention <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> by name. However, since <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> was <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>' general at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Pasargadae</b></span> and his family were granted high positions in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>' empire after the war, and since <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> went on to become <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>' most successful general, it is possible he had something to do with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>mutiny</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Mutiny</b></span> against <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>.[13] <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> then went on to capture <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>' capital of <span style='color: blue'><b>Ecbatana</b></span>. Ancient sources agree that after <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> was taken by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> he was treated with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>clemency</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pardon</b></span>, though the accounts differ. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> says that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> kept <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span> at his court during the remainder of his life, while according to <span style='color: blue'><b>Ctesias</b></span>, he was made a governor of a region of <span style='color: blue'><b>Parthia</b></span> and was later murdered by a political opponent, Oebaras. The circumstances of <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>' death are not known. After <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>' overthrow, <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span> marched on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span> to avenge <span style='color: blue'><b>Astyages</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Cyrus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Cyrus_the_Great</b></span>, with <span style='color: blue'><b>Harpagus</b></span> at his side, defeated <span style='color: blue'><b>Croesus</b></span> and conquered <span style='color: blue'><b>Lydia</b></span> in or after 547 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>
