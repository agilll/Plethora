<br>With defeat at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span>, the inconclusive <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>naval battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naval_warfare</b></span> at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemision</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artemisium</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>â€™ <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> army on the rampage, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> city-states faced an unprecedented attack, one which threatened their very existence. The tide would turn, though, in September 480 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> at the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Saronic Gulf</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Saronic_Gulf</b></span>, a <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>naval battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naval_warfare</b></span> which would rank as one of the greatest and most significant in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>antiquity</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>. Overcoming superior numbers with daring tactics and sheer determination, the allied <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> forces won a freedom which would allow a never-before-seen period of artistic and cultural <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>endeavour</span> <span style='color: green'><b>HMS_Endeavour</b></span> which would form the foundations of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Western culture</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Western_world</b></span> for millennia. 
<br>
<br>By the first years of the 5th century <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, under the rule of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span> (r. 522-486 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>), was already expanding into mainland <span style='color: blue'><b>Europe</b></span> and had subjugated <span style='color: blue'><b>Thrace</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Macedonia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Republic_of_Macedonia</b></span>. The next objective was to quell once and for all the collection of potentially troublesome rebel states on the western border of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span>. In 490 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> forces led by <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> met the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Marathon</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Marathon</b></span> and defeated the invaders. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> would take on mythical status amongst the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, but in reality it was merely the opening <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>overture</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Overture</b></span> of a long war with several other battles making up the principal acts. In 486 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> became king, and he invaded first the <span style='color: blue'><b>Cyclades</b></span> and then the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> mainland after victory at <span style='color: blue'><b>Thermopylae</b></span> in August 480 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span> against a token <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> force. At the indecisive <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>naval battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naval_warfare</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemision</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artemisium</b></span> (also in August 480 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>), the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> held off the superior numbers of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet but were obliged to regroup at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> then, lay open to the invaders and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> forces rampaged through the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>poleis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Polis</b></span> or city-states, sacking even <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> itself. Some 30 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>poleis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Polis</b></span>, however, were preparing to fight back and the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> would show <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> that <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, or at least a large chunk of it, was far from being conquered.  
<br>
<br>The vast Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span> stretched from the <span style='color: blue'><b>Danube</b></span> to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egypt</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ptolemaic_Kingdom</b></span> and from <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionia</b></span> to <span style='color: blue'><b>Bactria</b></span>, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> was able to draw on a huge <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>reserve</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Military_reserve</b></span> of resources to amass a huge invasion force. <span style='color: blue'><b>Ariabignes</b></span>, the son of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Darius</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Darius_I</b></span>, commanded the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Carian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Carians</b></span>, Achaimene, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> fleets. Cybernis, the king of <span style='color: blue'><b>Xanthos</b></span>, led the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Lycian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Lycia</b></span> fleet of 50 ships. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemisia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artemisia_I_of_Caria</b></span>, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>tyrant</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tyrant</b></span> of Halicarnassus, led the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Dorian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Dorians</b></span> fleet of 30 ships and other known commanders included Prexaspes, <span style='color: blue'><b>Megabazus</b></span>, and Achaimenes. Technically, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span>, and especially the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenicians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span>, were better seamen, but as the fleet was drawn from all parts of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Empire</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Roman_Empire</b></span>, the motivation and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>communication</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Communication</b></span> levels were perhaps less than their opponents who all spoke the same language and who were fighting not only for their own survival but that of their families and their way of life.
<br>
<br>The exact number of ships in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet is not known. <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> in his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Histories</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Herodotus</b></span> (440-430 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>) compiles precise lists but these are widely thought to be exaggerated and unreliable. Also, his list is for the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet which originally sailed to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> waters and by the time of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span>, many would have been left to guard ports and supply routes or have been lost in storms (especially at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Magnesia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Magnesia_Prefecture</b></span>) and in the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemision</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artemisium</b></span> a month earlier. Nevertheless, below are his figures for triremes  - warships with three banks of oars (note the contributions from conquered or pro-Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> cities):
<br>
<br>An alternative source - the writer of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek tragedy</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Theatre_of_ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeschylus</b></span> - does seem to support <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span> in his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persae</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> (472 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>)  where he states that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet had 1,207 ships compared to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> force of only 310. Accounting for losses incurred in the manner described above it is estimated that perhaps around 500 triremes faced the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> but there is no scholarly consensus on even an approximate figure. There would also have been many smaller ships such as penteconters (50 oars) and triaconters (30 oars) but <span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>â€™ figure of 3000 seems wildly exaggerated.
<br>
<br>The allied <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet was commanded by the Spartan <span style='color: blue'><b>Eurybiades</b></span>, a surprising choice considering it was <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> who was the great naval power and supplied by far the most ships. The two other senior commanders were <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Adeimantus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Adeimantus_of_Corinth</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span>. In effect, tactics and strategy were decided by a council of 17 commanders from each of the contributing contingents. However, it is <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, the brilliant naval commander, drawing on his twenty-year experience and flush from the success of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemision</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artemisium</b></span> against far superior numbers, who is widely credited with deciding to hold position at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> instead of retreating to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>isthmus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Isthmus_of_Corinth</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Corinth</b></span> and masterminding the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> victory.
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue'><b>Herodotus</b></span>â€™ figures are once again inconsistent, his grand total of 380 triremes making up the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet is 15 more than the sum of his individual state contributions:
<br>
<br>The figures for some states are suspiciously similar to those given before the Battle of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemision</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artemisium</b></span>, implausibly suggesting either they suffered next to no losses in that conflict or a swift replacement of vessels. <span style='color: blue'><b>Aeschylus</b></span> states a total figure of 310 and <span style='color: blue'><b>Thucydides</b></span> 400. In summary, we can only say that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> fleet seems to have significantly outnumbered the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Both sides had very similar ships - the triremes (triÄ“rÄ“is) - which were 40-50 ton wooden warships up to 40 m long. Light, streamlined, and manoeuvrable, they were powered in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> by 170 oarsmen split in three ranks down each side of the ship. Able to rapidly accelerate, break, zigzag, and turn 360 degrees in just two shipsâ€™ <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>lengths</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Horse</b></span>, good seamanship could place the vessel to best advantage and employ the principal strategy of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>naval warfare</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Naval_warfare</b></span> at that time which was to ram the enemy, making full use of the bronze ram fitted to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>prow</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Prow</b></span> of the vessel. Triremes also carried a small complement of  soldiers, at least 10 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> and four archers. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> generally carried more - 14 combatants and 30 <span style='color: blue'><b>Medes</b></span> armed with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>bow</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Bow_and_arrow</b></span>, spear, and <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sword</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sword</b></span>. These extra troops came into their own when at close quarters with the enemy and in the case of boarding an enemy vessel. 
<br>
<br>Triremes had a weakness in that they could only operate effectively in relatively calm seas with waves less than 1 m high; otherwise, water would enter via the oar-ports and flood the ship. Also, they had to stay close to shore as each night they needed to be beached if the light <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>wood</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Wood</b></span> was not to become water-logged, significantly reducing the speed performance of the vessel. In addition, there was very little space on board for provisions and no room to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>sleep</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Sleep</b></span> so the crews had no choice but to land each night. Prior to the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> ships were beached at several bays on the island of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> from Cynosoura to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Paloukia</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Salamis_Island</b></span>. Here too were much of the evacuated populace of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athens</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Attica</b></span>. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span>, meanwhile, were stationed at the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phaleron Bay</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phalerum</b></span>, less than 10 km away across the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Saronic Gulf</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Saronic_Gulf</b></span> and close to the captured <span style='color: blue'><b>Piraeus</b></span>.
<br>
<br>Commanders led from the front and each would have been on his own ship at the heart of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>. From there, manoeuvres could be signalled to other ships in the fleet using flags and trumpets. However, once the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> got fully underway, naval conflicts became a case of a single ship against a single opponent rather than precisely coordinated manoeuvres.
<br>
<br>Prior to full engagement between the opposing fleets, there were two principal strategies employed by the more able commanders. The first was sailing around the enemy line (periplous) and the second was smashing through gaps in the enemy line and attacking from their rear flank (diekplous). Both were designed to get oneâ€™s ship in a position to ram the weakest point of the enemy - the side or <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>stern</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Stern</b></span> quarter. The objective was to puncture a hole in the enemy vessel or break a sufficient number of their oars to disable the ship. To avoid damaging oneâ€™s own oars, crews were drilled to withdraw them in a matter of seconds (usually on only one side of the ship whilst the other side maintained the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>momentum</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Momentum</b></span> of the vessel). As a defence against these two tactics, an able commander would ensure one of his flanks was closed off by shallows or coastline and ensure his crews were sufficiently drilled to maintain close order. In open water the ships could be organised in a defensive <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>circle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Circle</b></span> or an arc (more practical with larger fleets) with prows pointing outwards (<span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>kyklos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Kyklos</b></span>).
<br>
<br><span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The actual</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Actual_(band)</b></span> details of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> are sketchy and often contradictory between ancient sources. Nevertheless, presenting the most commonly agreed upon elements, the first action of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> was the defection of two <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Ionian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ionia</b></span> ships to the allied <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet. <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span>, perhaps sending messages to the pro-Persian <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> state fleets, had hoped for more such defections but no others occurred. One such ship from <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Tenos</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Tinos</b></span> informed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were amassing in the straits, blocking in the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> had moved into position overnight, hoping to surprise the enemy, but this strategy was unlikely to be successful considering the short distances involved and the noise made by the rowers. There is also the possibility that <span style='color: blue'><b>Themistocles</b></span> had sent messages to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> intimating the fragile <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> alliance was breaking up and the fleet was about to retreat.
<br>
<br>Probably, the two fleets aligned along an oblique east-west axis with the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> close to the mainland shore with both fleets having a friendly shore behind them. Indeed, proximity to the opposite mainland shore would have been avoided by the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> ships due to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>â€™ positioning there of a contingent of his archers. On the western (right) wing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Phoenicians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Phoenicia</b></span> faced the Athenians and the <span style='color: blue'><b>Ionians</b></span> against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Spartans</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Spartan_army</b></span>. On the left flank of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> were the <span style='color: blue'><b>Carians</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Dorians</b></span>. Behind the main <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> line, the <span style='color: blue'><b>Aegina</b></span> contingent and some of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Athenian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Classical_Athens</b></span> ships waited in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>reserve</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Military_reserve</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Corinth</b></span> were stationed to the west of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> lines protecting the passage to <span style='color: blue'><b>Eleusis</b></span> whilst the pro-Persian Cyprians, Cilicians, and Hellespontines held back to the south, guarding the exit to <span style='color: blue'><b>Piraeus</b></span>. According to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Diodorus Siculus</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Diodorus_Siculus</b></span>, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> sent his <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Egyptian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Egypt</b></span> fleet to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>seal</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Pinniped</b></span> off the straits between <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> and <span style='color: blue'><b>Megara</b></span> and engage any <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> ships breaking off from the main fleet.

<br>Overlooking from his command post in the early morning, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> would have seen not a fleet about to retreat but the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> positioned two-ships deep along a 3 km long curve, perhaps presenting a line of 130 ships against the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> main front of 150 ships, three ships deep. <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>The Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>The_Persians</b></span> advanced, becoming more closely packed as they aligned themselves with the enemyâ€™s narrower front. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> held position, drawing the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> into an ever tighter <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>confine</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Confine</b></span>. Ships began to ram each other and in the tight space they would have struggled to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>disengage</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Disengage_(album)</b></span>. Then the armed soldiers on board would have come into their own with <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplites</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> and archers fighting on the decks much as in a land <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span>. With more <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> ships pressing in from the rear and the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Corinthians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Corinth</b></span> joining from the side, there must have been a chaos of broken ships and drowning men - particularly amongst the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> who had no shore to retreat to and most probably could not swim.
<br>
<br>With more space to manoeuvre, the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> ships were able to pick off the closely packed <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> vessels which could not retreat because their lines were now several ships deep. By the afternoon, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> victory was assured and the remaining <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> ships retreated to <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Asia Minor</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Anatolia</b></span>. The final stage of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> was the transferral of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> force on <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Salamis</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Salamis</b></span> over to the mainland which then made short work of the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> land forces. 
<br>
<br>Once again the cryptic <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>oracle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Delphi</b></span> of <span style='color: blue'><b>Apollo</b></span> at <span style='color: blue'><b>Delphi</b></span> had been proved right: â€˜only a wooden wall will keep you safeâ€™. As at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Artemision</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Artemisium</b></span>, the wooden ships of the combined <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greek</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> fleet had, for a second time, rebuffed the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> advance.
<br>
<br>Following defeat, <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span> returned home to his palace at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Sousa</span> <span style='color: green'><b>John_Philip_Sousa</b></span> and left the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>gifted</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Child_prodigy</b></span> general <span style='color: blue'><b>Mardonius</b></span> in charge of the invasion. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persian</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> position was still strong despite the defeat - they still controlled much of <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span> and their large land army was intact. After a series of political negotiations, it became clear that the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Persians</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Achaemenid_Empire</b></span> would not gain victory on land through diplomacy and the two opposing armies met at <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Plataea</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle_of_Plataea</b></span> in August 479 <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>BCE</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Common_Era</b></span>. The <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greeks</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>, fielding the largest <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>hoplite</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Hoplite</b></span> army ever seen, won the <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>battle</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Battle</b></span> and finally ended <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Xerxes</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Xerxes_I</b></span>â€™ ambitions in <span style='color: blue; text-decoration:line-through'>Greece</span> <span style='color: green'><b>Ancient_Greece</b></span>
