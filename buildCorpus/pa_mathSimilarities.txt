1. OBJECTIVES:-
-------------

The aim of this class is to provide simple math functions that could be inherited for
measuring text similarities.


2. COMPONENTS:-
-------------

This file contains a class mathSimilarity() that has five (5) math similarity functions:
- cosine_similarity()
- jaccard_similarity()
- euclidean_distance()
- manhattan_distance()
- minkowski_distance()

Beside other two (2) functions:
- nth_root()
- square_rooted()


3. DESCRIPTION:-
--------------

- cosine_similarity(x, y): Cosine similarity metric finds the normalized dot product of the two attributes.
By determining the cosine similarity, we would effectively try to find the cosine of the angle between the two
objects. The cosine of 0Â° is 1, and it is less than 1 for any other angle. takes two parameters x and y, which
are lists, measures the cosine similarity between them, and returns the value as a float. For two identical lists,
cosine similarity = 1.

- jaccard_similarity(x, y): Jaccard similarity is the cardinality of the intersection of sets divided by the
cardinality of the union of the sets. The function takes two parameters x and y, which are lists, measures the
Jaccard similarity between them, and returns the value as a float. For two identical lists, Jaccard similarity = 1.

- euclidean_distance(x, y): The Euclidean distance between two points is the length of the path connecting them.
The function takes two parameters x and y, which are lists, measures the euclidean distance
between them, and returns the value as a float. For two identical lists, euclidean distance = 0.
The euclidean distance measures the dissimilarity, so the more the value, the less the similarity.

- manhattan_distance(x, y): Manhattan distance is a metric in which the distance between two points is the sum of the
absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates. It is the total sum of the difference between the x-coordinates
and y-coordinates. The function takes two parameters x and y, which are lists, measures the manhattan distance
between them, and returns the value as a float. For two identical lists, manhattan distance = 0.
The manhattan distance measures the dissimilarity, so the more the value, the less the similarity.

- minkowski_distance(x, y, p_value): The Minkowski distance is a generalized metric form of Euclidean distance and Manhattan
distance. The function takes three parameters x, y and p-value,  x and y are lists, p-value takes a real number
(The case where p = 1 is equivalent to the Manhattan distance and the case where p = 2 is equivalent to the Euclidean
distance. It is typically set to a value between 1 and 2), measures the Minkowski distance between them, and returns
the value as a float. For two identical lists, Minkowski distance = 0. The Minkowski distance measures the dissimilarity,
so the more the value, the less the similarity.

- nth_root(value, n_root): This function returns the nth root of an value. It is used in this class by the minkowski_distance()
function.

- square_rooted(x): This function returns 3 rounded square rooted value. It is used in this class by the cosine_similarity()
function.
